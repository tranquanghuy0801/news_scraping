Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak. It feels as though our history textbooks have come to life, doesn‚Äôt it?Vania Zakerfathi, 14, Asquith Lola Christopoulos, 11, from Drummoyne.Credit:Lola Christopoulos 2020 began with blackened skies and a constant dangerous smoky haze as we dealt with the threat of the massive bushfires surrounding us in the Snowy Mountains. However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I‚Äôve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don‚Äôt want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‚ÄòMum‚Äô again but this time I was actually right! It‚Äôs been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all ‚Äì in a way that a son caught smoking his father‚Äôs cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the ‚Äúcan robots replace teachers one day?‚Äù debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun ‚Äì almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: ‚ÄúIsn't this exciting!‚Äù I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I‚Äôve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we‚Äôd have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me ‚Äì well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can‚Äôt explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you‚Äôre feeling lazy you don‚Äôt have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can‚Äôt socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum‚Äôs second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I‚Äôm on call, and whilst I‚Äôm explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad ‚Äì Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch ‚Äì and my dad always wins üôÅRaushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I‚Äôve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling ‚Äì I‚Äôve learnt to draw! Something I‚Äôve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I‚Äôve broken my soccer juggling record ‚Äì I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too ‚Äì NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don‚Äôt get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it‚Äôs lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling‚Äôs teasing, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it‚Äôs slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn‚Äôt want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I‚Äôm not surrounded by peers. We‚Äôre forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It‚Äôs starting to take a toll on me, and I know I‚Äôm not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren‚Äôt for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself ‚Ä¶ Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It‚Äôs the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it‚Äôs like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn‚Äôt have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we‚Äôve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon ‚Äì and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I‚Äôm still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can‚Äôt help but be sad that we‚Äôre missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I‚Äôve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I‚Äôm constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn‚Äôt fill me with motivation. I‚Äôm not a super eager student and I never thought I‚Äôd say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can‚Äôt see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can‚Äôt pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can‚Äôt hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update¬†newsletter¬†for the day‚Äôs crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren‚Äôt for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself ‚Ä¶ Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It‚Äôs the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it‚Äôs like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn‚Äôt have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we‚Äôve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon ‚Äì and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I‚Äôm still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can‚Äôt help but be sad that we‚Äôre missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I‚Äôve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I‚Äôm constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn‚Äôt fill me with motivation. I‚Äôm not a super eager student and I never thought I‚Äôd say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can‚Äôt see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can‚Äôt pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can‚Äôt hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update¬†newsletter¬†for the day‚Äôs crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

As schools prepare to deliver term two online, federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said leaders needed to think about how to ensure an ""orderly return"" when circumstances changed, avoiding a deluge of students when older or vulnerable teachers were unable to return. The NSW Teachers Federation says year 12 and kindy should be given priority when schools reopen. ""An option could be a staggered return to our schools,"" he said. ""I've advanced a proposition that part of an orderly [process], we could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out."" Educators cautiously welcomed the idea, although they said the process would be complicated and schools would need to be consulted. It comes as Education Minister Dan Tehan said ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week?"" he said. ""Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students - would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the government will be using the school holiday period to consider its options for term two and beyond. ‚ÄúWe will communicate this with school communities before school returns. All options will be considered in line with health advice,‚Äù she said. While pandemic experts say children are not believed to drive the spread of COVID-19, teachers have been concerned about their safety, particularly those who are older or have underlying conditions. A 2017 workforce survey found the average age of NSW teachers is 37, but up to a fifth are over 50. Before they began holidays on Thursday afternoon, NSW schools were not closed but were delivering remote learning to everyone, and parents were encouraged to keep their children at home. About 94 per cent of families did so. By this week, two thirds of the public school teaching workforce were working from home. Schools have prepared to deliver term two lessons online. But as parents feel the stress of supervising students while working, or students become more restless about learning alone, some predict the number of students attending schools will rise. Craig Petersen, head of the Secondary Principals Council, said the danger of allowing students to return whenever their parents chose could lead to a situation in which there were more students at school than teachers available. An ordered return - prioritising high-needs years as suggested by the federation - made sense, but it would be complicated, he said. Year 12 teachers, for example, might have an underlying health condition, while some schools ran a ""compressed curriculum"" in which years 10 and 11 also did HSC subjects. ""This needs to be carefully thought through,"" Mr Petersen said. ""It introduces a whole range of complexities. What we need is for the principals' associations, for the federation, and for educators to be consulted."" Replay   Mr Petersen said parents were already ringing schools, confused about what to expect next term. ""We have to have clarity around this, schools cannot be left in this position where we become the target of parental concern and anxiety about decision we have no control over,"" he said. ""We are extremely frustrated with the lack of consultation and consideration for what's in the best interests of our students."" Jenny Allum, the principal of SCEGGS Darlinghurst, said schools had proven their ability to respond to changing circumstances over the past month. She said a staged return was ""certainly a possibility"", especially one involving year 12 as a priority. ""You can have 24 [year 12] kids working in three classrooms with one teacher, you can't have a class of 24 kindergarten kids in three classrooms with one teacher,"" she said.

As federal, state and territory governments confront the major disruption to this year's teaching, assessments and exams ‚Äì with the vast majority of students forced to learn from home ‚Äì ANU has moved to open up early domestic undergraduate applications for 2021. Australian National University chancellor Julie Bishop.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer ""The Australian National University recognises the enormous disruption and uncertainty for year 12 students with the challenge of the response to the coronavirus,"" said ANU chancellor Julie Bishop. ""So students will have to complete their year 12 studies but this will give greater certainty ... They can focus on completing their studies, knowing that if their marks in year 11 meet our entry requirements, they can be admitted to one of the world‚Äôs best universities."" Applications are open until May 25 and offers will be made in August. The university is urging students to use the April school holidays to apply. ANU will likely make 3000-3500 offers with the aim of 2500 confirmed enrolments. Students will have guaranteed spots in student accommodation and scholarships are available. Ms Bishop said the initiative would ""hopefully remove much of the stress and anxiety of undertaking year 12 studies this year"" amid unprecedented disruption. Some students will also be admitted to ANU based on their year 12 results in another round of offers. ANU has confidence in the pre-emptive strategy because it had already introduced a new admissions process for students, starting this year, which takes into account earlier academic results, extracurricular activities and personal circumstances alongside ATARs. Vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt said it had worked well, with academic achievement in year 11 correlating reliably with ATAR performance. ""We were able to predict with almost 98 per cent accuracy,"" he said. Professor Schmidt encouraged students to work hard in year 12 anyway because university subjects ""are not easy"". Replay   Federal, state and territory education ministers have been working to adapt school systems and tertiary education admissions amid the pandemic.

As federal, state and territory governments confront the major disruption to this year's teaching, assessments and exams ‚Äì with the vast majority of students forced to learn from home ‚Äì ANU has moved to open up early domestic undergraduate applications for 2021. Australian National University chancellor Julie Bishop.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer ""The Australian National University recognises the enormous disruption and uncertainty for year 12 students with the challenge of the response to the coronavirus,"" said ANU chancellor Julie Bishop. ""So students will have to complete their year 12 studies but this will give greater certainty ... They can focus on completing their studies, knowing that if their marks in year 11 meet our entry requirements, they can be admitted to one of the world‚Äôs best universities."" Applications are open until May 25 and offers will be made in August. The university is urging students to use the April school holidays to apply. ANU will likely make 3000-3500 offers with the aim of 2500 confirmed enrolments. Students will have guaranteed spots in student accommodation and scholarships are available. Ms Bishop said the initiative would ""hopefully remove much of the stress and anxiety of undertaking year 12 studies this year"" amid unprecedented disruption. Some students will also be admitted to ANU based on their year 12 results in another round of offers. ANU has confidence in the pre-emptive strategy because it had already introduced a new admissions process for students, starting this year, which takes into account earlier academic results, extracurricular activities and personal circumstances alongside ATARs. Vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt said it had worked well, with academic achievement in year 11 correlating reliably with ATAR performance. ""We were able to predict with almost 98 per cent accuracy,"" he said. Professor Schmidt encouraged students to work hard in year 12 anyway because university subjects ""are not easy"".

An Auditor-General's report, released on Wednesday, also found principals had been given poor support to manage the money, inconsistent advice on how to spend it, and complicated, ineffective ways to account for it. ""The department has not had adequate oversight of how schools are using needs-based equity funding to improve student outcomes since [the Local Schools, Local Decisions policy] was introduced in 2014,"" the report said. The NSW Department of Education did not keep track of hundreds of millions of dollars in disadvantage funding.Credit:Michele Mossop It had not set targets for outcomes, or requirements to report those outcomes. ""Consequently, there is no effective mechanism to capture the impact of funding at a school, or statewide level,"" it said. The department is setting new targets this year. Local Schools, Local Decisions was introduced in 2012 to let principals make decisions based on the needs of their school community. At the same time, extra money flowed to disadvantaged students under the Gonski reforms. In 2019, schools received $907 million in equity funding, having increased almost nine per cent a year while student numbers grew 1.1 per cent. From 2015, funding grew by more than $250 million, the equivalent of 8500 teachers. The auditor, Margaret Crawford, found the department had not been clear about the purpose of that funding, which has meant, ""it is hard to know if initiatives are on track. This makes it difficult to hold schools and the department accountable."" Schools did have some forms of accountability, such as a school plan and a director to oversee it. But directors did not feel confident in their financial abilities, and rules for school plans were overly complex, the report said. If schools fail to improve outcomes, the department can review the plan or send the principal to an improvement program. Of 2200 schools, three development reviews and seven improvement programs have been completed since 2015. Of the 12 schools reviewed by the auditor, none spent their full allocations because they struggled to find staff and distrusted their financial tools. At the end of 2018, $1.3 billion in education funding had been left unspent. Principals described the finance systems as 'designed for accountants', 'overwhelmingly detailed', and 'intensively complex'. English language and disability funding was more likely to reach those students than funding for Aboriginal and students of low socio-economic background, which was often spent on whole-school programs. Craig Petersen, head of the Secondary Principals Council, said some of the suggestions were reasonable, but school plans were internal documents that did not contain the full picture. ""A lot of stuff sits behind that, which is business as usual, while the plan focuses on new strategies,"" he said. ""Every secondary school wants to improve their HSC results, for example; that doesn't mean it's in every plan."" Greens MP David Shoebridge, a critic of Local Schools, Local Decisions, called for the policy to be ""immediately scrapped"". ""Imagine how many children‚Äôs lives could have been lifted up if these funds were spent directly on programs that are proven to help rather than spread so haphazardly across the state?"" he said.

In an email to staff on Wednesday, vice-chancellor Michael Spence said the university's census on March 31 - the last date for students to change their enrolment - clarified its financial position. It showed a total of 9.9 per cent fewer students than the university had planned for in 2020, including 4.8 per cent fewer domestic students and 16.8 per cent fewer international students, ""which has significant revenue implications,"" he said. Sydney University expects a $470 million hit to its bottom line as a result of COVID-19.Credit:Louise Kennerley The university was assessing what that meant for its financial position, taking into account the expected hit to second semester domestic and international enrolments, and extra costs related to COVID-19. ""[There have been] additional expenses of $55m as a result of COVID-19, for example additional cleaning, technology resources to support online teaching, and provision of student support and hardship funding,"" Mr Spence said. ""With these considerations in mind, we estimate the university‚Äôs COVID-19 related shortfall for this year will be $470m."" A spokeswoman for the University of NSW said its census showed a 30 per cent drop in the number of international students for its first trimester, while domestic enrolments were as expected. At UNSW, the vice-chancellor, deputy-vice-chancellor, provost and senior leadership team (including the deans) had taken a 20 per cent pay cut, the spokeswoman said. Universities have been using significant revenue from international students, particularly Chinese students, to fund capital works and research. But international travel restrictions are unlikely to be lifted by the time Sydney University's second semester begins in August, or UNSW's second trimester starts in June. English testing centres in China remain closed, which will also impact the pipeline of potential students next year. Australian National University's vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt on Tuesday said universities would be permanently transformed by the crisis, as revenue from international students dried up and financial losses impacted on teaching and research. He said the government and universities had to start ""co-designing the future"" for the sector. The international education market has been a significant contributor to the NSW economy.

For the first time this year, students have to meet standards in reading, writing and numeracy to obtain their HSC qualification. Most students in the class of 2020 have already met the requirements, but thousands have not. Principals and teachers said enforcing the standards this year would hurt the students already hardest-hit by the crisis.

""We really need to hold off this year, it would be a disaster. The kids who aren't meeting the standard are the most disadvantaged kids and they need the most support. We just aren't in the position to provide that for them."" One principal of a disadvantaged school, who did not want to be named, said facilitating the test would be a ""nightmare"", and exacerbate equity issues that have already been starkly exposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Students who have not yet met the standards are less likely to have internet or computer access at home, or to have an educated, English-speaking parent to support them. ""They are also the ones whose family are more likely to be falling apart at the seams on some level,"" the principal said. ""These kids need some guidance, someone who can see them, have faith in them, and knows what kind of direction they need. Also, if they are doing the test at home, what's to stop the older sibling or their parent doing it?"" Another principal said the students who were yet to meet the standard required one-on-one teaching, ""but we aren't allowed to have one-on-one video conferencing."" To receive their HSC certificate, students need to meet the minimum standards in literacy, numeracy and reading for the first time in 2020. They can do the test twice a year between year 10 and year 12, and for five years after they begin the HSC. Meanwhile, Education Minister Dan Tehan reiterated that the class of 2020 would graduate this year, and ""there will be no year 13. There will be no mass repeating of year 12.""

The findings reflect the Australian government's wariness towards the hardline measure and concern about the potential impacts.

The researchers found data from the SARS outbreak in China, Hong Kong and Singapore in 2003 suggested school closures ""did not contribute"" to the control of the epidemic. ""Data on the benefit of school closures in the COVID-19 outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared with other infection-control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to,"" said UCL's Russell Viner, the study's lead author. The paper found the economic costs and potential harms of closure to be ""undoubtedly very high"". ""Children's education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most,"" Professor Viner said. While the Morrison government has maintained the official medical advice is schools should remain open, state governments have pushed ahead with ending ordinary school operations while making provisions for disadvantaged students and children of essential workers.

""But we believe there is not an evidence base to say that keeping children from [school] is a strong public health measure on the current evidence that we have,"" Professor Murphy said. Concerned about the spread of COVID-19, parents started pulling their children out of school in large numbers last month. The governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions concerned about the welfare of staff, especially the elderly and those with medical conditions.

The alarm from the sector, which has suffered major losses in international student revenue since the outbreak, came after universities were denied greater access to the JobKeeper wage subsidy despite easing of eligibility conditions for organisations with charity status. Replay   Universities Australia, the peak body for the country's 39 universities, said on Monday it was now clear there would be a ""significant"" decline in international student numbers in second semester and government support was ""more important than ever"". ""A conservative estimate of the revenue decline that will hit the sector is between $3 billion [and] $4.6 billion. Universities estimate that more than 21,000 jobs are at risk in the next six months, and more after that,"" Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said in a statement. Noting the economic impact of universities and the 259,000 full-time jobs in the sector, she said support was needed to maintain education and research ‚Äì including on treatments for COVID-19. ""It is crucial universities remain viable today so they are able maximise their contribution to Australia's economic recovery tomorrow,"" Ms Jackson said. The university sector was confused on Monday following Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's announcement.Credit:   Alex Ellinghausen She also called for the government to provide more support for international students out of work and facing barriers to get home. The students are also benefiting from hardship funds announced by the universities. The university sector was plunged into confusion on Monday following an announcement by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg that ""all registered charities"" would be able to access the JobKeeper subsidy if they demonstrate a 15 per cent turnover decline, a lower bar than regular businesses, which  must demonstrate a 30 per cent turnover decline if their revenue is under $1 billion and 50 per cent if it is above $1 billion. It is not clear if the government was aware non-government schools and Australia's 37 public universities were among the charities formally registered with the Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission. But on Monday afternoon it was clarified universities and schools would not be eligible for the 15 per cent threshold, which Assistant Minister for Charities Zed Seselja said was targeted at organisations like the Salvation Army. ""This supports charities that are expected to have a significant increase in demand for their services,"" he said. ""Non-government schools and universities are eligible for the JobKeeper Payment. However, they will need to meet the turnover threshold of 30 per cent for those with an annual turnover of less than $1 billion."" Ms Jackson said the sector was ""disappointed to have been excluded"" from the arrangements and would continue discussions with the government about possible support for universities. ""As not-for-profit charities, we welcomed the Treasurer‚Äôs announcement about amendments to JobKeeper that would have seen most universities included. It would have backed our ability to reduce job losses,"" she said.  Vicki Thomson, chief executive of the Group of Eight universities, had embraced the initial announcement and said Mr Frydenberg had been ""unambiguous"" the lower threshold would apply to all registered charities. ""And that includes our universities who operate on a not for profit basis ‚Äì and we expect government to follow through on that basis ... not shift the ground rules in less than a day,"" she said.

Australian education is currently in a state of limbo. Schools are notionally open, but most students are at home; some receiving online learning, others essentially doing home-schooling, and some not learning much at all. Those at school often aren't receiving an education to equal their pre-coronavirus lessons. Despite expert advice to the national cabinet last week that it was safe for schools to stay open, parents were told to keep their children at home unless they can‚Äôt look after them during school hours. NSW schools now have an absentee rate of around 90 per cent ‚Äî and there is wide variation between states and sectors. Kids need to get back to normal lessons.Credit:SMH The small proportion of students still attending school might benefit from the smaller class sizes and quieter corridors. But teachers are busy simultaneously trying to teach them and also send tasks to the students learning at home. It's likely the quality of the education they are getting is not consistent from class to class and school to school. This can‚Äôt go on for long without having a significant negative impact on student learning, especially for students from disadvantaged social backgrounds. Governments are basically flying blind at the moment. There is no consistent data on what proportion of students are engaging in which modes of home-learning, or how this differs by postcode, or between primary and secondary schools. But we can be certain the status quo is exacerbating existing inequity. Students who are in high-socioeconomic areas with parents who can supervise them, with access to reliable and fast internet, and who go to tech-savvy schools, may not be substantially affected ‚Äî although no doubt they are learning less than they otherwise would. However, for students without these advantages, we are looking at up to six months of lost learning, unless our policy response becomes more effective. And we can‚Äôt naively assume that they will just catch up next year. There is a well-established phenomenon in education known as the ""Matthew effect"", which states that relatively small differences in ability in the early years of schooling grow into much larger differences by the end of school unless rectified. This is why effective early literacy and numeracy instruction is so important. It provides essential foundations for later learning. And it‚Äôs also why we should be most concerned about primary students in the coming months, who may take years to catch up with their peers again. Our most vulnerable children are disproportionately affected by school closures. But there are no equitable solutions other than completely re-opening the schools. In some countries like Spain all schools have closed, partly because it means all students will be equally affected. This is hardly a solution ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a warped logic that says harming disadvantaged students is fine so long as more advantaged students are harmed as well. Transitioning millions of students to online learning may be necessary now. But the research on education technology is inconsistent, and it‚Äôs not clear that it boosts student achievement even in the best of times. In the meantime, we should cut schools some slack. No one could reasonably expect a national transformation of schooling in a few weeks without some disruption. And teachers have generally been doing an amazing job; quickly becoming competent at education technology that is not particularly user-friendly. Nevertheless, when the next school term starts, we should expect school systems to be more organised, with improved communication and quality of educational resources available. And once schools re-open for all students, effective assessments should be carried out immediately to see which students have fallen behind the most. Evidence-based interventions should be used to help them and their progress should be tracked until they catch up. School systems should be preparing for this now. The inescapable conclusion is that schools need to go back to normal as soon as possible. While health experts and political considerations will differ on when exactly this should occur, the national cabinet must realise there is a substantial social cost for every day that students miss out on their normal progress.

He‚Äôs studying Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal, the series of public works projects in the United States between 1933 and 1939 established to get the country working after the Great Depression. FDR's Works Progress Association built more than 1 million kilometres of roads and more than 40,000 schools and hospitals across the nation. It gave 8.5 million unemployed people jobs. It also employed 40,000 artists, whose legacy lives on today, especially in my son‚Äôs city of birth, San Francisco. Giant murals of working people, which he remembers visiting many times as a young boy, stand like sentinels of hope wrought in the darkest of days. We‚Äôve sat together and listened to FDR‚Äôs fireside chats, impressed by his calm tone on the radio, especially his warnings to avoid the hysteria of hoarding. We‚Äôve compared and contrasted his style of leadership to those of today, and found four-time president Roosevelt, a man disabled by polio, stands the test of time. Will ours? Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Your parents have likely told you that 80 per cent of life is about showing up. I get that showing up is hard to a lonely computer screen (providing you are lucky enough to have one, and your school is delivering lessons online). I also believe 80 per cent of school is about learning to make friends. Social distancing from mates is really hard. We don‚Äôt know what shape this year's HSC will take. You may think if it goes ahead, that‚Äôs unfair. But life isn‚Äôt fair. Just keep calm and carry on, as that 1939 British wartime poster says. Hold the hysteria. And remember something I think of every time I shower with a loofah and scrub my skin hard to make it smooth. Tough times soften you ‚Äì they make you kinder. And this is the lesson you will get that no other cohort of Year 12 students has had before (our newspaper librarians tell me that no end-of-school exams were ever cancelled in NSW, even in the 1919 Spanish flu outbreak or either of the wars.) It‚Äôs called resilience. They don‚Äôt teach it in text books or end-of-year exams. You have to live it and you are doing that right now. You are making history, just like FDR and his New Deal. You are leaps and bounds ahead of any of us who have gone before. Whatever happens in your life, how you deal with adversity, or accomplishment, is up to you. Not your parents, not your teachers, just you. How you face this uncertainty will define you, for better or worse. Most of you are 18 or near to it. You are young adults ‚Äì so remember we are doing this to save lives. Try to imagine the pain of families who have lost loved ones to COVID-19, and you will know what it is to have empathy. Put your HSC texts aside and read Australian author Alan Marshall's 1955 autobiography I Can Jump Puddles,  about contracting polio soon after attending school and the obstacles he faced as a child trying to overcome his disability.

""Familiarity of routine is important to ease anxiety in these unprecedented times."" The school is operating its timetable ""virtually to the minute for our senior school boys, who attend six periods a day as if they would on campus"". Students take part in house meetings, daily tutor groups and assemblies via video conference. Other schools have tweaked their timetables, incorporating more time to stretch, get water and take a break from screens. Pittwater High has modified its timetable so the official school day finishes at 1.30pm, and students spend their afternoons reading, doing longer term assignments, or finishing off class work. Sir Joseph Banks High School has reduced the length of its periods to 30 minutes, with a 15-minute break between each lesson to reduce screen time. The class work is set, and the online tutorials are optional to lift the pressure for students to be in class for five hours every day. The Revesby school is also moving to a flexible attendance framework, in which student engagement is measured by whether they join lessons or hand in assignments over a week rather than an old-fashioned daily roll call. Most schools are using a combination of delivery methods. But at Meriden and MLC, for example, senior school classes are live and interactive. An MLC student in live discussions with her teacher. A Meriden year 10 food technology class has involved the teacher assessing ingredients in students' home kitchens and guiding them through making healthy snacks, while a year 7 science class tested the density of objects around the house. Other schools are leaning more heavily on offline learning, for both technology and pedagogical reasons. ""Many students are reporting slow internet speeds during school hours, so live streaming and video can be problematic,"" North Sydney Girls said in a statement. The selective girls' school is using a ""mixed delivery model"" that only requires one or two live sessions per subject in each timetable cycle.

International Education Association of Australia has called for a national hardship fund for foreign students, many who have lost their jobs as the pandemic ravages retail and hospitality. Colombian student Juan David Alarcon has lost both his jobs and is not sure how he will pay his rent.Credit:Justin McManus. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take $39 billion a year off those students and not expect to give something back in an unprecedented crisis such as this,"" chief executive Phil Honeywood said. ‚ÄúNot only do they pay expensive tuition fees and rent and spend on food and entertainment but we are also happy to use them as cannon fodder for many low-skilled and part time jobs that many Australians have resisted doing in the past. ""If we don‚Äôt do something for those in need now our reputation as a safe, welcoming, studying destination could be compromised for all time.‚Äù His call comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison told international students and other temporary visa holders to return to their home countries if they were unable to support themselves. Mr Morrison‚Äôs comments were echoed on Saturday by acting immigration minister Alan Tudge, who said it was time for such people to go home ‚Äúas quickly as possible‚Äù. The ‚Äúgo home‚Äù call has upset the education sector with universities and private colleges already reeling from a collapse in revenue, a situation likely to worsen later in the year when international students traditionally enrol in big numbers. On Saturday the government announced changes for the more than 2 million people on temporary visas in Australia (570,000 international students) including relaxation of work restrictions to boost numbers in industries critical in the pandemic, including aged care and nursing. Students who have been here longer than 12 months and in financial hardship will also be able to access any Australian superannuation they have. International students are not eligible for government welfare or for the new JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes. Many have lost their jobs and their homes, or live in fear of both, and of not being able to pay often expensive fees. Until a fortnight ago, Juan David Alarcon from Bogota, Colombia was working a total of 20 hours a week in two waiting jobs to help pay for his business diploma at a private college in Melbourne. He is now out of work. ‚ÄúThe most important question is, ‚Äòhow do I pay the rent?‚Äù he said. When Juan David explained his predicament to his real estate agent he was advised to seek help from Centrelink. He spent hours scouring the Centrelink website, only to discover he was not eligible for anything. Replay   Many international students say they are paying a premium for quality education that was supposed to be provided through classes and direct contact. But with classes suspended and studying made virtual, there has been no commensurate reduction in fees at most universities and colleges. Most major universities have announced some assistance including special loans, hardship funds, grocery vouchers and dedicated COVID-19 email and telephone hotlines. Few have reduced fees. Education Minister Dan Tehan said the government would work with universities and the international education sector to find ‚Äúinnovative ways to support international students.""

Colombian student Juan David Alarcon has lost both his jobs and is not sure how he will pay his rent.Credit:Justin McManus. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take $39 billion a year off those students and not expect to give something back in an unprecedented crisis such as this,"" chief executive Phil Honeywood said. ‚ÄúNot only do they pay expensive tuition fees and rent and spend on food and entertainment but we are also happy to use them as cannon fodder for many low-skilled and part time jobs that many Australians have resisted doing in the past. ""If we don‚Äôt do something for those in need now our reputation as a safe, welcoming, studying destination could be compromised for all time.‚Äù His call comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison told international students and other temporary visa holders to return to their home countries if they were unable to support themselves. Mr Morrison‚Äôs comments were echoed on Saturday by acting immigration minister Alan Tudge, who said it was time for such people to go home ‚Äúas quickly as possible‚Äù. The ‚Äúgo home‚Äù call has upset the education sector with universities and private colleges already reeling from a collapse in revenue, a situation likely to worsen later in the year when international students traditionally enrol in big numbers. On Saturday the government announced changes for the more than 2 million people on temporary visas in Australia (570,000 international students) including relaxation of work restrictions to boost numbers in industries critical in the pandemic, including aged care and nursing. Students who have been here longer than 12 months and in financial hardship will also be able to access any Australian superannuation they have. International students are not eligible for government welfare or for the new JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes. Many have lost their jobs and their homes, or live in fear of both, and of not being able to pay often expensive fees. Until a fortnight ago, Juan David Alarcon from Bogota, Colombia was working a total of 20 hours a week in two waiting jobs to help pay for his business diploma at a private college in Melbourne. He is now out of work. ‚ÄúThe most important question is, ‚Äòhow do I pay the rent?‚Äù he said. When Juan David explained his predicament to his real estate agent he was advised to seek help from Centrelink. He spent hours scouring the Centrelink website, only to discover he was not eligible for anything. Replay   Many international students say they are paying a premium for quality education that was supposed to be provided through classes and direct contact. But with classes suspended and studying made virtual, there has been no commensurate reduction in fees at most universities and colleges. Most major universities have announced some assistance including special loans, hardship funds, grocery vouchers and dedicated COVID-19 email and telephone hotlines. Few have reduced fees. Education Minister Dan Tehan said the government would work with universities and the international education sector to find ‚Äúinnovative ways to support international students.""

He also indicated that funding hurdles for universities - which emphasise graduate employment outcomes - may be waived on account of the unprecedented global pandemic. Education Minister Dan Tehan has moved to assure students about their future.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen Mr Tehan said state and territory authorities will need to alter their approach to assessments and the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank ""to enable year 12 students to ... acquire some sort of a leaving certificate"" to protect pathways into tertiary education, vocational training and work. He also acknowledged it was possible demand for university would spike due to the lacklustre jobs market and the government would look at any extra support required by the sector. He said there might be a need to ""reassess"" the ordinary funding rules for universities. The aim was to set a nationally co-ordinated pathway for school leavers into universities, he said. ""That is the definite aim that all education ministers are working towards. We want to see ... if we can get a nationally-consistent outcome."" Some universities have begun to make changes to admissions processes, including considering students based on year 11 results and special tests. Securing pathways for school leavers is the next priority for education ministers after the federal government unveiled a major childcare rescue package. The Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres, the federal body representing state admissions authorities, said on Friday all centres were committed to protecting access to further studies even in ""extraordinary"" times. ""The ATAR is a rank, not a score, so any changes to assessment processes in individual states will not affect the validity of the ATAR as a tool for tertiary admissions,"" it said in a statement. Acknowledging concerns this year's disruption to schooling will deny students critical knowledge needed to take on university study, Mr Tehan said schools would work ""as hard as possible"" to provide adequate teaching. But he said universities might also have to adapt first-year to equip students with any additional knowledge. ""My view is that the combination between what education students get in year 12 and then what they will be able to get in that first year of university will have students ready for second year with the knowledge that they need,"" Mr Tehan said. He said it was possible demand for university will spike next year, partly because people are seeking to study or retrain in a weak economy with high unemployment. ""At the moment, we think there's additional capacity in the system for if there was extra enrolments but we are absolutely committed to working with them to see ... how we would go about providing the support that would be needed,"" he said. To unlock funding increases, universities currently face performance measures that emphasise graduate employment outcomes. Mr Tehan said the government was talking to the sector about possible changes. ""Obviously, when you're faced with a pandemic, the likes of which we're faced with now, there is a need to reassess some of the regulatory requirements that you have in place,"" he said. Replay   The Australian National University's higher education researcher Andrew Norton said demand for tertiary places in 2021 could be much higher than previously anticipated because of deferrals from 2020 and poor employment prospects. Professor Norton said universities would have spare capacity because of lower international student numbers, ""but due to current public funding caps universities may have to reduce offer rates to avoid taking students they cannot afford to teach"". The chair of the NSW Education Standards Authority, Peter Shergold, said the key message in his state was that the HSC would go ahead. ""We will change some of the arrangements, learning will be different, but we will inform school authorities and school principals of increased flexibility this year, to ensure all students in safety can make sure they can gain their HSC,"" he said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino promised this week that all Victorian year 12 students would ""complete their studies"" and said the government was working on options, including adaptation to online learning, delayed assessments and exams and extra support.

The industry feeds international students into universities and vocational training colleges. David Scott, the managing director of  the English Language Company, thinks a lot of schools will face extinction very quickly unless something is done. Credit:Rhett Wyman David Scott, managing director of the English Language Company in Sydney has 280 overseas students working from home online and whose visas will expire within six months. ""Our business is about people coming into the country so, with the borders closed, there is no ongoing revenue for six months,"" he said. ""We still have the expense of paying teachers and staff to manage these students. ""When you have a big school with rent and staff that you have to keep paying but your revenue is gone then you are one of the first to suffer badly. I think a lot of schools will face extinction very quickly unless something is done,"" he said. Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, described the sector as the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the $40 billion international education industry because it was an entry point into tertiary institutions. Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia,¬†says the sector is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the $40 billion international education industry.Credit:Attila Csaszar ""Unlike any other business, their customers cannot get into the country,"" he said. English language colleges are totally reliant on the flow of foreign students coming on a regular basis, he said. ""When their student numbers drop dramatically, TAFE, universities and other providers all know they will be impacted in the subsequent pipeline of students."" Brett Blacker, chief executive officer of English Australia, the peak national group representing about 120 businesses, said some had already closed and others were on the brink of collapse because their revenue depended on a constant flow of international student arrivals. ""We rely 100 per cent on foreign nationals and, since borders closed on March 20, no new business can come in,"" he said. ""For the last two weeks owners have been scrambling with cash flow issues and ongoing costs in teacher salaries and overheads in transitioning to online study. We have a huge number of providers just scrambling to survive."" While the federal government's announcement of the new JobKeeper package this week was a welcome reprieve for the operators and 10,000 teachers on their payrolls, some had already been forced to close. Larger operators were ""on the brink"" of closure. The JobKeeper wage subsidy gives six million workers a flat payment of $1,500 per fortnight via their employer. Mr Blacker said that once closed colleges, including some that had been running for more than 20 years, would find it difficult to restart their businesses. ""The payroll is one element, but it is not going to fix everything,"" Mr Blacker said. ""Prior to this we were the third largest sourced destination for English students globally."" Mr Scott said the JobKeeper package would help schools manage staff costs. Schools including his would try to survive by going into hibernation, but he feared that many forced to close would be unable to recover. He said the sector was ""at grave threat"". ""We need to hang on,"" he said. ""We are the feeder to all international education in Australia - all the universities and other colleges. If the industry dies, which it is at danger of at the moment, all that is gone."" John Paxton, the director and owner of Perth International College of English said that, up until two weeks ago, he was receiving six to 10 new overseas students for English tuition each Monday. He said his industry needed government-sponsored interest free loans to see it out until international students could return. ""We don't have any revenue at all,"" he said. ""It disappeared overnight"". ""About 30 per cent of my students are learning English to go to Vocational Education and Training courses, TAFE and higher education. The English language sector is heading to the abyss very quickly. We don't have any prospect of getting any new business for the next six months."" The Australian Skills Quality Authority, which regulates the vocational education and training sector, said it was committed to helping colleges minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students, staff and their operations. ""Our focus has been on reducing the regulatory burden and working flexibly with the sector to maintain quality of training and assessment and to provide assurance of the outcomes of competency,"" a spokesman said. The measures it has taken include extending some registration periods or putting them temporarily on hold to relieve the pressure of upcoming renewal applications. Deadlines for annual reporting requirements have been extended and other regulation activity postponed.

""We still have the expense of paying teachers and staff to manage these students. ""When you have a big school with rent and staff that you have to keep paying but your revenue is gone then you are one of the first to suffer badly. I think a lot of schools will face extinction very quickly unless something is done,"" he said. Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, described the sector as the ""canary in the coal mine"" for the $40 billion international education industry because it was an entry point into tertiary institutions.

English language colleges are totally reliant on the flow of foreign students coming on a regular basis, he said. ""When their student numbers drop dramatically, TAFE, universities and other providers all know they will be impacted in the subsequent pipeline of students."" Brett Blacker, chief executive officer of English Australia, the peak national group representing about 120 businesses, said some had already closed and others were on the brink of collapse because their revenue depended on a constant flow of international student arrivals. ""We rely 100 per cent on foreign nationals and, since borders closed on March 20, no new business can come in,"" he said. ""For the last two weeks owners have been scrambling with cash flow issues and ongoing costs in teacher salaries and overheads in transitioning to online study. We have a huge number of providers just scrambling to survive."" While the federal government's announcement of the new JobKeeper package this week was a welcome reprieve for the operators and 10,000 teachers on their payrolls, some had already been forced to close. Larger operators were ""on the brink"" of closure. The JobKeeper wage subsidy gives six million workers a flat payment of $1,500 per fortnight via their employer. Mr Blacker said that once closed colleges, including some that had been running for more than 20 years, would find it difficult to restart their businesses. ""The payroll is one element, but it is not going to fix everything,"" Mr Blacker said. ""Prior to this we were the third largest sourced destination for English students globally."" Mr Scott said the JobKeeper package would help schools manage staff costs. Schools including his would try to survive by going into hibernation, but he feared that many forced to close would be unable to recover. He said the sector was ""at grave threat"". ""We need to hang on,"" he said. ""We are the feeder to all international education in Australia - all the universities and other colleges. If the industry dies, which it is at danger of at the moment, all that is gone."" John Paxton, the director and owner of Perth International College of English said that, up until two weeks ago, he was receiving six to 10 new overseas students for English tuition each Monday. He said his industry needed government-sponsored interest free loans to see it out until international students could return. ""We don't have any revenue at all,"" he said. ""It disappeared overnight"". ""About 30 per cent of my students are learning English to go to Vocational Education and Training courses, TAFE and higher education. The English language sector is heading to the abyss very quickly. We don't have any prospect of getting any new business for the next six months."" The Australian Skills Quality Authority, which regulates the vocational education and training sector, said it was committed to helping colleges minimise the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students, staff and their operations. ""Our focus has been on reducing the regulatory burden and working flexibly with the sector to maintain quality of training and assessment and to provide assurance of the outcomes of competency,"" a spokesman said. The measures it has taken include extending some registration periods or putting them temporarily on hold to relieve the pressure of upcoming renewal applications. Deadlines for annual reporting requirements have been extended and other regulation activity postponed.

Sarah Mitchell's comments come as education experts said trying to replicate a full school day at home could be counterproductive for younger students, and a few hours worth of maths and literacy was sufficient. Experts say parents of younger students do not need to replicate the full school day at home Credit: Supplied Working parents of primary school-aged children say they are feeling overwhelmed by the need to supervise six hours' worth of remote schooling while trying to hold down increasingly vulnerable jobs. Ms Mitchell, who has a student in year 1, said she understood the pressure of balancing remote lessons with work. ""I want to say to parents and carers, please don‚Äôt expect too much from yourself,"" she said. ""Sometimes you will only complete a small part of the day's plan, and that's OK. For primary aged students literacy and numeracy are key focus areas. If you‚Äôre finding the workload or expectations too onerous, please speak to your school."" Tom Alegounarias, the former chairman of the NSW Education Standards Authority, said it was not only impossible, but also counterproductive to try to replicate the institutionalised structure of school at home. Replay   ""It isn't appropriate to be structured in concentrated and engaged learning all day [at home],"" he said. ""That isn't actually what happens at school. Kids don't remain in this focused state for long periods."" Mr Alegounarias said learning could be divided into fundamental skills, such as writing, or mathematics, and broader essential knowledge that is more difficult to define, such as history or social issues. When deciding what to do at home, Mr Alegounarias suggested parents focus on building ""operational"" knowledge such as multiplication or spelling, and practising those fundamental literacy and maths skills. ""It's important to spend some time in a less structured way, to practise those capacities, reading, writing, and some maths,"" he said. But children can develop the broader knowledge by watching historical movies, or discussing an idea over dinner, or listening to podcasts. ""It still counts as learning, just as it does at school,"" he said. Sandra Saunders, who has been teaching her own children for eight years, said teaching at home was very different from school, and the bulk of the day's lessons could be done within 2¬Ω hours. ""[At school], a lot of time is taken up dealing with noisy students, answering individual questions and similar,"" she said. ""The environment [at home] is completely different. Six hours of school in these current circumstances [is] impossible and unnecessary. ""I think it would be sufficient for lower primary school kids to do a bit of maths, reading and writing, and then have some fun."" Primary Principals Association president Phil Seymour acknowledged the task was more difficult for families with younger children. He urged parents to avoid putting too much pressure on themselves or their children. Those who were time-poor should stick to the basics, and take advantage of the mornings, when children were most alert. ""I would certainly say reading, and some activities around reading,"" he said. ""Some writing would be fabulous, and some basic maths. If you can fit it in, some creative stuff. If that is all you do, that's all you do."" Pasi Sahlberg, author of Let the Children Play, said responsibility for teaching remained with schools in a remote learning situation, unlike home schooling. ""It's very important that we all agree that we cannot expect from ourselves or one another the same things as a normal situation.""

Some have called on the NSW Department of Education to ask schools to clarify which lessons are essential and which are optional, saying they do not have the capacity to work, worry about money and supervise six hours of lessons a day. Parents are struggling under the stress of running home lessons.Credit:Ben Long Schools are now running remote lessons for more than 90 per cent of NSW students due to the COVID-19 crisis, a situation likely to last for months. The NSW Department of Education says the lessons are designed to be done without parental involvement. But many parents say the lessons do require hours worth of intensive supervision, particularly if their child is in early primary school, struggles to focus or get motivated, or has special needs. Sydney mother Jessica Stannard has an eight-year-old with special needs and a six year old, and has had to move back in with her ex-husband so both adults can juggle their jobs while looking after the children. ""It is completely untenable,"" she said. ""I am absolutely overwhelmed."" One parent said she spent the week working at her job, then the weekend catching up on all the work her children had missed, doing chores at night. Another single mother wakes at 3am to do her paid work so she can supervise her children during the day. Alexander, 10, and Elizabeth, 8, do their lessons at home during the coronavirus crisis. Their mum, Yvette McDonald, says there is too much pressure on already-stressed parents. ""Do they understand that parents are fighting for our lives, our jobs, and our companies as well?"" another parent said. ""I'm a working mum. If I don't do my job, I may lose it. I know things had to be done in a hurry. But parents have been thrown in the deep end."" Yvette McDonald, from the inner west, has two young children at a public primary school, which issues written lessons and requires typed, online communication, such as being present for roll call at the beginning and end of each day. She has asked the NSW Department of Education to relax those rules, saying they were unworkable. ""Parents are already at breaking point and we haven't even gone into formal lockdown,"" she said. ""Many of us are managing crisis at work, but then on top of that we're schooling our children as well. We feel as though we're failing, but we're not failing - we've been asked to do impossible things. We want to know what's essential and what's not."" The former chair of the NSW Education Standards Authority, Tom Alegounarias, said the COVID-19 crisis would force educators to grapple with an issue they have not needed to face before; what learning was essential in the short term, and what could be left until later. ""I would say [for younger children, parents should] focus on the learning mechanics that are essential for subsequent learning [such as maths, reading and writing], and for older kids, building and practising the capacities that will make them more confident learners,"" he said. Education Minister Sarah Mitchell thanked parents for their efforts, and encouraged flexibility and understanding on all sides. ""School will look different this year,"" she said. ""It is important we recognise that and work together to balance home, work and school life."" A spokesman for the department said parents should contact the school if they were grappling with the requirements. ""Learning from home is new for the vast majority of parents, students and teachers, and it will be a challenge to adapt,"" he said. There are increasing calls for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to offer educational programming, to ensure teaching can still reach students without internet access. A spokesman for the ABC said the organisation was ""exploring options to expand [existing education] services across multiple platforms to meet the needs of all students, teachers and parents and will engage with all states and territories if required.""

54,/national/a-learning-revolution-in-the-classroom-i-don-t-think-so-20200330-p54f76.html,A learning revolution in the classroom? I don't think so,"These are interesting times for those of us in education, as we have moved, over the past few weeks, to an at-home learning environment. While the situation with coronavirus has made this a necessity, it has also given us the opportunity to see what benefits technology and online learning can bring to students, and what the shortcomings are. Some claim that it will help us to revolutionise pedagogy and show how to ""rethink learning"". To the extent that this could be regarded as a social experiment in re-envisaging education, it has taught us many lessons. First, I want to say what a sterling job teachers have done ‚Äì right across the state. Their care for their students has been exemplary, their creativity to develop innovative lessons has been amazing, and they all deserve our greatest congratulations and encouragement. I have never been prouder to say I am a teacher. The coronavirus crisis has only made the power of face-to-face teaching more obvious. However, there are some deficiencies which wonderful online teaching will never be able to fully overcome. Teachers are reporting that it is harder to engage some students when they are learning online. Many students were at first enticed by the novelty of online and at-home learning, and it seemed interesting. Novelty always engages and entices young people! But, slowly, this is dissolving for some students, and will for other students over time. It becomes boring. It becomes harder. It becomes lonely. It becomes less engaging. It‚Äôs not easy learning alone from a screen, even with a fantastic teacher at the other end. The very best students will manage that for a time. Many feel disengaged after a while. Distractions rise to the surface ‚Äì playing computer games, checking social media, sleeping, playing with pets or siblings, doing nothing. Or, they continue to try to learn, but it just becomes harder, more draining, less affirming. It‚Äôs harder for teachers to monitor what students are doing. It‚Äôs hard to encourage kids when they are ready to switch off because it isn‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs harder to motivate and engage and encourage and inspire. Teachers are struggling too! It‚Äôs also harder to help students feel connected and have a sense of belonging. Connectedness has always been one of the most protective factors for young people‚Äôs mental health. It‚Äôs harder for a young person to feel they really belong when they aren‚Äôt physically connected and engaged with a group of people. Students feel less involved, less important, less needed, when they represent just one image on a screen with 20 or so other students. It‚Äôs lonely! Class could easily go on without them. They don‚Äôt need to take a more active role. And it‚Äôs harder for teachers to monitor young people‚Äôs mental health and wellbeing. This mental health issue is, I think, absolutely critical as we contemplate longer term online learning. It‚Äôs harder to be involved in music, artmaking, drama and dance performances, design works, sport PE and fitness, and so on. Of course, some activities are possible, but these are a poor substitute for the real thing ‚Äì working in groups or working with the full range of materials and equipment. And these practical subjects are really important for us if we are to have a thriving, educated, cultured, sophisticated society. We are social beings, and we need others to help us to learn and grow, to feel connected, to feel good about ourselves. And children more so than adults. Interacting on the screen isn‚Äôt the same. We crave personal communication, physical contact, shared laughter, warm encouragement. Social interaction helps us to learn. So, when we are through the pandemic, I think we will return to classes as usual. The current situation has taught us that there is nothing like a great teacher physically in front of a class. Nothing about what we are doing currently is as good as what we were doing a few weeks ago. Technology will play its part, and we will get better at using it for learning as one tool of many. And we will learn more about great pedagogy every day too. But a revolution? It isn‚Äôt. Now more than ever, we have demonstrated the power of great teachers and great teaching, in classrooms, face to face, every day. Jenny Allum is head of SCEGGS Darlinghurst.

Former Templestowe College principal Peter Hutton has petitioned for the ATAR to be scrapped this year.Credit:Eddie Jim The petition was started by former Templestowe College principal Peter Hutton, who says it is unfair to rank students against each other during the COVID-19 crisis. ‚ÄúWhat better time to kill the ATAR off than now, when an already demonstrably inequitable system is made even more so due to disruption, remote schooling and inequality of technology provision in online learning,‚Äù he writes in the change.org petition, which had almost 10,300 signatures by 9pm on Monday. Among the signatories to the petition is Zac Jeffries, the director of teaching and learning at Bayview College, an independent school in Portland, south-western Victoria. Mr Jeffries said Bayview College had already experienced a rise in the number of VCE students choosing to complete their VCE unscored, often as a way to manage their anxieties.  Credit:Marina Neil ‚ÄúThe number of students that need help for anxiety has really gone up in the last few years,‚Äù Mr Jeffries said. ‚ÄúA lot of those students are the ones that move towards doing an unscored VCE.‚Äù When Mr Hutton was principal at Templestowe College, he would routinely encourage VCE students to forget about trying to get a good ATAR, the four-digit ranking that is used to set the bar for entry to most university courses. Determined to ‚Äúflip‚Äù the method for measuring academic success, he pushed students at the government school in Melbourne‚Äôs east to complete their VCE unscored and skip the stress of exams. ‚ÄúWe said to students, you will start off with an unscored VCE, unless you choose to do a scored assessment,‚Äù Mr Hutton says. Templestowe College flipped its own fortunes, growing from a dying state school with fewer than 300 students 10 years ago to one with almost 1400 last year. Data released to The Age by the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority reveals there was an extraordinary leap in the number of students who completed their VCE unscored last year: from 2072 students in 2018 to a record 3810 students, or 7.7 per cent of all students who graduated. Not all students who take this path are doing so to avoid the anxiety of exams or of being ranked against their peers. Lian Davies, principal of Whittlesea Secondary College, said that although most students at the school graduate with an ATAR, the option not to do so is gaining favour, simply because of growing awareness among students and parents that not all VCE graduates need the ranking to get ahead. This includes students who go on to apprenticeships, TAFE and even university, with some tertiary institutions offering alternative paths to entry for those who do not have an ATAR. Replay   ‚ÄúThere is increased awareness and support from parents who understand that, all right, it‚Äôs not all about this ATAR number; it‚Äôs genuinely about getting where they want to go and there and multiple ways to do it,‚Äù Ms Davies said. A spokesperson for the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority said undertaking VCE without study scores was a valid and desirable option for some students, and one that also enables schools to better cater for the needs of individual students. ‚ÄúThis includes students who do not require a study score for tertiary admission, and have chosen alternative pathways such as TAFE or to take up offers of employment,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

His comments came as the country's education ministers discussed changes to the way the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank could be calculated and presented, amid uncertainty about whether year 12 exams will still go ahead this year. Across NSW, about 90 per cent of public school students are doing their lessons off campus after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, last week called on parents to keep students at home if possible for the rest of the term, and teachers scrambled to prepare remote lessons. The forced shift to remote learning could have major implications for the way students learn once the COVID-19 crisis is over.Credit:iStock It is unclear whether that system will continue when term two resumes in NSW in late April, or if there will be further closures because transmission of the virus is more widespread. Other states are now following the NSW remote schooling model. Mr Scott said the department's learning from home hub has had more than 300,000 individual users, attracting interest across sectors, interstate and in English-speaking countries overseas. The work was intended for students to do without parental supervision. ""The work that is being sent home does need to be done, but is not designed that it can only be done if the parent is standing at the shoulder of the children,"" he said. Teachers were being encouraged to engage with students as well as teach them from afar, and to be ""very conscious of students who they aren't hearing from as much as they should be,"" Mr Scott said. Mr Scott acknowledged that 2020 ""will be the most disruptive year of learning in several generations"". ""When students get back [to school], we will have to be thinking very carefully through how we then assess where they are up to in their learning, and how we can pick them up from where they are. Good teachers will be continuing to assess student learning while they're away."" But education leaders were already looking at what could be learned from the experience, especially in relation to technology and independent learning. ""We are going to see and think carefully through how students can learn on their own, and how in future we could encourage students to learn on their own,"" Mr Scott said. ""I think this will revolutionise the thinking around homework in years to come. We will understand far better how students can learn on their own, and what they learn best on their own, we [will be] rethinking the classroom experience. ""We knew that technology had the capacity to revolutionise how learning can take place, we are now learning that in real time."" One private school principal went further.

Even though the country's top medical experts were insisting it was safe for schools to remain open, and closing them might make the spread of COVID-19 worse, these wealthy schools had the means to run lessons online. They decided to do it. Within hours, word of the plan reached Mark Scott, head of the NSW Department of Education. He was worried. Private schools can do whatever they want, but their decisions put enormous pressure on other systems to follow suit, including the state's 2200 public schools. The NSW government's response was being led by health experts, but the breakaway group's move meant a decision with vast implications for the state could be driven by half a dozen self-interested private schools. Replay   ""The [department's view was that the] stance we took would be perceived by a significant portion of the community as the gold standard,"" one principal said. ""It would play into the class warfare narrative: rich kids looked after while poor kids will be catching diseases."" Scott rang Geoff Newcombe, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Schools NSW. The relationship between the independent, Catholic and public sectors can be fraught at the best of times, but Scott has known Newcombe for years, and Newcombe quickly understood the problem. Newcombe rounded up 30 principals from some of the state's most influential independent schools for a conference call that evening with the NSW Chief Health Officer, Dr Kerry Chant, and the state's education and health ministers. It included heads of schools such as MLC, Newington, Kambala, Shore and Cranbrook, and was chaired by Scott. ""Mark [Scott] doesn't stand over the independent sector,"" one principal said. ""Just that fact [that he organised it] meant it was clear that what we do will have massive implications for the whole sphere of school education."" Mark Scott.Credit:Janie Barrett The government ministers contributed little. ""They just said, 'please listen',"" recalls one of the participants. Chant explained how medical experts had arrived at the decision that schools should remain open, at least for now. She was compelling. ""I took it as a pitch to our civic duty,"" one principal said. ""A recognition that we had the autonomy to make our own call, but to be aware that the call we made had implications well beyond our own borders too."" The principals asked questions. And they told Chant that, from their perspective, the biggest risk to the cohesion of their school communities ‚Äì and their own leadership on COVID-19 ‚Äì was parents who were medical professionals, but neither pandemic experts nor privy to the full picture of information on which decisions were based. They were demanding health authorities change their course of action, creating panic and uncertainty within their parent bodies. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (right) and NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant (left).Credit:AAP ""Experts did their modelling based on facts and what we know about how pandemics spread in different conditions,"" one of those on the call told the Herald. ""But the thing that modelling has not accounted for is fear."" They also told the ministers that they could do classroom learning, or online learning, but not both. The following day, the heads contacted their school communities to tell them about Chant's advice and explain why they had chosen to stay open. While many Victorian schools rushed to close their doors, few in NSW followed, due to that Sunday night call. ""Whatever my own views on the topic are, I believe we are in a time where listening to one considered voice is important,"" Reddam House co-principal Dee Pitcairn wrote in a letter to parents. ""For me, those are the voices of Scott Morrison and [Chief Health Officer] Brendan Murphy."" Most of those that did close in NSW were smaller schools, such as a Buddhist school in Parramatta and Alpha Omega College. Pymble Ladies College was the largest to break ranks, running an online program while keeping its campus open for students who had to attend. PLC's decision angered many independent school heads, who felt it had acted in its own interests rather than for the collective. The consensus was threatened again days later when, on the Wednesday, NSW Catholic systemic schools signalled they would close their physical campuses and begin online learning, taking several Catholic independent schools with them. Association of Independent Schools of NSW chief executive Geoff Newcombe. That drew more significant intervention; the next morning Prime Minister Scott Morrison telephoned Sydney's Catholic Archbishop, Anthony Fisher, who then wrote to Catholic bishops and school leaders insisting they follow federal government advice and remain open. In calls to both Catholic and independent sector leaders, Morrison mentioned that the federal government paid their bills. It was a veiled threat: toe the line or risk your funding. Through a mixture of persuasion, threat and leadership, the three school sectors managed by the end of that third week in March what so many have accused them of failing to achieve in the past ‚Äì unity. But while non-government leaders were persuaded to follow a single message from the nation's top health experts, pressure was mounting on the government elsewhere. Teachers were becoming increasingly anxious about their own health, especially as many in the public system did not have access to the protective measures that private schools were able to summon quickly, such as extra sanitiser stations; some did not even have soap and were running out of paper towels and toilet paper. They were also increasingly resentful about one of the key messages coming out of governments: that schools had to stay open to look after the children of healthcare workers, who were doing an important job. By implication, a teacher's job was not important; they were being asked to self-sacrifice too, with no acknowledgment. One senior education bureaucrat believed authorities blew their chance to get teachers onside from the beginning. ""They should have said thank you. It quickly became too late."" For a workforce that has had its goodwill eroded by ever-increasing levels of disrespect from the wider community over many years, it was hard to swallow. ""I hate that we are being sacrificed to keep nurses working,"" one teacher said. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, national Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on March 13.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer By the end of that week, teachers unions from the public and private sectors were stepping up their pressure on governments, particularly the NSW government, to create a situation in which teachers, especially older and vulnerable ones, could work from home, as everyone else was being told to do. In the end, it was Premier Gladys Berejiklian who made the call to effectively shut schools. Her government was worried. There was the Ruby Princess debacle, in which cruise passengers with COVID-19 were allowed to disembark and wander unchecked into the community. Thousands of people gathered at Bondi Beach on a 35 degree day, ignoring social distancing advice. Pressure from teachers was intensifying, although there was no direct threat of industrial action. Then, last Sunday morning, Victoria announced it would bring school holidays ‚Äì which were due two weeks earlier than in NSW ‚Äì forward. With NSW becoming the country's coronavirus epicentre, Berejiklian decided to move. At the urging of the NSW and Victorian premiers, national cabinet was brought forward to last Sunday night. On the question of school closures, Morrison could not be persuaded; as long as the medical experts said it was safe, schools should remain open. So Berejiklian settled on a position that would not directly flout the authority of the national cabinet, but still achieve what she wanted; schools would technically be open, but parents were urged to keep students at home and all learning would be done online. Her public reasoning was that schools might as well go online, given a quarter of parents were already keeping their children home. Within days of the Premier's announcement, absentee rates reached almost 90 per cent. ""What Gladys could not achieve by way of a policy, she got by persuasion,"" an education executive close to the negotiations said. ""They have a view inside NSW cabinet that the national response is lagging. But if you identified the messiest part of the [COVID-19 response], it's around schools. The ambiguity has been allowed to linger too long."" Replay   For now, schools remain open to those who have no option but to send their children, but fewer and fewer are attending each day. The NSW Teachers Federation wants a bigger shutdown so that only children of frontline healthcare workers may attend. The Prime Minister, who tried so hard to keep schools open, has now acknowledged they are likely to shut after Easter. Many teachers were relieved by the NSW government's response, worried about their own health and those they love. So were many parents, who gained the go-ahead to keep their kids at home. Many frontline health workers believe it was the right decision to stop the spread of the disease. But some families have also been thrust into financial hardship by the pressure to choose between looking after their children and their jobs, as industries continue to shut down with no sign of reopening and job losses continue. Many are also worried about how they will sustain working and home-schooling for six months. There is also deep concern about how the state's most vulnerable students will be affected not only by a potential pause in learning, if they have neither the technology nor the support at home, but also by the loss of the care and safety they find at school. Berejiklian's decision scotched cross-sector co-operation. Despite her bureaucrats and ministers having gone to great lengths to explain the strong reasons to keep schools open and to convince the non-government sector to stay on a single, scientifically based message one week, she abandoned it the next. Some of the private school principals who rallied after the phone hook-up are angry. ""I had staked so much of the school's position on the fact we would follow the advice of the NSW Chief Medical Officer,"" one said. ""Then we had what was, by my understanding, a political decision."" Another felt betrayed. ""I don't understand how anybody can say, 'I note that the medical advice is this, but we're going to do something different'. How is that leadership? You can't expect loyalty then not show loyalty in return. I can no longer rely on health advice, because people keep changing their minds about what they do with it.

A 22-member team from the Group of Eight universities called for a rapid, sweeping and costly lockdown to pave the way for a national recovery once the crisis abates, having been convened following a request from Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy. Senior medical academic Shitij Kapur says government decision makers face a complex and unprecedented task.  The government has been criticised for resisting the more hardline lockdown and on Tuesday Professor Murphy said the Group of Eight advice was ""very seriously considered"" but noted the conclusions were not unanimous and the government wanted measures that would be sustainable long-term. He said ""harder measures"" might be required if community transmission increased. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country was facing both health and economic crises and cautioned against rushing into hardline measures because of the potentially ""great toll on people's lives, not just their livelihoods"". Shitij Kapur, dean of medicine at the University of Melbourne, praised the government for seeking a range of expert opinions and said advice on ""very complex, unprecedented circumstances is not black and white"", which was why the group he chaired had canvassed a diversity of views on how to escalate social distancing measures. ""We have to all humbly recognise that we don't know the perfect answer and people who have to reduce all the advice into an actionable decision have a very tough task to do,"" he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. ""I feel that our job is to give them the evidence and then we have to trust them to make the right decision."" He said it was easy to offer advice as an academic but those in power had to weigh up a complex mix of medical, scientific, economic and social factors. He also noted the situation was evolving ""dramatically"" and had changed even as the expert group developed their recommendations from late last week until Sunday.  Professor Kapur said people could not be complacent and he was comfortable with a much stronger lockdown but it should also be recognised that Australia was showing low infection rates, high testing rates, low fatality rates and still relatively few cases from local community transition. ""We should in no way be complacent but I don't think we should throw stones at a system that has managed to achieve these statistics,"" he said. The expert group's final advice ‚Äì revealed by the Herald and the Age ‚Äì recommended ""strong, immediate and coordinated social distancing measures, accompanied by an enhanced COVID-19 testing regime"". The shutdown would include ""more extensive banning of mass gatherings, school closure or class dismissal"". A minority of the group had advocated for a more localised and phased approach, based on the spread of COVID-19 in different areas, with more limited school closures. Replay   University of Melbourne computational modeller Nic Geard, who was part of the expert group, said the modelling of the pandemic was evolving and there was still significant uncertainty. ""As scientists we accept that we start off with a lot of uncertainty. We can pass on advice and communicate that uncertainty to the decision makers,"" he said. UNSW epidemiologist Margo Barr, also part of the group, praised the government's escalating public communications campaign on the COVID-19 response and welcomed Professor Murphy's emphasis on the importance of complying with self-isolation and social distancing advice. ""Simple messaging is important but people also want honesty about what's happening and how difficult it's going to be,"" she said.

School funding experts say there is no historical precedent to suggest how hard the financial downturn caused by the coronavirus crisis will hit the non-government school sector. NSW independent schools believe the impact from the financial crisis could be ""significant"".Credit:Erin Jonasson ""This is territory we haven't been into before,"" education researcher Chris Bonnor said. The Association of Independent Schools of NSW has said many private schools could be vulnerable by Easter and might need government help, angering public school advocates who say private schools already get more than their share of public funding. Association of Independent Schools of NSW chief executive Geoff Newcombe. AIS chief executive Geoff Newcombe said on Wednesday that the independent sector had been struggling under the impact of bushfires, drought and COVID-19, and was looking at ways to support parents and schools. ""This could include bringing forward the scheduled government recurrent payment to all schools due in July and possibly the October instalment. We are having discussions with the federal Department of Education and the government,"" he said. Independent schools receive their recurrent government funding in three instalments, with half in February, a quarter in July and a quarter in October. The head of the NSW Parents' Council, Rose Cantali, said most parents had not reckoned with the financial implications of the coronavirus shutdown yet, as the situation was changing so rapidly. Parents were not yet complaining about having to pay full fees for remote learning, and she believed those who could pay would be willing to do so if the online service was helping their children achieve academically. ""Schools have got overheads and commitments; they still have to pay the teachers,"" she said. However, Dr Cantali predicted many families would face financial hardship in coming months, as businesses were forced to close and job losses continued. ""There will be a lot of families approaching schools for some relief,"" she said. ""Depending on how long this is going to go on for, and depending on the situation with their mortgages, I think you'll find some parents who will eventually have no choice but to pull [their children] out."" One private school principal, who did not want to be named, said most parents had paid their term one fees, but some might struggle to pay for term two. Schools had payment plans for families in distress, but, he said, ""How far in debt do you want families to go? ""It takes a lot to make a parent change a school, and changing schools during remote learning would be particularly difficult. I don't see a big exodus during the year, but it could come at the end of the year. The impact really could be substantial."" A recent paper by Mr Bonnor argued it would only cost an extra $1 billion a year for the public sector to educate all the students at non-government schools, although the capital costs of buying and expanding schools would be greater. Private schools are not discounting fees due to the COVID-19 crisis, but some, such as International Grammar, have asked parents to contact them if they have serious financial concerns. ""We are aware that the COVID-19 situation is already causing financial hardship for some of our families,"" the school said in a letter to parents.

Since then, the Melbourne mother has downloaded educational apps, organised FaceTime reading sessions with grandparents and set up tutoring with a high school student neighbour. The local school has also been sending home extra readers, a blank scrap book and lined paper, but so far, there is little information about what the rest of the school year will look like. Kimberley Knapp¬†took her 5-year-old daughters Isla and Millie out of school indefinitely due to coronavirus fears.Credit:Joe Armao ""People are confused, it's all very scary,"" Ms Knapp said, wondering if her daughters, who are young for their year, will end up repeating next year. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been at pains to say he wants ""children get taught"" amid all the disruption due to coronavirus, and that the medical advice states it is safe for kids to go to school. ""It's going to be a tough year in 2020 and one of the things I don't want to have yielded up is a year of a child's education, which is so important,"" he told reporters on Tuesday night, adding teachers were now working on ""extending distance learning"". Nevertheless, the school year is already looking radically different. This week, Victoria brought forward its Easter holidays, NSW encouraged parents to keep children at home and ACT schools went online. Many private schools have also closed of their own accord. Federal and state ministers have cancelled NAPLAN tests and while the Higher School Certificate and Victoria Certificate of Education are going ahead, questions remain around when and if exams will be held and how final results will be calculated. Dr Jim Watterston, a former teacher and dean of the Melbourne University Graduate School of Education, said some private schools had already successfully moved their teaching online and ""there is capacity for kids to learn a lot"". On a national level, he predicted the lost year from the coronavirus will ""drag Australian education into the 21st century"". ""We've known about the online environment and the capacity for learning to be enhanced ... but we've never really taken that up,"" he said. ""I think schools will be different [after coronavirus]. We'll not only be prepared for future crisis events, but we'll be able to stimulate and educate kids in a way that suits their generation."" But amid the optimism, there is also concern about the children without up-to-date devices and fast internet access being left behind, even though schools will also provide hard copies of work. According to a 2020 Australian Council of Social Services/ University of News South Wales report, about 774,000 children under 15, or 17.7 per cent of Australian children are in poverty. ""My real worry is the equity in all this,"" Dr Watterston said. ""This always assumes people have online capacity."" While there is a lot of uncertainty ahead, the experts agree that a large number of students repeating the year is neither wise nor practical. Craig Petersen, the NSW Secondary Principals' Council acting president, said one of the main questions being asked by parents was the need for children to repeat the year. ""My answer to that is no, because we simply can't. Some schools are bursting at the seems now,"" he said. ""We can't stop kids who are in preschool coming to school next year ... We need to find the solution this year for getting through the content as best we can, focusing on what's really core."" Grattan Institute school education fellow Julie Sonnemann said ""the evidence shows repeating a year has negative effects"" in usual circumstances. Ms Sonnemann said all students will feel the impact of significant time away from the classroom, but there are particular vulnerabilities for children in the early years of school. ""The evidence says each stage has its own challenges. When you miss certain concepts in your learning trajectory, often it impedes your learning further on,"" she said. ""If your reading or times tables don't get cemented early on, that creates a whole backlog of problems."" Others, however, say the impact of school closures will be be felt more by older high school students. Mr Petersen said there is more flexibility with younger students, as any content missed can be made up in future years. ""If a child's in year 11 and 12, we haven't got the luxury of time."" Ms Sonnemann said Australia should be thinking of targeted catch-up strategies to respond to the coronavirus, such as one-on-one or small group tutoring. She also points to US think tank, The Brookings Institution, which suggested summer school as a possible solution. Replay   ""Students who struggled to learn during the coronavirus school closure period could attend in the summer to catch back up,"" non-resident senior fellow Douglas N Harris said. The approach has another advantage - the extra pay for teachers would also be an economic stimulus. As parents and students grapple with the idea of a disrupted school year, education leaders are also calling for calm. Dr Watterston said schools will be able to accommodate gaps in learning next year. ""There will have to be some flexibility for teachers in 2021 about not being as faithful to the curriculum as they would have otherwise been,"" he said. On Tuesday, Nowra High School principal Glen Kingsley similarly told parents not to worry about their children falling behind in their studies, while emphasising the importance of mental health. ""Don't worry about them regressing in school,"" Mr Kingsley posted in an open letter on Facebook. ""Every single kid is in this boat and they all will be ok. When we are back in the classroom, we will all course correct and meet them where they are. Teachers are experts at this!"" He also advised parents not to reprimand their kids if they did not ""follow the schedule"" at home. ""If I can leave you with one thing, it's this: at the end of all of this, your kids' mental health will be more important than their academic skills.

The class of 2020 will get their HSC, although the form it will take is unclear.Credit:Marina Neil The head of the Association of Independent Schools NSW, Geoff Newcombe, said he was concerned that the combined impact of coronavirus, the drought and bushfires would leave parents struggling to pay fees. ""If the COVID-19 situation doesn‚Äôt improve by Easter, some independent schools will be in an extremely difficult position,"" he said. ""Independent schools are not-for-profit and operate on thin margins; they rely on school fees to meet their expenses. ‚ÄúAISNSW, together with its interstate colleagues, will be calling on the federal and state governments to provide emergency funding to ensure that vulnerable independent schools can continue to offer teaching in either an online mode at home or at school."" NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos condemned the move, saying it came as public schools were begging for soap and sanitiser, and a day after a $3.4 billion private school funding boost passed Parliament. ""At a time when our public schools are expressing deep concerns about a lack of resources ... the private school lobby shamelessly continues to seek to extract more and more and more from government,"" he said. The call came as examination authorities affirmed the class of 2020 will receive their HSC, but made no decision on exams and said it was still working on how to deal with students who were supposed to do group work and work placements. After a marathon meeting on Tuesday, the NESA board said it would set up a COVID-19 response committee and empower principals to decide how many assessments year 12 students sit and how they will be weighted. ""We want to assure you that you will be able to get a HSC certificate this year, and that the certificate will facilitate access to university, further education and employment, as it has for students over the past 50 years,"" NESA chair Peter Shergold said. The decision came as 75 per cent of public school children were kept home, as confusion grew among parents because of incorrect information from schools about which students were allowed to attend. Parental confusion intensified over whether to send their children to school after many principals contradicted the advice of the NSW government by saying only children of essential service workers could come to school. Amid reports that some students who did turn up to school were quizzed about why they were there, Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said those principals were wrong and that child could attend, although parents were encouraged to keep them home. ""School is open for those students who need to attend, no student is to be turned away,"" she said. Across the system, almost three-quarters of students stayed away, up from 40 per cent on Monday. Normal absentee rates are around 8 per cent. At some public schools, attendance was as low as 2 per cent. At private schools, students also did their lessons from home; at MLC School at Burwood, 130 out of the 1260 students were on campus. But childcare centres remain open, as did TAFE, where online learning is being used if possible but where many students don't have access to computers or need practical lessons in subjects such as carpentry. An email to TAFE staff on Tuesday instructed teachers to ensure students washed their hands before class and kept 1.2 metres apart. ""If you have a student who appears to have cold or flu symptoms, please try not to embarrass them in front of the class,"" the email said. The NSW P&C Federation president Tim Spencer criticised the conflicting messages from the school, TAFE and childcare sectors, and different stances from governments. ""That's a really confusing message for parents,"" he said. ""The governments ... need to get behind a concerted effort. They should either close the whole lot down, or they leave things open, you can't have this in-between situation."" Private schools that have put their courses online are not reducing fees, saying families in financial distress could approach them to discuss their situation. ""We are working closely with families individually to understand their concerns and pressures and will continue to assist them as we are able during this time,"" a spokeswoman for Cranbrook school said. The principal of Waverley College, Graham Leddie, said: ""I ask families who have difficult circumstances to stay in conversation with us.""

""We are working closely with families individually to understand their concerns and pressures and will continue to assist them as we are able during this time,"" a spokeswoman for Cranbrook school said. The principal of Waverley College, Graham Leddie, said: ""I ask families who have difficult circumstances to stay in conversation with us.""

Decisive action was required and she squibbed it (""Premier asks parents to keep children home but schools remain open"", smh.com.au, March 23). Taking an each-way bet on school closures with her confusing, contradictory advice to keep children at home while schools remain open in NSW puts the responsibility on parents instead of her government. As the pandemic curve tends vertical, it's no time to compromise on crucial closure of workplaces where people gather in large numbers with no chance of social distancing. The bullying Morrison is now determining NSW outcomes and not for the better. We know from the bushfires exactly how slow and inadequate his reaction is to an emergency situation that requires an intelligent, agile response. Agility is not in his lexicon. The Premier must take the necessary action to keep our teachers and children safe - an action that should have been taken weeks ago. Close the schools now. - Scott Simpson, Moruya It is not helpful for the Premier to ask people to keep children home from school whilst at the same time saying that if they have no option, it is OK to send their children to school. How is a parent who has no option supposed to feel about that? - Stephen Paull, Pyrmont This should not be a matter of individual choice. The wealthy can afford to make that choice ‚Äî the disadvantaged cannot. - Sharelle Fellows, Gulgong To stop the virus spreading, action must be taken early on social isolation, lockdowns and school closures, put in place with absolute clarity in messaging and strictly enforced. We are seeing none of that in Australia, instead we see procrastination in making hard decisions, confusing messages and, on Sunday, Canberra and the states diverged altogether. Closing schools should have been an early and easy decision, but when independent schools announced last week that they plan to close the federal government threatened them with withdrawal of funding. - David Leung, Beverly Hills What is never considered in all the finger-wagging, hand-wringing and paternalistic pronouncements is the increased threat to the health of the state‚Äôs teachers who, despite all medical advice to the contrary, are obliged to continue to turn up to work. The current health advice from the department, buried beneath the many mealy-mouthed platitudes and empty praise for the way we have ""embraced evolving requirements"", is to continue to encourage hand-washing and social distancing of 1.5 metres for students. This, in small classrooms with teenagers whose default is to drape themselves across each other and sneeze on their desks, is laughable. Why is the health of teachers not at least of equal importance to the health of other government employees and the students that we teach? - Jo Curry, Haberfield Illustration: John ShakespeareCredit:  Recent correspondents are urging school closure and distance education. This is based on the false assumption that the NBN or some internet connection is available to all. A friend asked their primary class how many had the internet at home. Answer: one-third! - Stephen Dunn, Bonnells Bay If students are being encouraged to stay home where possible, why aren't the students who need to be at school for supervision required to go to their closest school? I understand that it helps for a bit of normality, but so many students, especially at selective and private schools travel 1.5 to two hours one way to school each day. All the work is now online and classes aren't running normally so they wouldn't be losing much by attending a different school. Shouldn't we be keeping young students off public transport and asking them to attend their closest school if they can't stay home? - Danielle Villafana, The Ponds  I was both amazed and alarmed that none of your opinion piece scribes mentioned schools and the risk they impose on both teachers, parents and grandparents of students (""Keep your distance or pay the price"", March 23). How can one practice social distancing in a school of 1500 children and 40 to a class? In the high school where both my daughter and son-in-law work, they have stopped putting soap dispensers, hand sanitisers and toilet paper in the students‚Äô washrooms because of the constant vandalising of both. The school has literally given up. Scott Morrison may be thinking of the effect on children‚Äôs education by not closing schools but what about the effect on the health of teachers who are parents and grandparents themselves. This is very selfish thinking when one considers that parliament is closing after only one sitting day to protect the health of politicians. - Chris Tiley, Nana Glen  Unprecedented? Depends, doesn‚Äôt it? At 93, hardly. After surviving World War II army service, I remember in the early 1960s ‚Äì as part of a civil defence team in a small country town north of London ‚Äì being advised to plan to receive busloads of London old-timers and prepare for their accommodation. At the same time, we were advised that if London were to appear on the horizon as an atomic cloud, then our new regional capital would be Cambridge. The difference this time is that the enemy is not other human beings. This time it is ourselves and how we react to our common problem. We golden oldies are the most vulnerable and the time may well be close that the bed situation in our hospitals becomes extraordinarily tight, as in Italy.  I fully support Professor Peter Singer (""Worst world problems loom"", The Sun-Herald, March 22) who suggests that, if infected, the really elderly, placed in a triage situation similar to a younger person competing for that same single bed and treatment, should consider taking second spot. I, like the rest my elderly cohort, have benefited from Australia‚Äôs medical facilities to reach an age impossible for virtually all of my ancestors since the beginning of time. - Ed Raftery, Davistown I was a nurse in the 1960s at Prince Henry Hospital, Little Bay, in the infectious diseases wards. We had all manner of highly infectious illnesses there, viral and bacterial, and there was no 'social distancing' as we cared physically for the patients. We used gauze masks and laundered cotton gowns; we did not use gloves but washed our hands after every patient contact. The rate of infection in staff was very low. Maybe a solution to the shortage of masks and gowns would be to have a massive sewing bee, then set up hospital laundries, which would be comparatively simple, would give a lot of people jobs and would save a great deal of money. - Heather Phillips, Wahroonga If the grocery stores were to open only every second day (and allow say Woolies and IGA one day and Coles and Aldi the next), that would then allow each shop to resupply their shelves and keep employing all staff to pack the shelves on the off day. As well as this, allow people to shop using their address number ‚Äì odds one day, evens the next. With some tweaking and governance, this system would give certainty to everyone and would stop the panic. Please governments, do something logical. - Joy Paterson, Mount Annan One advantage of being part of the most at risk cohort during this pandemic is that we are children of a generation who survived the Great Depression and then World War II. They lost jobs and put their lives on hold for five years and often lost much more than that. The survivors built this country and gave the generations that came after a life and wealth of which they could only dream. We, too, can pull together. We can foresee an end to coronavirus far more readily than people could have foreseen the end of those horrifying wars. - Lynne Head, Budgewoi Bondi Beach is more than 800 metres long and 50m wide, which equates to 40,000 square metres. Following PM Morrison‚Äôs social distancing rules, the beach could safely hold 10,000 people. Meanwhile, the government allowed thousands of passengers to disembark from floating virus palaces without even checking their health. All this while pubs and clubs remained open. The NSW Health Minister says, with hindsight, the Ruby Princess passengers should have been dealt with differently, but Amanda Vanstone (""Beachgoers win the selfish and stupid award"", March 23) sees no fault there. Let‚Äôs blame beachgoers for the spreading disaster. Get real. This pandemic has spread because of the state and federal governments' reluctance to do anything that may have hurt their business sponsors, and now it‚Äôs too late. - Peter Newberry, Randwick I would have thought immigration officials letting 2000 cruise passengers walk off a ship into suburbia, or hundreds of airline passengers leaving terminals without so much as a temperature check, just as worthy of Amanda Vanstone's bile as the (mostly) innocent Bondi Beach-goers who sought sorely needed exercise and fresh air. The word ""scapegoats"" comes to mind. - Patrick McGrath, Potts Point Australians have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the Department of Home Affairs and Border Force, which are charged with protecting our borders from overseas threats. Yet, in their first real challenge, their performance has been woeful. Had these agencies focused even a fraction of the zeal and resources on COVID-19 that they have displayed in tracking and imprisoning a few thousand refugees, none of whom has been shown to be a threat, then our situation today would be a much happier one. It's time to direct resources away from these failed agencies to those we expect to protect us more effectively ‚Äì our neglected, underfunded public health systems. - Mary Lindsay, Duffy (ACT) One result of police closing Balmoral Beach on Sunday afternoon was, with everyone leaving at the same time, a very overcrowded and stuffy 257 bus. I'd rather have taken my chances on the beach, with its fresh sea breeze. - Graham Short, Cremorne I was surprised to read that Sydney Airport is still not screening international arrivals (Letters, March 23). I arrived back from Britain via Singapore on Thursday. At Changi Airport, in Singapore, they have infrared screening of all incoming passengers, plus temperature testing of about every third or fourth individual passenger. At Sydney Airport? Nothing: no screening, no testing, nothing at all. On the Heathrow-Singapore leg of our flight, some of the Singaporeans were in full hazmat outfits; others were in head-to-toe thick clear plastic raincoats, all with hoods, face masks and goggles. Many of the other passengers didn‚Äôt even have face masks. - Penny Ransby Smith, Lane Cove Not sure why anyone is surprised about hoarding and price gouging. This is Scott Morrison‚Äôs Australia, where it‚Äôs every person for themselves, and where people have been taught and encouraged to have no compassion for the vulnerable. It‚Äôs ""have a go to get a go"", right? It‚Äôs entrepreneurial, right? It‚Äôs small government, cutting-red-tape ""bureaucracy busting"", where there are no regulations against this stuff and no one to enforce them even if there were. I‚Äôd love to think this experience might teach people the benefit of a safety net, of a well-resourced, strong public service and bureaucracy, ready to respond at a time of crisis. - Mary-Jayne House, Long Jetty The past 40 years has encouraged us all to be selfish. We measure success and worth based on monetary wealth. We laud the millionaires and billionaires. We are told that greed is good and that money makes the world go round. Yet the people who add the most value to society ‚Äì teachers, nurses, care workers, volunteers ‚Äì are generally ignored and rewarded the least. If there is any good to come out of this crisis, I hope it will be a re-evaluation of what is really important in society. - Caroline Pearce, Manly I recently visited my local pharmacy with my daughter to buy some hand sanitiser. After shaking with helpless mirth, the pharmacy assistant said they were completely out of that product. As we walked out, a young mother holding an infant said she had overheard the conversation and offered me some sanitiser that she had in the car. When my daughter and I demurred, she said: ""Well, if it was my father, I wouldn't want him to go without"". So we followed her to the car and she gave me the bottle. Such kindness from a stranger lifted my spirits in this difficult time. - Gerry Foley, South Turramurra I think that we could come out of this COVID-19 problem with a better world than when we entered it. Despite the inevitable and totally regrettable loss of life, I see a necessary move away from the market failure of neo-liberalism in the First World towards the emergence of larger government involvement in the economy. That is, the end of the privatisation fetish, which is incapable of handling the emergency of a virus ‚Äì a medical situation that has rocked the financial structures of the world as we know it. Dare we hope for a modicum of (shock, horror) socialism? - David Ray, Birchgrove Hundreds of thousands of tourist and temporary work visa holders ‚Äì including about 140,000 backpackers and 7000 seasonal workers ‚Äì will be affected by unemployment and closures, especially in the services industry. What will become of them? They don‚Äôt have access to Centrelink and may lack medical support. - Linda Shaw, Braddon, ACT Illustration: Matt GoldingCredit:  It would be good if this crisis led to the cessation of one of the worst rorts in Australia ‚Äì credit card interest rates. Most people who don‚Äôt own property or other securities find that their only ready source of finance in times of financial stress is credit card debt. The fact that this situation still exists after the banking royal commission is quite outrageous, and it‚Äôs about to have a serious impact on the financial welfare of a great number of low income workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. - Mike Rose, Newport The other side of ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù is increasing the number of critical care facilities. Shouldn‚Äôt the army and reservists, and anyone else with relevant skills, be pressed into service to build temporary hospital acute care. I‚Äôm 71. If I need a respirator, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs in a tent. - Kevin Fell, Newcastle Can I suggest that Qantas redeploy some of their laid-off staff to their phones. I have been trying for days now without success to speak to a human with my unique travel issue. - Peter O‚ÄôBrien, Shoalhaven Heads It turns out that coal is not going to save our economy. Seems that education and tourism and the environment are actually important, and we should have been investing in those sectors. - Allan Kreuiter, Roseville I wonder whether the government payments to business will be through a cashless welfare card. - Bill Holley, Mayfield I have just watched the PM. All I could hear was a very aggressive hand-washing of coronavirus responsibility. - Peter Hull, Hat Head With banks suspending mortgage repayments for homeowners, the government must rule that renters no longer have to pay rent. If this seriously compromises the landlord, then the landlord needs to avail of the government benefit available for businesses that are no longer earning an income. - John Harrison, Kensington The government‚Äôs financial package is woefully inadequate. Allowing people to raid their super is a terrible idea, especially with the freefall on sharemarkets. The British government is going to pay 80 per cent of the wages of people who are stood down or quarantined and can‚Äôt work from home. There are no purely financial constraints on the Australian government that prevent them from doing likewise. They can and should support affected people‚Äôs incomes now so that money will continue to flow through the system. - Stephen Power, Sutherland A tiny advertisement on page 9 (Monday, March 23) gives notice of a ‚Äúcommunity information session‚Äù on Monday, April 6 ‚Äì one that will be almost impossible for the community to attend. Defence has quietly received parliamentary approval for major redevelopment works to HMAS Watson. These works have been vigorously opposed. Watsons Bay Association president Roger Bayliss has called for the site to be absorbed into the South Head National Park for all Australians and the current naval base moved somewhere more appropriate for its expansion. If the works, planned to begin next month, go ahead, they will close the national park for five years and destroy the amenity of one of Sydney‚Äôs most popular walking trails. The whole exercise should be postponed until the coronavirus pandemic is over. - Alison Stewart, Riverview My 20-year-old son lives most of his life in his bedroom, playing computer games all night long. When this crisis is over, I'm going to thank him for diligently self-isolating during the great COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. I have a horrible feeling he will just stare at me blankly and ask, 'What's all this about a pandemic?' - Greg Cantori, Kareela Jobson Growthe was recently spotted outside a coronavirus clinic. Didn't look well. - John Bailey, Canterbury It‚Äôs life Scotty, but not as we know it [with apologies to Spock] (‚ÄúSydney in lockdown‚Äù, March 23). - Allan Gibson, Cherrybrook  It would appear the NRL is determined to be the game they play in heaven (""League of their own"", March 23). - Peter Fyfe, Enmore John Connell (Letters, March 21), the best place to start one‚Äôs self-isolation ‚Äòplague‚Äô reading is Geraldine Brooks‚Äô brilliant Year of Wonders about the English village that quarantines itself in 1666 to try to protect the rest of the country. - Jennifer Giles, Elizabeth Bay In his novel The Plague, Albert Camus wrote: ""There are more things to admire in men than to despise.""

We are seeing none of that in Australia, instead we see procrastination in making hard decisions, confusing messages and, on Sunday, Canberra and the states diverged altogether. Closing schools should have been an early and easy decision, but when independent schools announced last week that they plan to close the federal government threatened them with withdrawal of funding. - David Leung, Beverly Hills What is never considered in all the finger-wagging, hand-wringing and paternalistic pronouncements is the increased threat to the health of the state‚Äôs teachers who, despite all medical advice to the contrary, are obliged to continue to turn up to work. The current health advice from the department, buried beneath the many mealy-mouthed platitudes and empty praise for the way we have ""embraced evolving requirements"", is to continue to encourage hand-washing and social distancing of 1.5 metres for students. This, in small classrooms with teenagers whose default is to drape themselves across each other and sneeze on their desks, is laughable. Why is the health of teachers not at least of equal importance to the health of other government employees and the students that we teach? - Jo Curry, Haberfield Illustration: John ShakespeareCredit:  Recent correspondents are urging school closure and distance education. This is based on the false assumption that the NBN or some internet connection is available to all. A friend asked their primary class how many had the internet at home. Answer: one-third! - Stephen Dunn, Bonnells Bay If students are being encouraged to stay home where possible, why aren't the students who need to be at school for supervision required to go to their closest school? I understand that it helps for a bit of normality, but so many students, especially at selective and private schools travel 1.5 to two hours one way to school each day. All the work is now online and classes aren't running normally so they wouldn't be losing much by attending a different school. Shouldn't we be keeping young students off public transport and asking them to attend their closest school if they can't stay home? - Danielle Villafana, The Ponds  I was both amazed and alarmed that none of your opinion piece scribes mentioned schools and the risk they impose on both teachers, parents and grandparents of students (""Keep your distance or pay the price"", March 23). How can one practice social distancing in a school of 1500 children and 40 to a class? In the high school where both my daughter and son-in-law work, they have stopped putting soap dispensers, hand sanitisers and toilet paper in the students‚Äô washrooms because of the constant vandalising of both. The school has literally given up. Scott Morrison may be thinking of the effect on children‚Äôs education by not closing schools but what about the effect on the health of teachers who are parents and grandparents themselves. This is very selfish thinking when one considers that parliament is closing after only one sitting day to protect the health of politicians. - Chris Tiley, Nana Glen  Unprecedented? Depends, doesn‚Äôt it? At 93, hardly. After surviving World War II army service, I remember in the early 1960s ‚Äì as part of a civil defence team in a small country town north of London ‚Äì being advised to plan to receive busloads of London old-timers and prepare for their accommodation. At the same time, we were advised that if London were to appear on the horizon as an atomic cloud, then our new regional capital would be Cambridge. The difference this time is that the enemy is not other human beings. This time it is ourselves and how we react to our common problem. We golden oldies are the most vulnerable and the time may well be close that the bed situation in our hospitals becomes extraordinarily tight, as in Italy.  I fully support Professor Peter Singer (""Worst world problems loom"", The Sun-Herald, March 22) who suggests that, if infected, the really elderly, placed in a triage situation similar to a younger person competing for that same single bed and treatment, should consider taking second spot. I, like the rest my elderly cohort, have benefited from Australia‚Äôs medical facilities to reach an age impossible for virtually all of my ancestors since the beginning of time. - Ed Raftery, Davistown I was a nurse in the 1960s at Prince Henry Hospital, Little Bay, in the infectious diseases wards. We had all manner of highly infectious illnesses there, viral and bacterial, and there was no 'social distancing' as we cared physically for the patients. We used gauze masks and laundered cotton gowns; we did not use gloves but washed our hands after every patient contact. The rate of infection in staff was very low. Maybe a solution to the shortage of masks and gowns would be to have a massive sewing bee, then set up hospital laundries, which would be comparatively simple, would give a lot of people jobs and would save a great deal of money. - Heather Phillips, Wahroonga If the grocery stores were to open only every second day (and allow say Woolies and IGA one day and Coles and Aldi the next), that would then allow each shop to resupply their shelves and keep employing all staff to pack the shelves on the off day. As well as this, allow people to shop using their address number ‚Äì odds one day, evens the next. With some tweaking and governance, this system would give certainty to everyone and would stop the panic. Please governments, do something logical. - Joy Paterson, Mount Annan One advantage of being part of the most at risk cohort during this pandemic is that we are children of a generation who survived the Great Depression and then World War II. They lost jobs and put their lives on hold for five years and often lost much more than that. The survivors built this country and gave the generations that came after a life and wealth of which they could only dream. We, too, can pull together. We can foresee an end to coronavirus far more readily than people could have foreseen the end of those horrifying wars. - Lynne Head, Budgewoi Bondi Beach is more than 800 metres long and 50m wide, which equates to 40,000 square metres. Following PM Morrison‚Äôs social distancing rules, the beach could safely hold 10,000 people. Meanwhile, the government allowed thousands of passengers to disembark from floating virus palaces without even checking their health. All this while pubs and clubs remained open. The NSW Health Minister says, with hindsight, the Ruby Princess passengers should have been dealt with differently, but Amanda Vanstone (""Beachgoers win the selfish and stupid award"", March 23) sees no fault there. Let‚Äôs blame beachgoers for the spreading disaster. Get real. This pandemic has spread because of the state and federal governments' reluctance to do anything that may have hurt their business sponsors, and now it‚Äôs too late. - Peter Newberry, Randwick I would have thought immigration officials letting 2000 cruise passengers walk off a ship into suburbia, or hundreds of airline passengers leaving terminals without so much as a temperature check, just as worthy of Amanda Vanstone's bile as the (mostly) innocent Bondi Beach-goers who sought sorely needed exercise and fresh air. The word ""scapegoats"" comes to mind. - Patrick McGrath, Potts Point Australians have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the Department of Home Affairs and Border Force, which are charged with protecting our borders from overseas threats. Yet, in their first real challenge, their performance has been woeful. Had these agencies focused even a fraction of the zeal and resources on COVID-19 that they have displayed in tracking and imprisoning a few thousand refugees, none of whom has been shown to be a threat, then our situation today would be a much happier one. It's time to direct resources away from these failed agencies to those we expect to protect us more effectively ‚Äì our neglected, underfunded public health systems. - Mary Lindsay, Duffy (ACT) One result of police closing Balmoral Beach on Sunday afternoon was, with everyone leaving at the same time, a very overcrowded and stuffy 257 bus. I'd rather have taken my chances on the beach, with its fresh sea breeze. - Graham Short, Cremorne I was surprised to read that Sydney Airport is still not screening international arrivals (Letters, March 23). I arrived back from Britain via Singapore on Thursday. At Changi Airport, in Singapore, they have infrared screening of all incoming passengers, plus temperature testing of about every third or fourth individual passenger. At Sydney Airport? Nothing: no screening, no testing, nothing at all. On the Heathrow-Singapore leg of our flight, some of the Singaporeans were in full hazmat outfits; others were in head-to-toe thick clear plastic raincoats, all with hoods, face masks and goggles. Many of the other passengers didn‚Äôt even have face masks. - Penny Ransby Smith, Lane Cove Not sure why anyone is surprised about hoarding and price gouging. This is Scott Morrison‚Äôs Australia, where it‚Äôs every person for themselves, and where people have been taught and encouraged to have no compassion for the vulnerable. It‚Äôs ""have a go to get a go"", right? It‚Äôs entrepreneurial, right? It‚Äôs small government, cutting-red-tape ""bureaucracy busting"", where there are no regulations against this stuff and no one to enforce them even if there were. I‚Äôd love to think this experience might teach people the benefit of a safety net, of a well-resourced, strong public service and bureaucracy, ready to respond at a time of crisis. - Mary-Jayne House, Long Jetty The past 40 years has encouraged us all to be selfish. We measure success and worth based on monetary wealth. We laud the millionaires and billionaires. We are told that greed is good and that money makes the world go round. Yet the people who add the most value to society ‚Äì teachers, nurses, care workers, volunteers ‚Äì are generally ignored and rewarded the least. If there is any good to come out of this crisis, I hope it will be a re-evaluation of what is really important in society. - Caroline Pearce, Manly I recently visited my local pharmacy with my daughter to buy some hand sanitiser. After shaking with helpless mirth, the pharmacy assistant said they were completely out of that product. As we walked out, a young mother holding an infant said she had overheard the conversation and offered me some sanitiser that she had in the car. When my daughter and I demurred, she said: ""Well, if it was my father, I wouldn't want him to go without"". So we followed her to the car and she gave me the bottle. Such kindness from a stranger lifted my spirits in this difficult time. - Gerry Foley, South Turramurra I think that we could come out of this COVID-19 problem with a better world than when we entered it. Despite the inevitable and totally regrettable loss of life, I see a necessary move away from the market failure of neo-liberalism in the First World towards the emergence of larger government involvement in the economy. That is, the end of the privatisation fetish, which is incapable of handling the emergency of a virus ‚Äì a medical situation that has rocked the financial structures of the world as we know it. Dare we hope for a modicum of (shock, horror) socialism? - David Ray, Birchgrove Hundreds of thousands of tourist and temporary work visa holders ‚Äì including about 140,000 backpackers and 7000 seasonal workers ‚Äì will be affected by unemployment and closures, especially in the services industry. What will become of them? They don‚Äôt have access to Centrelink and may lack medical support. - Linda Shaw, Braddon, ACT Illustration: Matt GoldingCredit:  It would be good if this crisis led to the cessation of one of the worst rorts in Australia ‚Äì credit card interest rates. Most people who don‚Äôt own property or other securities find that their only ready source of finance in times of financial stress is credit card debt. The fact that this situation still exists after the banking royal commission is quite outrageous, and it‚Äôs about to have a serious impact on the financial welfare of a great number of low income workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. - Mike Rose, Newport The other side of ‚Äúflattening the curve‚Äù is increasing the number of critical care facilities. Shouldn‚Äôt the army and reservists, and anyone else with relevant skills, be pressed into service to build temporary hospital acute care. I‚Äôm 71. If I need a respirator, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs in a tent. - Kevin Fell, Newcastle Can I suggest that Qantas redeploy some of their laid-off staff to their phones. I have been trying for days now without success to speak to a human with my unique travel issue. - Peter O‚ÄôBrien, Shoalhaven Heads It turns out that coal is not going to save our economy. Seems that education and tourism and the environment are actually important, and we should have been investing in those sectors. - Allan Kreuiter, Roseville I wonder whether the government payments to business will be through a cashless welfare card. - Bill Holley, Mayfield I have just watched the PM. All I could hear was a very aggressive hand-washing of coronavirus responsibility. - Peter Hull, Hat Head With banks suspending mortgage repayments for homeowners, the government must rule that renters no longer have to pay rent. If this seriously compromises the landlord, then the landlord needs to avail of the government benefit available for businesses that are no longer earning an income. - John Harrison, Kensington The government‚Äôs financial package is woefully inadequate. Allowing people to raid their super is a terrible idea, especially with the freefall on sharemarkets. The British government is going to pay 80 per cent of the wages of people who are stood down or quarantined and can‚Äôt work from home. There are no purely financial constraints on the Australian government that prevent them from doing likewise. They can and should support affected people‚Äôs incomes now so that money will continue to flow through the system. - Stephen Power, Sutherland A tiny advertisement on page 9 (Monday, March 23) gives notice of a ‚Äúcommunity information session‚Äù on Monday, April 6 ‚Äì one that will be almost impossible for the community to attend. Defence has quietly received parliamentary approval for major redevelopment works to HMAS Watson. These works have been vigorously opposed. Watsons Bay Association president Roger Bayliss has called for the site to be absorbed into the South Head National Park for all Australians and the current naval base moved somewhere more appropriate for its expansion. If the works, planned to begin next month, go ahead, they will close the national park for five years and destroy the amenity of one of Sydney‚Äôs most popular walking trails. The whole exercise should be postponed until the coronavirus pandemic is over. - Alison Stewart, Riverview My 20-year-old son lives most of his life in his bedroom, playing computer games all night long. When this crisis is over, I'm going to thank him for diligently self-isolating during the great COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. I have a horrible feeling he will just stare at me blankly and ask, 'What's all this about a pandemic?' - Greg Cantori, Kareela Jobson Growthe was recently spotted outside a coronavirus clinic. Didn't look well. - John Bailey, Canterbury It‚Äôs life Scotty, but not as we know it [with apologies to Spock] (‚ÄúSydney in lockdown‚Äù, March 23). - Allan Gibson, Cherrybrook  It would appear the NRL is determined to be the game they play in heaven (""League of their own"", March 23). - Peter Fyfe, Enmore John Connell (Letters, March 21), the best place to start one‚Äôs self-isolation ‚Äòplague‚Äô reading is Geraldine Brooks‚Äô brilliant Year of Wonders about the English village that quarantines itself in 1666 to try to protect the rest of the country. - Jennifer Giles, Elizabeth Bay In his novel The Plague, Albert Camus wrote: ""There are more things to admire in men than to despise.""

After flagging a school shutdown for all but the children of essential workers on Sunday, the NSW government softened its stance on Monday and said while parents would be encouraged to keep their children home, no student would be turned away from school.

The president of the union, Angelo Gavrielatos, called for complete health protection for all teachers - including allowing anyone not confident of their health to work from home - and complete logistical support to enable core staff to provide supervision of children employed in essential services, or those who needed to attend school for equity reasons.

""If both of these conditions cannot be demonstrably met [by Tuesday afternoon], then the executive will be professionally bound to call for the closure of public schools and the provision of ongoing education via distance technologies,‚Äù he said in a statement.

""This isn't a decision that should be left to parents - it is only causing further anxiety, confusion and uncertainty,"" the Public Service Association said. Parents said they found the advice confusing, and many felt that they were in a moral and financial quandary, having to choose between working and looking after their children at home. ""There's a lot that think their kids are better off in school, or are driven by the need for their kids to be looked after while they are at work, particularly the younger kids,"" said David Hope, president of the Northern Sydney District Council of P&C Associations.

Kay Turner, chief executive of not-for-profit SDN Children's Services, which operates 30 centres, said some families were confused whether messages about school closures applied to early learning centres after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Monday encouraged parents to keep children at home. Replay   ""We‚Äôve had follow up communication that says early childhood care and education centres will remain open in NSW and should continue to operate to support families who need care. But the public messaging could be clearer,"" Ms Turner said. The federal government's expert medical advice is for the childcare sector to remain open and children to attend centres, except when health authorities have directed individual services to close. The Vaucluse Cottage childcare centre in the eastern suburbs confirmed a case of COVID-19 on Monday, while Smeaton Grange Young Academics Child Care Centre in Camden is closed until next week after a childcare worker tested positive on Sunday. NSW Minister for Education and Early Childhood Learning Sarah Mitchell said the state government ""will be encouraging [early childhood] services to remain open, but there will be challenges which we will work with them to address"". State and federal governments are negotiating funding support for the sector. ""There is a risk of the sector collapsing and having a catastrophic impact if there is [directed closure] and no rescue package,"" Ms Turner said. She said there had not been the same 30 per cent fall in attendance as in public schools, however, families have been more likely to terminate enrolments altogether. Ms Turner said the sector was awaiting legislation introduced in federal parliament on Monday, which will relax rules around absenteeism and eligibility¬†for the childcare subsidy, to prevent drop-outs. ""Next we‚Äôre hoping for further direction around waivers of regulations, some simpler processes so that if we need to move staff around between centres we can manage that quickly with less red tape,"" she said. While there is little concern about children becoming seriously ill with coronavirus, workers are worried about coming into contact with parents or travelling long distances on public transport. Australian Childcare Alliance NSW chief executive Chiang Lim said services in metropolitan areas were ""upping their protocols to minimise adult interaction"".

However, after a meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday night, when Prime Minister Scott Morrison reiterated the importance of schools staying open, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a modified policy. Under the new plan, all public school students will do ""a single unit of [remote] learning"" and parents will be encouraged to keep their children home, but schools will remain open to supervise those children whose parents must work. The advice from the nation's top health experts - that sending children to school is still the safest option for the community as a whole - has not shifted. Mr Gavrielatos said he was worried for the teaching workforce, and would ask Ms Mitchell at the 4pm meeting for complete health protection for all teachers, including any teacher who is not confident of health protection to be allowed to work for home. The union will also call for complete logistical, industrial and professional support to let core staff provide supervision for students whose parents are employed in essential services and for those whose parents cannot care for their children for equity reasons. ""IF both of these conditions cannot be demonstrably met, then the executive will be professionally bound to call for the closure of public schools and the provision of ongoing education via distance technologies."" The Independent Education Union NSW/ACT is also calling for school closures, saying teachers were not protected enough. However, parents say they find the new advice confusing. They don't know what a ""single unit of learning"" means, and some say they would have to risk or give up their jobs to supervise their children at home. ""There's a lot of parents who think they have to keep their kids away from school because of the dangers,"" David Hope, president of the Northern Sydney District Council of P&C Associations, said. ""Some parents who have taken their kids out of school have suddenly realised what a burden it is, and may put their kids back into school. ""There's a lot that understand the medical arguments and think their kids are better off in school, or are driven by the need for their kids to be looked after while they are at work, particularly the younger kids."" Some public schools are reporting drops in attendance of 30 per cent on Monday, slightly more than last week, when about 24 per cent of students in public schools stayed away. Others say up to half of students are absent today. UNICEF has warned that children around the world will face increasing threats to safety and wellbeing, including mistreatment, violence and separation from caregivers due to the virus pandemic. ""UNICEF is urging governments to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children amid the intensifying socioeconomic fallout from the disease,"" it said.

""However, we do recommend, where possible that people work from home to reduce the social interaction to ensure that social distancing is respected and maintained."" Ms Berejiklian stressed these actions were adopted on the basis of health advice.

Among the latest cases is a childcare worker at Vaucluse Cottage Childcare centre. All children and staff who were at the centre on March 16 are considered close contacts and are being contacted by NSW Health and told to self-isolate until midnight on March 30. A resident at Quakers Hill nursing home has also tested positive for the virus. The resident is being treated at Westmead Hospital and health authorities are conducting contact tracing. More cases have been linked to cruise ships that recently docked in Sydney harbour - 27 in NSW passengers and 21 interstate. Five additional cases have been confirmed among passengers who were aboard the Ovation of the Seas. Overseas acquired infections accounted for 327 cases and 155 are close contacts or other confirmed cases. There are 65 locally acquired cases and the remainder are under investigation.

NAPLAN has facilitated comparative reporting on state, territory and school performance since 2008, although regrettably it will not be held this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The measurement of literacy and numeracy standards has always been a priority for education ministers, being foundational to learning and success at school. We must learn how to retain the best of NAPLAN while transforming it.Credit:Hank Van Stuivenberg Even though frequently referred to as a ‚Äòdiagnostic‚Äô assessment, NAPLAN technically is not. Rather, it is a point-in-time summative assessment that contains a very robust, valid and reliable set of tests. But while there can be no disputing the importance of this national data, we have over time ‚àí not unlike the United States ‚àí overrated NAPLAN results by assigning to them important purposes on which they cannot deliver. Most notably, NAPLAN lacks the breadth and depth sufficient to produce a balanced measure of school performance. In a report by highly-respected academic Professor Bill Louden, he writes: ‚ÄúNAPLAN provides important but incomplete information on school quality‚Äù. We know that there is much more to schools than their NAPLAN scores. For individual students, it is essentially a ‚Äòtraffic light‚Äô that indicates: Going Well; Warning Signs; or Failing to Cope. NAPLAN longitudinal results have not achieved broad-based, national improvement nor provided ongoing support to teachers in classrooms. Additionally, the recent transition from paper-based to online delivery of the tests has been technically problematic ‚àí most likely a combination of inadequate infrastructure and an immense load on the system. Is it time to transform NAPLAN? Absolutely. We must consider how to retain NAPLAN‚Äôs valuable national benchmarking role while transforming it into a powerful ‚Äòformative‚Äô assessment tool. Granted, many teachers currently use NAPLAN data to inform their teaching and to record individual student attainment. However, NAPLAN does not directly improve teaching and learning.  So, because research consistency shows the power of formative assessment that supports and guides rather than rates and ranks students, NAPLAN needs reconceptualising. We have a massive bank of high-quality questions given 12 years of testing. Let us suppose that we offer NAPLAN as an on-demand, online test that is managed by schools. The system would be available to teachers to activate when they consider their class, or individual students, are ready for progress testing. There could be staged and sequenced administration focussing on formative assessment delivered ‚Äòat the right time‚Äô. Results could still include scores but, more importantly, support materials for students - guiding them on how to address their weaknesses. Students would go on to undertake retesting as needed and when appropriate. Testing authorities could draw scientifically sampled national performance data from the system and continue to use it for annual benchmark reporting. For benchmarking purposes, the identity of the student or the school need not be reported. With the right will and commitment, this can all be achieved technically, securely and accurately. NAPLAN would become a national, not school, health check. This would also reduce many technical issues of online delivery. Of course, many are likely to argue that this corrupts the essence of NAPLAN. I disagree. It would mean high-quality tests available in classrooms to support student learning; continued national benchmark reporting; and the opportunity for school evaluation and improvement efforts to focus on much more suitable and broad-based measures. Is it a win-win for everyone? I entreat those in authority to have an informed discussion before summarily dismissing such a scenario.
