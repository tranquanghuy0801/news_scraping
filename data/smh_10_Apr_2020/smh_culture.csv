2,/culture/music/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-from-covid-19-complications-20200408-p54i87.html,Country folk singer John Prine dies from COVID-19 complications,"John Prine, the raspy-voiced country-folk singer whose ingenious lyrics to songs by turns poignant, angry and comic made him a favourite of Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and others, has died aged 73. The cause was complications from COVID-19, his family said. Prine underwent cancer surgery in 1998 to remove a tumour in his neck identified as squamous cell cancer, which had damaged his vocal cords. In 2013, he had part of one lung removed to treat lung cancer. He died on Tuesday at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee. Prine was a relative unknown in 1970 when Kristofferson heard him play one night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg, dragged there by singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. Kristofferson was performing in Chicago at the time at the Quiet Knight. At the Fifth Peg, Prine treated him to a brief after-hours performance of material that, Kristofferson later wrote, ""was unlike anything I'd heard before.""

""No way somebody this young can be writing so heavy,"" he said. ""John Prine is so good, we may have to break his thumbs."" Record executive Jerry Wexler, who was in the audience, signed Prine to a contract with Atlantic Records the next day. Music writers at the time were eager to crown a successor to Dylan, and Prine, with his nasal, sandpapery voice and literate way with a song, came ready to order. His debut album, called simply John Prine and released in 1971, included songs that became his signatures. Some gained wider fame after being recorded by other artists.

""He's a true folk singer in the best folk tradition, cutting right to the heart of things, as pure and simple as rain,"" Raitt told Rolling Stone in 1992. Dylan, listing his favourite songwriters for The Huffington Post in 2009, put Prine front and centre. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism,"" he said. ""Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs."" John Prine was born Oct. 10, 1946, in Maywood, Illinois, a working-class suburb of Chicago, to William and Verna (Hamm) Prine. His father, a tool-and-die maker at American Can Co., and his mother had moved from the coal town of Paradise, Kentucky, in the 1930s. Prine later wrote a ruefully bitter song titled Paradise, in which he sang: The coal company came with the world's largest shovel  And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land  Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man John grew up in a country music-loving family. He learned guitar as a young teenager from his grandfather and brother and began writing songs. After graduating from high school, he worked for the post office for two years before being drafted into the Army, which sent him to West Germany in charge of the motor pool at his base. After being discharged, he resumed his mail route, in and around his hometown, composing songs in his head. ""I always likened the mail route to a library with no books,"" he wrote on his website. ""I passed the time each day making up these little ditties."" Reluctantly, he took the stage for the first time at an open-mic night at the Fifth Peg, where his performance of Hello in There and Angel From Montgomery met with profound silence from the audience. ""They just sat there,"" Prine wrote. ""They didn't even applaud; they just looked at me."" Then the clapping began. ""It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions,"" he wrote. ""And to find that out all at once was amazing."" Not long after, Roger Ebert, the film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, wandered into the club while Prine was performing. He liked what he heard and wrote Prine's first review, under the headline Singing Mailman Who Delivers a Powerful Message in a Few Words. ""He appears onstage with such modesty he almost seems to be backing into the spotlight,"" Ebert wrote. ""He sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn't show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you."" Prine had a particular gift for offbeat humour, reflected in songs like Jesus, the Missing Years, Some Humans Ain't Human, Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone and the anti-war screed Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore. ""I guess what I always found funny was the human condition,"" he told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in 2013. ""There is a certain comedy and pathos to trouble and accidents."" John Prine in his office in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2017.Credit:AP/Mark Humphrey After recording several albums for Atlantic and Asylum, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, in 1984. He never had a hit record, but he commanded a loyal audience that ensured steady if modest sales for his albums and a durable concert career. In 1992, his album The Missing Years, with guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and other artists, won a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk recording. He received a second Grammy in the same category in 2006 for the album Fair and Square. Prine, who lived in Nashville, was divorced twice. He is survived by his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, a native of Ireland whom he married in 1996; three sons, Jody, Jack and Tommy; two brothers, Dave and Billy; and three grandchildren. In 2017, Prine published John Prine Beyond Words, a collection of lyrics, guitar chords, commentary and photographs from his own archive. In 2019, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and his album Tree of Forgiveness was nominated for a Grammy, for best Americana album. It was his 19th album and his first of original material in more than a decade. Prine went on tour in 2018 to promote Tree of Forgiveness,  and after a two-night stand at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville — known there as the mother church of country music — Margaret Renkl, a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, wrote, under the headline ""American Oracle"": ""The mother church of country music, where the seats are scratched-up pews and the windows are stained glass, is the place where the new John Prine — older now, scarred by cancer surgeries, his voice deeper and full of gravel — is most clearly still the old John Prine: mischievous, delighting in tomfoolery, but also worried about the world."" In December, he was chosen to receive a 2020 Grammy for lifetime achievement. New York Times Copyright © 2020", William Grimes ,"April 8, 2020"

Over four seasons as the socially unconventional detective Saga Norén in the cult Nordic drama The Bridge, she became the living embodiment of Scandi noir and its moody monochromatic hues. Which makes it somewhat incongruous to find the iconically Swedish actress amid the radioactive-red dust and dazzling sun of Broome. Hot property in the post-Saga era, Helin has been offered enough meaty role offers to make the average forty-something actress weep with envy, including playing Norway’s Crown Princess Marta in the recently wrapped series Atlantic Crossing. But in a neat globe-spanning bookend for fans of The Bridge, the project that has lured her to the Top End is the “tropical outback gothic noir” Mystery Road. “I love the fact I got a script that said, ‘Woman, aged 30 to 60 years,” says Sofia Helin.Credit:David Dare Parker The pithy description from producer David Jowsey sums up the critical and popular acclaim afforded the 2018 debut of a drama so embedded in northern Australia you can almost taste the grit. Led by Aaron Pedersen as lone wolf cop Jay Swan, it scooped a haul of gongs at the AACTAs. Perhaps more wonderfully for a drama with a largely Indigenous cast, crew and thematic preoccupations, it also won the publicly voted award of most popular drama at the 2019 Logies. Season two sees Helin playing a Swedish archaeologist digging, literally and metaphorically, into the Kimberley’s Indigenous lore. As Professor Sandra Elmquist, whose search for Indigenous cultural artefacts unearths a deep moral quandary, Helin has swapped the urban detective’s leather pants and Porsche for an Akubra, workboots and cargos. It’s Saga Noren gone Indiana Jones, and Helin is loving every minute of it. “Yesterday I had to film a fight scene where I roll around in the dust with Ngaire [Pigram, who plays an Indigenous activist protesting the archaeological dig]. It was such fun,” she says from a plastic chair outside Broome’s Uniting Church where many of the storylines, including the mysteries behind a bag of bones and a headless torso, find their point of balance. The “what next?” for the actor behind one of television’s most formative female characters was fortuitously taken from the script pile by her husband, who encouraged her to commit to the shoot. Aaron Pedersen as outback detective Jay Swan and Jada Alberts in Mystery Road.Credit:David Dare Parker “My husband saw the script and said, ‘I know you’re meant to be at home right now, but this is too good to turn down.' Mystery Road hadn’t been shown in Scandinavia but I read the script and I just had to do it,” she says. “It was on another level. It was so entertaining yet it’s a mystery that deals with real human questions, the moral questions, we must all ask ourselves from time to time.” For series producer Greer Simpkin,the casting of Helin was a wish-list sprung to life. “I loved The Bridge and when we discovered Sofia was available it was fantastic. We have two Indigenous leads this time and we were keen for an older female lead. Season one sold really well in Europe and the feedback was so positive for a mature female lead who has her own power and her own strength.” Judy Davis delivered an acclaimed performance in season one as policewoman Emma James and the casting of Helin packs a similarly weighty punch. The approach of Simpkin and Jowsey’s Bunya productions should be a masterclass in achieving such high-calibre casting coups. “I love the fact I got a script that said, ‘Woman, aged 30 to 60 years',” says Helin in her straight-talking Swedish way. “Normally it says, ‘Woman, 30 years old, beautiful’. It makes me want to puke.” Alongside Pedersen, who exudes charisma even while giving new meaning to the term laconic, the cast includes rising star playwright and stage actress Jada Alberts as Fran, an Indigenous cop in her first job haunted by the memory of the best friend who has been missing since childhood; Gary Sweet as pearl farmer and possible bad guy Alkemi; Ursula Yovich as Pansy, an unhappy wife with a voice of gold; Rob Collins as her traditional landowner husband Amos; and Mark Mitchinson as a senior cop too lazy or self-interested to shut down the local drug trade. Sofia Helin and Aaron Pedersen, Mystery Road season 2.Credit:David Dare Parker Noir with sunblock, it charts Swan’s move to the fictitious northern WA town of Gideon – the biblical undertones an apposite choice for a place steeped in the supernatural double whammy of Christianity and native lore – to be closer to estranged wife Mary (Tasma Walton) only to encounter the running interference of Callan Mulvey as Mary’s new semi-retired cop partner. The floating cast and crew of Mystery Road have formed what has been described as an Indigenous supergroup since it began life as Ivan Sen's feature films Mystery Road (2013) and Goldstone (2016). Rachel Perkins directed the first season, while its follow-up unconventionally unites Warwick Thornton (Sweet Country; Samson and Delilah) and Wayne Blair (The Sapphires; Top End Wedding) as co-directors. A songlines approach to storytelling follows the season one lead, sending its protagonists in search of answers to a current mystery while crime in “deep time” presents layers of complexity exploring the tension between two cultures and their uneasy cohabitation. “I’m trying to rewrite history,” says Helin’s professor archaeologist chasing a globally significant discovery to the Indigenous protestors railing at her camp. “And you’re trying to destroy it all.” The current hot-button issue of the repatriation of indigenous artefacts to their rightful owners is a timely insinuation into the Mystery Road oeuvre. “It asks the questions, who is writing history? Why should white people do it, who owns these artefacts?” says Helin. “It’s complicated. The archaeologists argue they need to be taken care of. But why do we think we own them? We should give them back.” A first-time visitor to Australia, she was catapulted into the middle of our national conversation from the smoking ceremony welcoming her to country. “It was very beautiful. I was very moved,” she says. “Then I got to know the incarceration rates for Aboriginal people and it was very shocking to me. I tried to educate myself about the things like land rights, constitutional voice and injustice.” Sofia Helin as Saga Noren in The Bridge.Credit:SBS Helin has enjoyed her relative anonymity on the streets of Broome, although a few locals have clocked her presence. It’s a similar vibe to Stockholm, she says, where “people like to play it cool. My husband sees people see me but I’m mostly pretty unaware of it. Or I try to be"". She could lay a WorkCover claim for cultural whiplash over such a fast immersion into the pointy end of Australian politics and Indigenous recognition but Helin has nothing but praise for her red-dust family. “This whole project has been a gift for me,” she says. “There is so much knowledge, the scripts are so brilliant and the team is so inspiring. This is something Australia should be proud of.” WHAT: Mystery Road (season two) WHEN: ABC, Sunday April 19, 8.30pm Larissa is a writer and reviewer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Dubecki ,"April 8, 2020"

Rachel Perkins directed the first season, while its follow-up unconventionally unites Warwick Thornton (Sweet Country; Samson and Delilah) and Wayne Blair (The Sapphires; Top End Wedding) as co-directors. A songlines approach to storytelling follows the season one lead, sending its protagonists in search of answers to a current mystery while crime in “deep time” presents layers of complexity exploring the tension between two cultures and their uneasy cohabitation. “I’m trying to rewrite history,” says Helin’s professor archaeologist chasing a globally significant discovery to the Indigenous protestors railing at her camp. “And you’re trying to destroy it all.” The current hot-button issue of the repatriation of indigenous artefacts to their rightful owners is a timely insinuation into the Mystery Road oeuvre. “It asks the questions, who is writing history? Why should white people do it, who owns these artefacts?” says Helin. “It’s complicated. The archaeologists argue they need to be taken care of. But why do we think we own them? We should give them back.” A first-time visitor to Australia, she was catapulted into the middle of our national conversation from the smoking ceremony welcoming her to country. “It was very beautiful. I was very moved,” she says. “Then I got to know the incarceration rates for Aboriginal people and it was very shocking to me. I tried to educate myself about the things like land rights, constitutional voice and injustice.” Sofia Helin as Saga Noren in The Bridge.Credit:SBS Helin has enjoyed her relative anonymity on the streets of Broome, although a few locals have clocked her presence. It’s a similar vibe to Stockholm, she says, where “people like to play it cool. My husband sees people see me but I’m mostly pretty unaware of it. Or I try to be"". She could lay a WorkCover claim for cultural whiplash over such a fast immersion into the pointy end of Australian politics and Indigenous recognition but Helin has nothing but praise for her red-dust family. “This whole project has been a gift for me,” she says. “There is so much knowledge, the scripts are so brilliant and the team is so inspiring. This is something Australia should be proud of.” WHAT: Mystery Road (season two) WHEN: ABC, Sunday April 19, 8.30pm Larissa is a writer and reviewer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Dubecki ,"April 8, 2020"

Homecoming for returned soldier US lieutenant Clint Lorance in documentary Leavenworth. At issue are the events of July 2, 2012, when a soldier under Lorance's command shot and killed the two men as they approached their patrol in a volatile area of Kandahar province. Though the soldier who pulled the trigger was not charged, Lorance would be tried by court martial for issuing the order and sentenced to 20 years' prison on two counts of second-degree murder. ""I was the Army's scapegoat,"" Lorance tells the camera while still confined in the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He portrays himself as having been unfairly convicted in order to shield the Army from Afghan political pressure about civilian casualties. But some of those who were under Lorance's command that day, and who testify against him at length here, maintain that it was plain murder. It's a bitter impasse that lasts the length of the series, and inevitably leaves the viewer unclear about what really happened. But the series, which is directed by Paul Pawlowski and counts Steven Soderbergh among its numerous producers, shines lights in various other areas – most of which serve to accentuate the tragedy of it all. ""Rural Oklahoma is about as miserable as rural Afghanistan,"" Lorance says drily of the places he grew up. His homosexuality wasn't going to be accepted in that milieu, and within the US Army it put him at risk of homophobic violence – even as it spurred him to surpass the achievements of his heterosexual peers. Having never experienced combat he certainly felt the need to prove himself when, just a few days before the shooting, he was unexpectedly made the leader of a close-knit, battle-hardened platoon. What's particularly interesting is hearing the members of that platoon talk of their sorrow about how the events of that day shattered everything they had worked and risked their lives for as their relationship with the local population soured and Taliban attacks resurged – it's easy for civilians to overlook soldiers' emotional investment in their missions.

These days, jokes grounded in sexism, homophobia and racism are no longer tolerated. So should those once-loved shows be wiped from the history books? That's the big question on the Televisionaries podcast this week. Bill Cosby was convicted of sexual assault offences in 2018.  Host Louise Rugendyke is joined by The Guide and Green Guide TV reviewer Debi Enker and culture editor-at-large Michael Idato to talk through the moral dilemma presented by problematic TV. ""It is a really tough call,"" Idato says. ""In the realm of un-PC comedies, like The Benny Hill Show, Dick Emery, Love Thy Neighbour, Are You Being Served? – some of those are genuinely hard to watch now."" The critics also consider if you can separate the art from the artist. Enker references comedian Bill Cosby's 2018 sexual assault convictions as she shares her point of view. ""I have trouble watching The Cosby Show without thinking about what was going on,"" she says. ""I cannot accept Dr Cliff Huxtable anymore as a benign, charming, wise, wonderful father figure because every time I see Bill Cosby on screen what I think about is what we've learnt subsequently. That fundamentally affects the way that I watch that show now."" Also up for discussion is the just-launched third season of Netflix thriller Ozark, starring Jason Bateman and Laura Linney. If you're yet to dive into this dark and twisted story, you've got three seasons to enjoy in self-isolation – but does the show get the thumbs up from our expert panel? ""I find the tension in this show at times almost unbearable,"" says Enker. ""[But] the combination of the crime drama and the domestic family drama really works for me ... it's a very tense and suspenseful series."" For Idato, the show straddles the line between two other well-loved crime dramas. ""I'm still not entirely sure whether I'm watching a really, really, really good Narcos or a sub-par Breaking Bad,"" he says, also introducing the concept of the ""sophomore slump"" to some objections from his fellow critics. Later in the show, Rugendyke, Enker and Idato deep dive into the TV vault and pull out The Wire, the 2000s crime drama starring Dominic West and Idris Elba. Is it one of those rare shows that stands the test of time? Tune in to The Televisionaries above to find out, and get involved in this week's game – keeping in theme, it's a quick-fire quiz about police shows. Can you beat the TV experts to the answers?

Christopher Penn gets some pointers from Kevin Bacon in Footloose.Credit:CBS I was not always good, and if Jesus wouldn't love me then why should I love him? There were so many other things to love – like television, like pop music, like Christopher Penn in Footloose, the way he looked so worried when Kevin Bacon was teaching him how to dance.

Not that there is any shame in succumbing to the virus. It's just that it feels far more appropriate for Blackman to have gone out in her own time, in her own way, karate-kicking every step. Honor Blackman, posing in publicity photograph for the film 'Goldfinger', circa 1964.Credit:Getty As Cathy Gale in the cult ’60s television series, The Avengers, Blackman hurled the submissive ’50s domestic goddess out of the kitchen window, supplanting her with a leather-clad female protagonist with brains, guts and endless, deadly legs. If there was a TV heroine who at long last reflected the more assertive role women had played during World War II, then Blackman (who starred in the series between 1962 and 1964) elegantly supplied her. Gale was an anthropologist who had married a farmer in Africa, where she learned to hunt, fight and take care of herself. Her husband had then died and Gale had returned to London to earn a PhD in anthropology and take up a position as a museum curator, before teaming up with secret agent John Steed (memorably played by Patrick Macnee). If reaction at the time was obsessed with the sexual liberation implied in her role - newspapers referred to the newly-minted star as a ""Sex Kitten in Black Boots"", ""blowing out picture tubes all over England"" - Blackman's lasting impact was as a poster woman for female liberation. Gale's boasting a doctorate and a profession was quite something back in 1962. Add to this poise, insouciant bravery and enviable judo prowess, and the role still felt radical 15 years on when I was watching after-school repeats as a six-year-old women's libber starved of role models. Looking to win wars in the playground, you could assume the part of Cathy Gale, while the boys claimed an infinite supply of superheroes. Not only would you win, you could be cool. The scenes may look dated to Gen Z viewers, but check out Blackman's moves! On more than one occasion, she managed to knock out actors playing opposite her when she didn't like the cut of their jib, including Tony Blair's future father-in-law, Tony Booth. Blackman left The Avengers to take her lethal, leather-clad mystique to film, in the guise of bisexual flying ace Pussy Galore in 1964's Goldfinger. Sean Connery's Bond may have ""cured"" Galore of her sapphism, but she was more than a match for him in terms of intelligence, wit and sexual appetite. No simpering damsel in distress she. Not only was the actress slightly older than Connery (as opposed to the usual Bond trope of being surrounded by nubile teens), she could hold her own both mentally and physically - and look amazing at the same time. Add Gale and Galore together, and Blackman became a proto-feminist icon. To put this in context, it was only in 1963 that Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique had been published, and several years until Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch would appear in 1970. Although Blackman was rewarded by a large postbag from male admirers, she received more fan mail from women, inspired by her portrayal of strong female characters who used every weapon in their arsenal to wield power over men. One critic described Gale as a ""safety valve for the rage felt by thousands of women at the fraud that appoints them the weaker sex"". Via Blackman, a template had been established for bruiser broads who might be screamingly sexy, but would no longer accept a screaming sidekick role. Blackman's successor on The Avengers, Diana Rigg's Emma Peel, was every bit as robust, self-assured, and down with fetish wear, while Connery's Bond went on to have mincemeat made out of him by the badass acrobat assailants Bambi and Thumper (Lola Larson and Trina Parks) in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Blackman also cleared the way for Honey West - the first American TV programme to feature a female detective's name in the title. West was intended to be the US version of Cathy Gale, and producer Aaron Spelling's first choice to play the part was Blackman, whom he had loved in both her leathered incarnations. Sadly, she turned it down, and the part was filled by Monroe look-a-like Anne Francis. West, referred to more than once as ""the private eyeful"", drove an AC Cobra convertible, boasted a pet ocelot, and kept a radio hidden in her lipstick case. Her wardrobe was animal print to match her racy apartment décor. Even Roger Vadim's so-ghastly-it-is-almost-unwatchable Barbarella of 1968 - championed as the first female sci-fi - owed its debt to Blackman; albeit this pancake-flat non-thriller hardly lives up to its inspiration. Barbarella may be a kitsch, leotard-clad action woman, but she is an other-worldly dolt compared with her predecessors, subject to thrashings and literally shooting herself in the foot. Still, even pouting, air-brained Barbarella proved that attitudes had changed, if not quite enough. In less than a decade, Cathy Gale's legacy had been felt on both sides of the Atlantic. In Doctor Who, the Doctor's companions, while always comely, were also combative: ardent feminist Sarah Jane Smith, brainbox Romana, and even cave woman Leela in her skimpy animal-skins. Charlie had his angels, police officers dissatisfied with being relegated to traffic and office roles, who took on a life of jumpsuits and blow dries. The Six Million Dollar Man was rivalled by The Bionic Woman, while 1972 Miss World USA Lynda Carter's Amazonian Wonder Woman may have looked good in a bustier, but was still adept at taking out Nazis. However, by the end of the Seventies times had changed and female crime fighters were no longer considered empowering if they were clad in a bikini. (The recent film Misbehaviour, which tells the real-life story of the 1970 Miss World competition, captures the beginnings of this change in attitude.) During the ’80s, with women in positions of authority an increasing fact rather than fantasy, realism took hold. And so we had a non-sexed up Gill Gascoigne in The Gentle Touch; Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly as New York cops Cagney & Lacey. Even Helen Mirren's stalwart Jane Tennision in Prime Suspect, and Gillian Anderson's Stella Gibson in The Fall owe something to Blackman's steel. As for the armies of female action heroines who have punched, kicked and jumped their way into cinemas since the downfall of Harvey Weinstein, some of them have even reclaimed the catsuit — witness Scarlett Johansson's Ghost in the Shell, Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, and Gal Gadot's forthcoming Wonder Woman 1984. Daisy Ridley's Star Wars heroine should be grateful for her Jedi robes. With their dogged determination and planet-sized attitude, these ball-breakers too fall into the glorious Gale mould. Let us high kick a salute to this sensational Sixties pioneer, as we bid fond farewell to her creator. The Telegraph, London Copyright © 2020", Hannah Betts ,"April 8, 2020"

18,/culture/movies/virtual-cinema-streams-on-theme-for-cloistered-film-buffs-20200408-p54i7k.html,Virtual cinema streams on theme for cloistered film buffs,"“Who would have thought that being closed already would be a positive?” says Katrina Sedgwick, director of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. In May 2019, ACMI shut down its Federation Square site for a major renovation, while continuing to present film screenings in other Melbourne venues such as the historic art deco Capitol theatre. Andrei Tarkovsky's transcendent science-fiction epic Solaris is playing in ACMI's virtual cinemateque. In the COVID-19 era, all such events are off the table, but “we’ve been in a good position to pivot”, Sedgwick says. ACMI’s screen education programs, aimed at both primary and secondary students, have in recent times been delivered mainly online, and can be accessed via the ACMI website by teachers, parents and other members of the public. Also continuing online are ACMI’s screen industry programs such as the Running Free series of skills workshops, with new videos uploaded every Wednesday and Friday to the ACMI YouTube channel. And what of the Melbourne Cinematheque, Australia’s largest film society, hosted by ACMI though run independently by volunteers? For many years, the Cinematheque has screened double features on Wednesday evenings, spanning the whole of cinema history and often showcasing rare imported 35-millimetre prints, as with the Marlene Dietrich season in progress in March when Melbourne's cinemas were shut down. For the city’s dedicated cinephiles, it’s a devastating loss. “There’s a big audience that comes together every Wednesday night,” says ACMI’s director of film programs Kristy Matheson, “and that’s a genuine community. And it’s a very ritualised community. So for that to stop very abruptly, it just doesn’t make any sense.” Andrei Tarkovsky's transcendent science-fiction epic Solaris was selected for this week's ACMI virtual cinemateque. In response, ACMI and the Cinematheque committee have joined forces to create what they are calling a “virtual” Cinematheque. Each Tuesday, they’re announcing a themed double bill of films which viewers in Australia can access via streaming, watch on Wednesday night (or in their own time) and discuss on social media using the hashtag #acmivirtualcteq. Accompanying critical writing has also been made available, again via the ACMI website. Without being too heavy-handed about it, the programmers have sought out films that resonate with current circumstances, kicking things off a fortnight ago with Offside and The White Balloon, both by the outspoken Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has effectively spent the past decade under house arrest. Next came two films from the fabled British team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, I Know Where I’m Going and A Matter of Life and Death, both made around the end of the Second World War, and both concerned with place and local community, as Cinematheque co-curator Adrian Danks points out. This week highlights the Soviet-era output of Russia’s fabled Mosfilm studio, pairing Andrei Tarkovsky’s science-fiction classic Solaris with the long-suppressed social realist drama The Story of Asya Klyachina, an early work by Tarkovsky’s sometime collaborator Andrei Konchalovsky, who would go on to an eclectic career including the Hollywood cop movie Tango and Cash. Admittedly, this virtual cinematheque is a far cry from watching films on the big screen in a public, communal space. “It is most definitely not a replacement for the Melbourne Cinematheque,” Danks says, “but an initiative that we hope will help people at this moment.” On the other hand, an advantage of online delivery is that participation, again, isn’t restricted to those in Melbourne. “If folks anywhere else in Australia want to join in the fun, they're warmly welcomed,” says Matheson. In the meantime, work continues on the renovations at ACMI’s Federation Square site, while Matheson and her team continue to plan the film programs to follow the reopening. Sedgwick notes that the arts and entertainment industries have been the “canary in the coalmine” where the COVID-19 shutdown is concerned. “We were the first that had to stop, in terms of our cinemas, our theatres, our music venues.” But equally, she says, the arts play a crucial role in holding the community together at a time like this, which, she emphasises, won’t last forever. “When we come out of our cocoons, ACMI is going to be this wonderful, new, free offer for the people of Victoria.” Jake Wilson is a film critic for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Like nothing the world has ever seen, this tiny bush sprouts small glowing berries that can turn back the hands of time and bring youth to whoever eats them. Through the award-winning premiere season of the Stan Original Series Bloom, we saw what could happen when people are given second chance to rewrite mistakes, leaving relationships, families and lives as collateral damage. And now, with the release of season two finally upon us, there are even bigger questions to explore. Do we have the right to live our lives over? Can we defy a universe that is set up to give us all a finite time? And what will happen when the rest of the world realises eternal youth is possible? “I think that we did ask those questions as an audience in the first season,” says Toby Schmitz who joins Bloom in the brand new season as Father John Melvin, a priest whose life is turned upside down when he witnesses the miracle of a life transformed by the berries. “The clever thing in season two is to have the characters who face those questions head on.” At the centre of this monumental struggle between right and wrong and religion and science, are once again Mullan locals Ray and Gwen Reed (played by Bryan Brown as Ray and a combination of Jacki Weaver and Phoebe Tonkin as the older and younger Gwen). The pair have been on the run for three months since Gwen ate the first berry and found herself back in the body she thought she had lost decades before. Now enjoying an energy and freedom she hasn’t known in years, she’s struggling to find a way to stay with Ray who is trapped in old age when the berries don’t work for him.  Credit:Stan They’re being chased by the mysterious businesswoman Anne Carter (Jacqueline McKenzie) who knows the secret Ray and Gwen are struggling to hide and wants the berries, for the untold commercial gains they might bring. And thrown into the mix is Father John, who suddenly finds everything he believes challenged by the berries’ promise. While Ray and Gwen continue to question and chase eternal youth, it’s the newcomers who find themselves providing the much-needed commentary on the bigger issues raised. “John, when we first meet him, has a faith in his religion,” Schmitz says, “while Jacqueline’s character has a deep faith in science. “And I find it really interesting that both of their instincts aren’t necessarily to just gobble a berry straight away. Both have bigger plans or bigger reasons than just wanting to go back to their youth and that’s interesting. They’re thinking about a bigger picture of what the berries could mean.’’ It’s that bigger picture, says series creator Glen Dolman, that will be explored in this new season. “I never wanted to definitively answer where this so-called ‘miracle’ comes from or why it’s happening but allow our characters to ponder its origin and meaning for themselves,” Dolman says.  Credit:Stan   “To me, that's the nature of life; we're all trying to make sense of our existence through whatever lens or framework we chose. We therefore introduced a person of science and of faith who both have to decide what this ‘miracle’ means to them.” The other great question of this season will be what happens when the world learns what has happened in Mullan. “Increasingly as you watch shows where suddenly everyone’s back from the dead or some miracle has occurred, there’s the greater question of when are the newspapers going to send a reporter to cover this, or why hasn’t anyone contacted the TV networks?” Schmitz says. It was important to answer those questions, Dolman said, because in the real world: “Word would get out.” “Naturally, most people wouldn’t believe it, but some might, especially if they had proof. And because we now have a new, ‘second generation’ berry, with different properties than the first, we were able to begin the story outside of Mullan with someone who’s already witnessed this.”  Credit:Stan And that, hints Schmitz, will be a whole new level for Bloom. “I think humans have always been fascinated by the question of living forever,” Schmitz says. ‘Fountain of Youth’ mythologies are rife through the narrative of all cultures. “I always think about Peter Pan, the boy who stayed young. And in his story there is Wendy who, eventually, chooses not to. “There’s something very powerful in asking, do you want to live forever, or would it actually be all it was cut out to be? Those are great questions and they’ve always been with us in our DNA.” The brand new season of the Stan Original Series Bloom is now streaming, only on Stan – Australia’s unrivalled home of original productions.

Those are great questions and they’ve always been with us in our DNA.” The brand new season of the Stan Original Series Bloom is now streaming, only on Stan – Australia’s unrivalled home of original productions.

Ignoring the clickbait, she decided to create a podcast talking people through the pain of separation. ""Because of the public nature of my divorce, so many people got in touch with me expecting me to have answers. And I don't have answers for anybody else. My experience was my experience,"" she says. Cass Thorburn (right) and her Divorce Story co-gost Annalise Dent. ""I don't have these answers for people, but maybe there should be a platform for psychologists and lawyers and experts to offer advice, to tell people you're not alone."" Thorburn believes giving listeners an audio life raft to cling to during this time is incredibly important. ""As we've learned in the podcast [chatting] with psychiatrists and psychologists, your frontal lobe is not really operating at its maximum potential... We can give information to people that they can really listen to at any stage and they can take notes and you can have family or friends that could listen to it and they might be able to help you make a list. It's emotionally and financially a very, very stressful time."" Thorburn sees podcasting as a way to communicate important issues, without the time constraints of modern media. If we stay in a job for 21 years, anyone would call that successful. So why is being in a relationship for 21 years not considered a success? ""We don't have long format interview shows anymore. The days of sitting and listening to a psychologist on a daytime TV show talk for 10 minutes and really explain something are long gone... And so you're really not getting an answer to a question that's not in a soundbite. ""Podcasts provide the platform for people to get an answer that's explained, and there's no rush, whatever the answer is, that’s how long we wait, before I ask the next question."" Thorburn hopes her podcast can help break down the shame and taboo that surrounds divorce. ""People have been breaking up for as long as we’ve been hooking up. For something so common, why is it still so taboo? It's because we've made it that way, as a society. There is a shame people feel for the marriage breaking down. And that's what’s preventing them from talking about it. ""I think if we stay in a job for 21 years, anyone would call that successful. So why is being in a relationship for 21 years [even if it ends in divorce] not considered a success? I've got three amazing children. I see that as a pretty successful relationship."" The most recent episode of Divorce Story has the catchy title How to co-parent in a Global Pandemic. In it, Thorburn talks with lawyer Lucy Mannering on the need to keep both parents involved during lock down. ""It's a scary time to everyone and it's time to be really caring to each other... It's really important to focus on making sure both parents still have their relationship with their children, even though we're in a situation where we're being told to stay home.""

From a camp cabaret to Easter hymns, we've got you covered. Make your Good Friday a great one and go for a digital trip to a famous New York venue for some cabaret and show tunes. Marie's Crisis is one of Greenwich Village's most beloved bars, renowned for hosting the biggest stars on Broadway who wander in and have a sing by the piano. With the venue closed and Broadway shuttered the pianists from the bar are doing regular live streams to keep them and us entertained through the crisis. Some do themed sets (the Andrew Lloyd Webber one was particularly memorable), some take requests, but it is always a rollicking good time and super camp. Find Marie's Crisis on Facebook and don't forget to leave a tip for the pianist.

This week it is Animal Collective co-founder Noah Lennox (aka Panda Bear) in his intimate Australian debut in the studio at the Opera House. Filmed live in 2018, the show will be available for a while. It's not a live gig as such but it's about the ultimate live gig.

Hitting angelic, echo-soaked high-notes while singing in what looked like a church, Gordi all but stole her own party in one fell swoop. Bigger names like New Yorker Brit Shura and Tennessee’s Julien Baker returned things to the nocturnal vibe of late-night, lovelorn laments, the latter highlighting the real-time nature of proceedings by mentioning the tragic, just-announced death of musician John Prine.

Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the targeted support is to help organisations stay afloat through the crisis and funnel money to some of the most-needed areas. Arts Minister Paul Fletcher.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen ""We understand the big impact this is having on them if performances have been called off, if venues are closed or if museums and art galleries are closed and you can't do what is your core business,"" Mr Fletcher said. ""What we are announcing today is specifically targeted measures where we think we can provide support to the arts sector."" Of the funding, $7 million will be delivered under the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program and $10 million will be delivered through Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund to assist artists and organisations in creating work and exploring new delivery methods. Support Act, the charity that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry, will receive $10 million. The organisation helps musicians, touring crew and others in the music industry through financial means, such as paying bills, but also operates a telephone counselling service. Earlier this week they reported a 400 per cent increase in calls since the industry shut down due to social distancing measures. Live Performance Australia, the advocacy body for the live performing industry, and a coalition of live music promoters have called on the government for a $850 million support and stimulus package for the industry. The government has come under persistent criticism from members of the arts community who believe the industry is on the brink of a crisis and needs a financial lifeline. Labor amendments to the JobKeeper subsidy bill, including one targeting the arts and entertainment sector, failed on Wednesday. The JobKeeper and JobSeeker allowances have gone some way to solving some issues, and Mr Fletcher said the work would continue.

Arts Minister Paul Fletcher said the targeted support is to help organisations stay afloat through the crisis and funnel money to some of the most-needed areas.

""What we are announcing today is specifically targeted measures where we think we can provide support to the arts sector."" Of the funding, $7 million will be delivered under the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program and $10 million will be delivered through Regional Arts Australia's regional arts fund to assist artists and organisations in creating work and exploring new delivery methods. Support Act, the charity that provides financial support and counselling to people in the music industry, will receive $10 million. The organisation helps musicians, touring crew and others in the music industry through financial means, such as paying bills, but also operates a telephone counselling service.

40,/culture/music/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-from-covid-19-complications-20200408-p54i87.html,Country folk singer John Prine dies from COVID-19 complications,"John Prine, the raspy-voiced country-folk singer whose ingenious lyrics to songs by turns poignant, angry and comic made him a favourite of Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson and others, has died aged 73. The cause was complications from COVID-19, his family said. Prine underwent cancer surgery in 1998 to remove a tumour in his neck identified as squamous cell cancer, which had damaged his vocal cords. In 2013, he had part of one lung removed to treat lung cancer. He died on Tuesday at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre in Nashville, Tennessee. Prine was a relative unknown in 1970 when Kristofferson heard him play one night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg, dragged there by singer-songwriter Steve Goodman. Kristofferson was performing in Chicago at the time at the Quiet Knight. At the Fifth Peg, Prine treated him to a brief after-hours performance of material that, Kristofferson later wrote, ""was unlike anything I'd heard before.""

""No way somebody this young can be writing so heavy,"" he said. ""John Prine is so good, we may have to break his thumbs."" Record executive Jerry Wexler, who was in the audience, signed Prine to a contract with Atlantic Records the next day. Music writers at the time were eager to crown a successor to Dylan, and Prine, with his nasal, sandpapery voice and literate way with a song, came ready to order. His debut album, called simply John Prine and released in 1971, included songs that became his signatures. Some gained wider fame after being recorded by other artists.

""He's a true folk singer in the best folk tradition, cutting right to the heart of things, as pure and simple as rain,"" Raitt told Rolling Stone in 1992. Dylan, listing his favourite songwriters for The Huffington Post in 2009, put Prine front and centre. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism,"" he said. ""Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs."" John Prine was born Oct. 10, 1946, in Maywood, Illinois, a working-class suburb of Chicago, to William and Verna (Hamm) Prine. His father, a tool-and-die maker at American Can Co., and his mother had moved from the coal town of Paradise, Kentucky, in the 1930s. Prine later wrote a ruefully bitter song titled Paradise, in which he sang: The coal company came with the world's largest shovel  And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land  Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man John grew up in a country music-loving family. He learned guitar as a young teenager from his grandfather and brother and began writing songs. After graduating from high school, he worked for the post office for two years before being drafted into the Army, which sent him to West Germany in charge of the motor pool at his base. After being discharged, he resumed his mail route, in and around his hometown, composing songs in his head. ""I always likened the mail route to a library with no books,"" he wrote on his website. ""I passed the time each day making up these little ditties."" Reluctantly, he took the stage for the first time at an open-mic night at the Fifth Peg, where his performance of Hello in There and Angel From Montgomery met with profound silence from the audience. ""They just sat there,"" Prine wrote. ""They didn't even applaud; they just looked at me."" Then the clapping began. ""It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions,"" he wrote. ""And to find that out all at once was amazing."" Not long after, Roger Ebert, the film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, wandered into the club while Prine was performing. He liked what he heard and wrote Prine's first review, under the headline Singing Mailman Who Delivers a Powerful Message in a Few Words. ""He appears onstage with such modesty he almost seems to be backing into the spotlight,"" Ebert wrote. ""He sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn't show off. He starts slow. But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you."" Prine had a particular gift for offbeat humour, reflected in songs like Jesus, the Missing Years, Some Humans Ain't Human, Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone and the anti-war screed Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore. ""I guess what I always found funny was the human condition,"" he told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph in 2013. ""There is a certain comedy and pathos to trouble and accidents."" John Prine in his office in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2017.Credit:AP/Mark Humphrey After recording several albums for Atlantic and Asylum, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, in 1984. He never had a hit record, but he commanded a loyal audience that ensured steady if modest sales for his albums and a durable concert career. In 1992, his album The Missing Years, with guest appearances by Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty and other artists, won a Grammy Award for best contemporary folk recording. He received a second Grammy in the same category in 2006 for the album Fair and Square. Prine, who lived in Nashville, was divorced twice. He is survived by his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, a native of Ireland whom he married in 1996; three sons, Jody, Jack and Tommy; two brothers, Dave and Billy; and three grandchildren. In 2017, Prine published John Prine Beyond Words, a collection of lyrics, guitar chords, commentary and photographs from his own archive. In 2019, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and his album Tree of Forgiveness was nominated for a Grammy, for best Americana album. It was his 19th album and his first of original material in more than a decade. Prine went on tour in 2018 to promote Tree of Forgiveness,  and after a two-night stand at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville — known there as the mother church of country music — Margaret Renkl, a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, wrote, under the headline ""American Oracle"": ""The mother church of country music, where the seats are scratched-up pews and the windows are stained glass, is the place where the new John Prine — older now, scarred by cancer surgeries, his voice deeper and full of gravel — is most clearly still the old John Prine: mischievous, delighting in tomfoolery, but also worried about the world.""

Enter stage right Lara Worthington, but more on her later. Lara and Sam Worthington.Credit:Lisa Maree Williams Exactly what is it that makes social media transgressions worthy of the sort of Twitter/Instagram/Facebook pile-ons that have accompanied this hideous global pandemic? As celebrity foodie Lyndey Milan admitted, after she dared to complain about the carb-heavy diet she had to eat while under forced quarantine at the Sydney Hilton, which resulted in a deluge of criticism, ""I guess I have to toughen up, it was the first time I had ever been trolled"". Well yes, and she agrees that in hindsight, perhaps complaining about carbs during a global pandemic was slightly off key, though not quite a hanging offence. Lyndey Milan has copped her first trolling experience on social media. With a police guard stationed outside her hotel door, Milan says she started her isolation diary on Instagram because she ""thought it would be a good idea given it was a pretty unusual situation we found ourselves in"". ""I did have a lot of positive reactions too... and I certainly don't regret doing the diary, if anything it actually improved things for us and all the others in this situation. We were able to be heard,"" Milan explained, as reports surfaced of entire families being crammed into hotel rooms eating cold stodge and unable to order in supplies. ""I think it's very easy to make a comment on social media without too much thought into the person you are commenting on. We're the ones forced to stay in a hotel room for two weeks. Who cares how many stars it has, it's not like we're lazing by the pool!"" ""Of course we understand why we have to be here, but in here trying to keeping things going too, trying to salvage our own business, look after our 50 staff and keep sane. None of this is easy ... for anyone."" Last week I wrote about a group of wealthy Sydney women who posted glamorous shots from their swanky lunch at Catalina in Rose Bay just hours before Prime Minister Scott Morrison banned such gatherings. Decked out in designer finery, complete with expensive watches and jewels, they hashtagged the post #lastsupper and #beforelockdown. Last supper:  Sydney's ladies who lunch in pre-lockdown at Rose Bay's Catalina, from left Elaine Kwan, Maude Tzaneros, Barbara Coombes, unknown,  Laura Ibrahim, Elle Touma and Hannah Toohey.Credit:Instagram  It went down like a lead balloon. Readers were gobsmacked at their timing, given reports of people dying by their thousands around the world, while here hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost jobs as the economy teeters on the brink of collapse. Clearly, this is no time to be bragging about flash lunch dates. While these women are relative ""nobodies"" in the grand social pecking order, their story was one of the biggest of the week. Just as the images of an unidentified man swimming at Bronte Beach -  despite it being closed - became headline news. That man was Sydney film producer Marcus Gillezeau. He was widely condemned for his actions and comments that it was ""my beach"", all captured for the masses to pass judgement on and quickly going viral on social media. By comparison, Lara Worthington is far from being a nobody, having been tabloid fodder ever since she strutted in her bikini and mouthed those infamous words ""where the bloody hell are you?"". Armed with her smartphone and social media platforms, the former ""it girl"", who now lives in a multi-million-dollar Hollywood mansion with her actor husband Sam Worthington, sparked ridicule after she shared the ""plight"" of her mother Sharon Bingle. Mumma Bingle had been forced to endure the hardships of a 4-star hotel in Newtown, one of thousands of returning Australians forcibly quarantined. “I don’t think this looks like a 5 star accommodation to me,” Lara wrote on Twitter alongside four images of the The Urban Newtown hotel in Sydney. “The next 14 days here for my 63-year-old mum who is showing heavy symptoms. This is unacceptable.” Within minutes she was accused of being ""tone deaf"", with countless comments suggesting she ""go check your privilege"". Later Sharon Bingle, who did not elaborate on those supposed ""heavy symptoms"",  went on the defence. She accused detractors of trolling her daughter and the media of ""lying"" about her, ahem, ordeal, and went into detail about her decor and lack of cushions. At least one of Sharon's pals was listening, with Yvonne Tozzi posting a ""Help! SOS"" notice on her Instagram feed with a photo of her friend in a face mask. Heartbreaking stuff. Indeed, it was worthy of its own hashtag: #PrayforSharon. Andrew Hornery is a senior journalist and Private Sydney columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald.

""Of course we understand why we have to be here, but in here trying to keeping things going too, trying to salvage our own business, look after our 50 staff and keep sane. None of this is easy ... for anyone."" Last week I wrote about a group of wealthy Sydney women who posted glamorous shots from their swanky lunch at Catalina in Rose Bay just hours before Prime Minister Scott Morrison banned such gatherings. Decked out in designer finery, complete with expensive watches and jewels, they hashtagged the post #lastsupper and #beforelockdown. Last supper:  Sydney's ladies who lunch in pre-lockdown at Rose Bay's Catalina, from left Elaine Kwan, Maude Tzaneros, Barbara Coombes, unknown,  Laura Ibrahim, Elle Touma and Hannah Toohey.Credit:Instagram  It went down like a lead balloon. Readers were gobsmacked at their timing, given reports of people dying by their thousands around the world, while here hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost jobs as the economy teeters on the brink of collapse. Clearly, this is no time to be bragging about flash lunch dates. While these women are relative ""nobodies"" in the grand social pecking order, their story was one of the biggest of the week. Just as the images of an unidentified man swimming at Bronte Beach -  despite it being closed - became headline news. That man was Sydney film producer Marcus Gillezeau. He was widely condemned for his actions and comments that it was ""my beach"", all captured for the masses to pass judgement on and quickly going viral on social media. By comparison, Lara Worthington is far from being a nobody, having been tabloid fodder ever since she strutted in her bikini and mouthed those infamous words ""where the bloody hell are you?"". Armed with her smartphone and social media platforms, the former ""it girl"", who now lives in a multi-million-dollar Hollywood mansion with her actor husband Sam Worthington, sparked ridicule after she shared the ""plight"" of her mother Sharon Bingle. Mumma Bingle had been forced to endure the hardships of a 4-star hotel in Newtown, one of thousands of returning Australians forcibly quarantined. “I don’t think this looks like a 5 star accommodation to me,” Lara wrote on Twitter alongside four images of the The Urban Newtown hotel in Sydney. “The next 14 days here for my 63-year-old mum who is showing heavy symptoms. This is unacceptable.” Within minutes she was accused of being ""tone deaf"", with countless comments suggesting she ""go check your privilege"". Later Sharon Bingle, who did not elaborate on those supposed ""heavy symptoms"",  went on the defence. She accused detractors of trolling her daughter and the media of ""lying"" about her, ahem, ordeal, and went into detail about her decor and lack of cushions. At least one of Sharon's pals was listening, with Yvonne Tozzi posting a ""Help! SOS"" notice on her Instagram feed with a photo of her friend in a face mask. Heartbreaking stuff. Indeed, it was worthy of its own hashtag: #PrayforSharon. Andrew Hornery is a senior journalist and Private Sydney columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald.

""You like?"" Images from Nissy Nassif's Instagram page showing her and husband Jean Nassif and her prized yellow Lamborghini.Credit:Instagram The frock, worth between $2000 and $3000, was a ""thank you"" gift from Lebanese-raised Nassif, who told PS she had been the victim of a hate campaign in the media: ""I don't know why, is it because of my accent or people are jealous of my life?"" Nissy had finally been treated to glowing coverage after Nsenduluka wrote a particularly florid dispatch about the mother-of-three with a penchant for bling and showy cars when she turned up to her publicist Sophie Muir's 30th birthday party. Nsenduluka gushed in print: ""ALL eyes were on Sydney socialite Nissy Nassif as she made a grand arrival at a VIP bash over the weekend. Guests partying at PR maven Sophie Muir’s 30th birthday couldn’t believe their eyes as the glamorous CEO of Wiping Tears Charitable Foundation rocked up in her famous yellow Lamborghini which previously went viral on social media. Confidential witnessed impressed onlookers recording Nassif’s show-stopping entrance at the swanky soiree, which was held at a $50 million beachfront home in Elizabeth Bay."" Grateful: Mibenge Nsenduluka.Credit:Instagram Pass the bucket. Oddly, Nsenduluka made no mention of hubby Jean Nassif's arrest for cocaine possession at The Star, which was also reported by The Daily Telegraph just weeks ago, or that the Nassifs are embroiled in an ugly legal stoush with Channel Seven over its reporting which scrutinised their charitable pursuits. They were due to enter into mediation with the broadcaster last month. Following PS's inquiries, Nsenduluka and The Daily Telegraph editor Ben English issued statements yesterday. Nsenduluka admitted she now ""recognised I made a mistake"" by accepting the dress. ""I have returned the dress as a result. I've also been reprimanded for this error and I've learnt my lesson.'' English added: ""The Daily Telegraph has strict guidelines on the acceptance of gifts. This line was clearly crossed, and we've reinforced to the reporter how important it is to observe these guidelines."" The paper limits such gifts to the value of $100.

POSITIVE feedback and criticism mean a lot to me at this stage after all I've been through. ""Your article was the very first positive article written about me in The Daily. For that I'd like to thank you by sending you this small present, a Balmain dress similar to the one I was wearing at Sophie's 30th (the one you liked)."" An emotional Nassif burst into tears when PS asked if the frock was payment for favourable coverage. ""It is not a bribe, it's a thank you gift. Oh my god! I'll tell you what a bribe is. A bribe is when someone is offered money in an envelope to write nasty, horrible things about someone, that's what a bribe is,"" she helpfully explained. While she refused to reveal the cost of the dress - which still had its tags hanging off it - she informed PS: ""I had two of the dresses in my wardrobe.

So sweet and nice she forgot – or neglected – to mention her husband's recent cocaine arrest and being banned from The Star? ""Why are you focusing on such nasty things?

In October Nassif pleaded guilty at Downing Centre Local Court to the possession of a prohibited drug. No conviction was recorded due to his good character and the judge gave him an 18-month conditional release order. A year ago the Nassifs were in the news after reportedly ""flaunting"" a yellow Lamborghini he had bought his wife, posting a video on social media presenting the expensive car to his wife saying ""Congratulations Mrs Nassif … you like?"" The video inspired many memes featuring the ""you like"" line, but showcasing everything from yellow wheelie bins to toy trucks. She was so traumatised by the response, it reportedly took Nissy Nassif several months before she had the strength to get behind the wheel of the $480,000 vehicle. Billionaire Gina Rinehart. It is unclear if Australia's richest human Gina Rinehart had been on board the floating gated community for the super rich that is The World, which has been anchored off Fremantle over the past week or so. PS was offered a firm ""no comment"" from the billionaire's offices this week when asked about her location and how she was responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her fellow Perth mining mogul Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest has been doing the breakfast TV rounds trumpeting his efforts to secure surgical masks and ventilators from China. Rinehart is one of several Australian silvertails with suites aboard The World, which also counts Ros Packer among its well-heeled cargo. Normally the ship chugs its way around the planet on an endless cruise, but its 165 apartments are empty and dormant as management attempts to navigate through the stormy waters of the coronavirus crisis which has put a serious tarnish on the cruising industry's image. James Packer has been riding out the COVID-19 crisis in the luxury of his Aspen compound, where he has spent the past six weeks with his girlfriend Kylie Lim and his close pal Ben Tilley by his side. Friends rejected reports he had been bobbing about the South Pacific aboard his new $200 million tinnie, informing PS this week he was more preoccupied by the fate of his 18,000 casino staff who have been stood down in recent weeks. Packer's three children remain in Los Angeles with his former wife Erica, and the billionaire is said to be in a much better place emotionally, with his appearance before a public hearing into probity and licensing issues involving his Crown Resorts and Hong Kong casino group Melco postponed indefinitely due to coronavirus concerns.

PS hears Sydney's ""injecting rooms"", or at least the ones devoted to the trout pout and tight-as-a-drum foreheads, were inundated in the days before Monday's midnight curfew. However some of the more astute operators had put down their needles well before then. ""I decided over a week ago that it was best for everyone to close until the situation had improved, I don't want to risk staff or clients in any way,"" Dr Joseph Hkeik from Double Bay's All Saints Clinic told PS. ""Our work is not as drastic as what you might see on some people, we really try to keep aim for a natural look ... rather than the over-inflated lips and faces you often see. They are the ones who will notice a big difference in a few months' time."" Sydney's ""The Doll Maker"", Dr Naomi McCullum. Dr Naomi McCullum, known around town as ""The Doll Maker"", said she had taken similar measures at her The Manse clinics. ""In a few months the Sydney socialites are going to look very different. There will be frown lines, crow's feet, small lips and no cheeks everywhere ... I can't even picture everyone going back to natural. We're definitely going to need more Facetune than usual!"" she declared to PS. On a more serious note, she said she had redeployed her clinic's doctors to work as a regular GP clinic during the health crisis. ""This is the biggest public health challenge we've seen in generations. Redeployment in medicine is going to become common, doctors are going to have to make use of their experience and expertise where it's needed most."" What surgical mask shortage? It certainly didn't look like much of a shortage judging by the display at recently-opened Double Bay pharmacy Abundance X10 Longevity, which has drawn quite a bit of attention with the huge amount of stock for sale. Visionary: Double Bay pharmacist Ibrahim Azam.Credit:Instragram When PS visited, the pharmacy was selling 50 masks for $200 a box, along with large vats of hand sanitiser. By the end of the week there was still plenty on offer. Turns out the new pharmacy is owned by Ibrahim Azam, who calls himself a visionary on his Facebook page and is a devotee of the walking-on-burning-coals self help guru Anthony Robbins. Azam was also in the bridal party for disgraced former Auburn councillor Salim Mehajer's self-proclaimed ""wedding of the century"". Sadly Azam did not return PS's calls so we are unable to discover exactly how he got hold of such a prized haul, or if he has any contacts in the toilet paper world.

Nine has divided its staff into red and blue teams, alternating between each during the health crisis to restrict the potential spread of COVID-19.

But soon she expects to be lining up for welfare, along with most of her colleagues, after falling through the cracks of the government’s coronavirus support package. With JobKeeper about to be set in statute the federal government has confirmed the lifeline payments will not be available to freelancers and casuals on short-term contracts, or who have worked for a series of employers in the last year. Actor Nadine Garner lost her most recent job when MTC's Emerald City production was shuttered just days into its six-week run.Credit:Justin McManus And that’s pretty much the definition of acting work. It’s going to hurt, says Garner, a single mother with children aged 10 and 14. “I don’t have any friends in the arts sector who have nest eggs,” she says. “We might have a couple of weeks’ wages in the bank.” In a fact sheet issued on Sunday, the Treasury said JobKeeper payments would only go to casual employees who have been with their employer “on a regular and systematic basis for at least the previous 12 months”. The government resisted demands to include more casuals in JobKeeper, reportedly due to the added cost to the scheme. Instead, these casuals would have to apply for the JobSeeker payment, which has seen changes including expanded access criteria, reduced means testing and a Coronavirus supplement. Even applying for the JobSeeker payment could be fraught, says Garner. She has looked at welfare before but “I spend my life looking for the box I’m meant to tick on forms,"" she says. “It doesn’t exist.” “They look at you like you’re crazy because the rate you charge as an employee is quite high – if I’m paid X thousands for a few days’ work why am I applying for assistance? But it might be my only two days of work in six months.” Garner lost her most recent job abruptly when the Melbourne Theatre Company production of Emerald City she was starring in was shuttered by the coronavirus just days into a six-week run. She is hugely grateful to the MTC for paying an extra two weeks of her contract, but it still represents a big whack of lost income. She has also worked for Channel Seven, Sydney Theatre Company, Perth Theatre Company, ABC and ABC Radio. But she goes on the payroll for the life of a production, then goes off again, with no maternity leave or holiday pay - or much superannuation. “There’s a misunderstanding that maybe someone like myself is somehow on a rolling income – we’re in the mind’s eye, they think ‘yes she’s always working’. “We’re all on a very high wire, even people with very solid and lofty profiles are often living hand to mouth.” She doesn’t think there is “ill intent or malice” in the government's omission of support for actors in JobSeeker. But she warns there will be consequences. “There’s always a low-level mental health crisis in my sector,” she says. “It’s peaking at the moment. There’s no certainty the arts sector can pull through this. What is going to be left when we crawl out of our holes? The sector will be in rack and ruin. And it will have taken a pandemic to show you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone.” Garner joined other artists on Tuesday drawing attention to their plight. Director John Bell warned the country could lose a “whole generation of talent”, and actor Richard Roxburgh said the industry was on the brink of collapse. “We need to make sure that, after this pandemic has passed, Australia still has a voice.

60,/culture/art-and-design/artists-to-make-sydney-train-stations-their-canvas-20200408-p54i6z.html,Artists to make Sydney train stations their canvas,"NSW artists have been invited to create artworks for station entrances to the new metro line from Sydenham to Bankstown. Ten artists or artist groups will be selected for 10 paid commissions of up to $25,000 each to create semi-transparent works embedded in glass panels at each of the new stations that are due to open in 2024. Public artwork installed at the Kellyville  Metro Station. The opportunities were announced as the state liberal government called for expressions of interest to build the Sydney Metro West tunnels. The first art project for Sydney Metro, Light Line Social Square, was designed for the Sydney Metro's north-west line by Turpin+Crawford Studio and McGregor Westlake Architects in conjunction with station architects Hassell. Public art was integrated into the architecture and landscape of all eight stations from Tallawong to Cherrybrook, with sculptural art also commissioned for entrance foyers, concourses, lower-level platforms and escalator voids of the underground Metro stations Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street, Central and Waterloo. Khaled Sabsabi, an award-winning western Sydney artist, has developed a large sculptural artwork for Barangaroo concourse. Rose Nolan, a Melbourne artist whose work has transformed Melbourne trams as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival, has been commissioned to produce public art as part of the Sydney Metro works at Central Station. The budget for these integrated sculptural works at each of these stations was between $850,000 and $2,350,000. Each of the 10 selected artists on the Bankstown line will be paid an artist fee of $20,000 to $25,000 – depending on the size and number of glass panels required, with Sydney Metro to bear costs of technical development, prototypes, materials, approval, and construction. The 10 stations are: Marrickville, Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park, Canterbury, Campsie, Belmore Park, Wiley Park, Lakemba, Punchbowl and Bankstown. Arts and Aboriginal Affairs minister Don Harwin said there would be a focus on First Nations artists for Canterbury and Punchbowl stations. ""Given the current circumstances, this is an opportune time for artists to be involved with paid commissions that will breathe creative and cultural life into stations, with works that will be experienced by so many on a daily basis,"" he said. Concepts are to be presented in two-dimensional form including painting, drawing, photography or digital artwork. A designer will work with each of the artists to ensure station function requirements are met and be responsible for the preparation of final digital packages for glass printer fabrication. Expressions of interest are open until May 5, with successful artists notified in August.

Ten artists or artist groups will be selected for 10 paid commissions of up to $25,000 each to create semi-transparent works embedded in glass panels at each of the new stations that are due to open in 2024. Public artwork installed at the Kellyville  Metro Station. The opportunities were announced as the state liberal government called for expressions of interest to build the Sydney Metro West tunnels. The first art project for Sydney Metro, Light Line Social Square, was designed for the Sydney Metro's north-west line by Turpin+Crawford Studio and McGregor Westlake Architects in conjunction with station architects Hassell. Public art was integrated into the architecture and landscape of all eight stations from Tallawong to Cherrybrook, with sculptural art also commissioned for entrance foyers, concourses, lower-level platforms and escalator voids of the underground Metro stations Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street, Central and Waterloo. Khaled Sabsabi, an award-winning western Sydney artist, has developed a large sculptural artwork for Barangaroo concourse. Rose Nolan, a Melbourne artist whose work has transformed Melbourne trams as part of the Melbourne International Arts Festival, has been commissioned to produce public art as part of the Sydney Metro works at Central Station. The budget for these integrated sculptural works at each of these stations was between $850,000 and $2,350,000.

The good news is relief is in sight, as major cultural institutions adapt kids' programs and activities for online delivery. The Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney is launching an arts activity program pitched at children aged between four and 12, with older kids able to do the activities unsupervised. Pip Hall, who is running a children's activity program for the MCA, with her  twin boys, Vincent and Nolan, 6.Credit:Janie Barrett The museum's public engagement manager Yael Filipovic said the program aimed to keep children connected during a period when they're unable to see their friends. ""We know it's probably quite a challenging time and parents are still finding their feet so we hope we can offer a bit of respite,"" she said. The first activity in the program will be getting participating children to create a pouch out of recycled material, such as an old T-shirt. The pouch will then be used to hold the other objects kids will make throughout the week. ""We hope we can create a meaningful way for kids to be spending their time and parents can feel supported,"" Ms Filipovic said. Pip Hall is helping coordinate the program and with twin six-year-old boys she knows all about the difficulty of juggling working from home with parenting. ""It’s definitely been hard work, I'm not going to lie,"" Ms Hall said. ""For children this has been the hardest thing ever – all of a sudden school has been taken away, their mates have been taken away."" She's hoping families engage with the program, which begins on April 20, and share their creations on a new Facebook page to inspire other families.

The activities are based on the Biennale of Sydney, which is taking place online until June. Ms Filipovic says the theme ""better together"" couldn't be more appropriate in these circumstances.

Tara Moss' The Cobra Queen focuses on the New York Met.   The Cobra QueenTara MossEcho, $29.99  Credit:  Tara Moss’ Pandora English series is like a cross between Charmed and The Devil Wears Prada and is a fun idea for a super-camp genre-mashup. In The Cobra Queen, Pandora has long since discovered she has witchy powers and a unique destiny – one that quite possibly involves saving the world from an army of the dead. She’s not entirely unready. Pandora has received some tutelage from her eccentric Aunt Celia, and she’s even pursued romance with a dishy dead dude. Meanwhile, supernatural evil keeps rising among New York’s elite: a new exhibition at the Met, featuring the mummified remains of a female pharaoh, proves the latest threat. Sure, it’s breathless airport fiction, but no one’s reading it for style – it’s the frivolous blend of fashion and fangs, catwalks and cantrips that fans have come to enjoy. PICK OF THE WEEKImprovementJoan SilberAtlantic, $27.99  Credit:  Save a spot on your lockdown reading list for Improvement, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award in the US. It takes shape through a delicate weave of interconnected stories, all reverberating from one fateful decision. Reyna – a single mother from Harlem, whose boyfriend Boyd is on probation – is faced with a choice when he needs her help, this time with a shady scheme that involves smuggling cigarettes across state lines. What she chooses, and the butterfly-effect consequences for a range of characters, is revealed within an intricate, often tangential narrative structure, allowing scope for digression, including an elaborate set-piece in Turkey with Reyna’s eccentric aunt Kiki. There’s a steely inevitability to the sentences, a generosity to the way it explores connections between people, and the vision of human frailty and human endurance is wrought with a precision that lends weight to those US critics who would claim Joan Silber as their country’s Alice Munro. This Mournable BodyTsitsi DangarembgaFaber & Faber, $29.99  Credit:  In this companion piece to her 1988 novel, Nervous Conditions, Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangaremba returns to the character of Tambu. In 1970s Rhodesia, Tambu was a defiant girl driven by a burning desire to be educated, but by the 1990s, her fate in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, leaves her education betrayed. Tambu is unemployed, and soon evicted from her hostel into a dysfunctional city where corruption and social instability are rampant. Her shrinking opportunities propel a descent into poverty and despair, and she’s reduced to the degrading job of working for her white schoolmate’s eco-tourism business, organising women in her former village to perform “traditional African culture”. Betrayals and humiliations lie in wait at every turn, and the author mines an endless seam of tragicomic absurdity, in this richly imagined postcolonial fiction. Return TicketJohn DoustFremantle Press, $29.99  Credit:  Return Ticket is the third book from the Western Australian author to feature Jack Muir, first introduced in the semi-autobiographical boarding school novel, Boy On A Wire. Jack appears this time as an old man, with the narrative revealing his years of travel, misadventure and romance as a younger one. It begins with the protagonist washing dishes, which he does with a peculiar intensity, and proceeds to unfold in short chapters a story that takes us from Perth to South Africa under apartheid in the 1970s and then to an Israeli kibbutz where he meets his future wife. It’s vivid and episodic, memoir-like fiction, refreshingly free of pretension, that brings together the sharp observational style of the best travel-writing and the clipped voice of a character who’s repeated more than a few years at the school of hard knocks.   PICK OF THE WEEKRustEliese Colette GoldbachQuercus, $32.99  Credit:  The rust refers to the Cleveland steel mills. Ohio. Rust-belt country. Trump country. From the most unlikely material, Eliese Goldbach –Cleveland born and former mill worker – creates a vivid picture of the place, like being led into the molten belly of the beast itself. It’s memoir but it can read like dirty realist fiction –and it’s all true. She was brought up by catholic, Republican parents, dreamed of being a nun and escaping Cleveland, but a series of traumatic events, including rape and a bi-polar diagnosis, plunged her into a rediscovery of her rust-belt home. Woven into her tales of family, the dangers of the mill and her own story, is the rise of Trump: her parents and Cleveland voting for him, Goldbach appalled. This is surely written and rings with authenticity and understanding. The Future of UsLiz AllenNewSouth, $29.99  Credit:  One of the pivotal years in this study of Australian population patterns – from the first nation migration wave, the colonial era, through to the post-war boom years and the current migrant intakes – is a year that hasn’t happened yet: 2040. Liz Allen, a demographer who relishes her job, suggests a number of scenarios – from a declining, old population putting pressure on national resources to deliver quality of life, to an increased one due to national ‘‘fertility’’ and migration. But the ghost of White Australia still haunts the national psyche and we need to overcome our ‘‘fear of change (and) embrace immigration wholeheartedly’’. Demography and its accumulated data can provide a map for the future, but, at the same time, Allen concedes that what we count and how we count – needs a makeover. Statistics and charts can be dry, but this is a lively, conversational study. Heart of ViolencePaul ValentArden, $44  Credit:  When Hitler was young and subject to continual beatings from his dictatorial father, the family doctor recommended he receive psychological treatment in Vienna, probably from Freud. It’s not only one of those ‘‘what ifs’’ of history, but, for Paul Valent – a psychiatrist, traumatologist and Holocaust survivor – a synoptic shot of the heart of violence. He puts bullying, domestic violence and rape through to the mass violence of regimes and dictators on the couch, a pervasive theme running through all being the nexus between lovelessness and violence. In one section he examines Bill Buford’s study of soccer hooliganism, the crowd violence giving a tribal sense of belonging and meaning to men usually from broken homes. Other key concerns involve the functions of the left and right sides of the brain in a study that is at times a bit too all embracing, but is intriguing, relevant and readable. The Future We ChooseChristiana Figueres & Tom Rivett-CarnacManilla Press, $27.99  Credit:  While the world is focused on the current crisis, this combination of polemic and action handbook reminds us of that other crisis – climate change. The authors, part of the UN effort during the Paris climate negotiations, maintain that this is the crucial decade before it’s too late. Two dates, they say, must be seared into our minds: 2030, by when global emissions must be halved, and 2050, when the planet should have reached net zero emissions – no longer emitting more greenhouse gases than earth can absorb. Denying climate change, they say, is like denying gravity, and they provide a list of practical things to be done at the loca level to help overcome the sense of powerlessness people can feel when confronted with the enormity of the issue. It’s not an alarmist tract, rather a hopeful one. But it is a deeply informed wake-up call. Copyright © 2020"," Cameron Woodhead , Steven Carroll ","April 10, 2020"

66,/culture/books/greek-tragedy-novelist-polly-samson-dives-into-charmian-clift-s-world-20200402-p54gft.html,Greek tragedy: Novelist Polly Samson dives into Charmian Clift's world,"The English author admits to 'an almighty crush' on the celebrated Australian writer whose writing, fabled life and mystique have swept her away. By Ginny Dougary Polly Samson in Hydra. On October 10, 2016, The New Yorker printed an interview by its editor, David Remnick, with a fast-fading but still spirited Leonard Cohen. A month later, the sad news hit the world that the Canadian singer-songwriter had died. In that valedictory encounter, the two men talked about Cohen’s last letter to his old love Marianne Ihlen, on her own death bed three short months earlier, and how the tender words to her had been shared many times around the world since. Cohen was overtaken, Remnick wrote, by the memory of the couple’s time together on the Greek island of Hydra as he was writing his early fiction and poetry: “There would be a gardenia on my desk perfuming the whole room,” he said. “There would be a little sandwich at noon. Sweetness, sweetness everywhere.” It is a gorgeous image of succour and care by the muse to the creator, and one which the writer Polly Samson returns to again and again in her new novel, A Theatre for Dreamers, which features Marianne and Leonard but more significantly the Australian writer (and sometime Sydney Morning Herald columnist) Charmian Clift and her husband George Johnston (My Brother Jack) on Hydra in 1960. Marianne Ihlen with her baby son, Axel Jensen, with Leonard Cohen, an unidentified friend and George Johnston and Charmian Clift on Hydra in October 1960. Credit:James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images Samson is married to David Gilmour, a solo artist now for many years but formerly one of the front men of Pink Floyd. The father of her first-born child, Charlie (who was formally adopted by Gilmour; the Gilmours have three more children together — Joe, Gabriel and Romany) was the late Heathcote Williams, poet, writer, political pamphleteer and sometimes fire-eater. They met when she was the Jonathan Cape publicist for his book Whale Nation; he was a reluctant self-publicist, she was determined to make the book a bestseller, Samson won the battle. But Williams left her shortly after Charlie was born in 1989 and she was homeless for a while, relying on the kindness of friends to take her in, with her baby. Her relationship with Gilmour seems to be very much one of equals and mutual muse-ing. (Indeed, Gilmour was reported as joking that he was a humble geisha to his wife; I am able to attest that he is certainly happy to cook and make coffee as he became patron to the prison charity I co-founded, Liberty Choir, after Charlie was imprisoned for his behaviour during the riots of 2011). But it was different with Williams. “I could identify in some ways with Marianne because my relationship wasn’t that different to how I perceive hers was with Axel (Jensen, a garlanded Norwegian writer and Marianne’s shortlived husband; father of their son, also Axel, who has been in a mental institution for most of his adult life),” Samson says. Williams and Jensen even performed together in the '60s, she was intrigued to discover at a poetry reading. Replay   “Heathcote was very, very driven and whatever he was doing, it was all hands to the mill,” Samson says. ""I definitely did the cooking and trying to make things nice. Aware that work came first, the baby came second - that sort of thing. He may have driven me to doing the gardenia, eventually!” She points out that both writers succumbed to critic Cyril Connolly's famous dictum that a pram in the hall is the enemy to creativity, and this has led to her singular interpretation of what the muse represents. “With writers like Axel and Heathcote, the muse is really Mummy,” Samson says. ""What does Mummy do? Mummy puts the food on the table for you. Mummy helps you and makes the lovely place where you do your scribbles really lovely for you. And that’s what the muse is — a mummy for a man who longs for his mummy. “If the muse then becomes an actual mother, that is not great for the man who is expecting Mummy to provide only for the darling. And that’s why these relationships don’t work, I think, once there is a baby.” We are talking in a lovely place, indeed. A large corner house with windows all round, the better to take in the expansive view of the rolling waves and pebbly beach of seaside Hove (considered the respectable ageing relative to rackety young Brighton next door) on the coast of Sussex. On the wall of the open plan kitchen-dining room downstairs, there is a framed photo by the Australian photographer Polly Borland, a friend who used to live in a nearby square (Nick Cave and his family were in the same purlieu), from her human rabbit series. We go upstairs to the living room, dominated at one end by a concert grand piano, with music from Erik Satie’s Gymnopaedie which Sampson is currently practising. I’m sort of crazy about Charmian ... I like her strength, her proto-feminism and her intelligence. The novelist is one of those unusual people whose beauty is so extreme it can prevent people taking them seriously. She offers this, herself (expressed in a way that manages not to be annoying) as one of her youthful experiences which made her feel bonded to Charmian Clift, on whom, like her novel’s heroine, Erica, she admits to having an almighty crush. Her arresting looks are inherited from her late journalist father, Lance, a German Jew, and her half-Chinese mother, Esther Cheo Ying, 87, who was a major in Mao’s Red Army in a life full of drama and not a little pain. Charmian Clift shops on Hydra.Credit:James Burke/LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Explaining why she bought up so many of the late Australian writer’s out-of-print books, she says: “because I’m sort of crazy about Charmian.” Samson is clearly a little bit obsessed but then she is not alone. The mythology that swirls around Austalia’s own version of the beautiful and the damned has led to other novels, a substantial biography, a play — all in recent years. Clift’s mystique and glamour clearly endure. Samson owns a first editon of Clift’s second travel book — Peel Me A Lotus — about her life on Hydra. The cover portrait was taken by German photographer Liselotte Strelow. It is an extraordinary image, with a bruised quality to Clift’s lovely features; she stares at you half defiant, half haunted. It is not flattering, and yet she was a known beauty. Samson points out that there appears to be an actual bruise under her left eye. “It does beg a lot of questions, and if she did choose it, you have to wonder why. But I love it. That’s the picture I want to have a beautiful print of one day to put on the wall.” So why exactly is she so mad about Clift? “I wish I knew. It’s her voice ... she’s a really, really beautiful writer who just puts you right there. You can see her world through her eyes. I sort of felt inhabited by her but also inhabiting her. You can see her world through her eyes, I sort of felt inhabited by her but also inhabiting her. “And it’s also something to do with her being done down by people because of the way she looks. When I was younger I experienced that. People wanting to write you off. ""No-one credited you with having a brain. I think she suffered that and so I have that sympathy for her. And when you read her essays, I like her strength, her proto-feminism and her intelligence. And I think I’m also obviously drawn to suicides.” George Johnston and Charmian Clift working side-by-side in Sydney in 1948, before they moved to Hydra.Credit:Fairfax This startling observation comes partly a propos of her original idea for this, her second novel. Her subject was to have been writer Assia Weevil, whom she says, with some indignation, has been reduced to a suicidal cipher to poet Ted Hughes. (Hughes' wife Sylvia Plath gassed herself after discovering his affair with Weevil; Weevil later killed herself and their daughter Shura, also by gassing). Her mission was to give Weevil back a life to show how she was a woman of substance in her own right, her work including translating Hebrew poetry and being the first woman to write and direct a narrative film advertisement. But Samson kept meeting Frieda Hughes (daughter of Hughes and Plath), until she felt that it would be impossible to write about her stepmother and father. This occurred despite more than a year of research and a brilliant opening provided by an email exchange she had with author Fay Weldon, who knew Weevil and told her, “I remember just after Sylvia died, and Assia and Ted came into a room and everyone turned round and hissed at her,’ and I thought, ‘Oh my God, that’s the first scene'.” Meanwhile, on the last day of a family holiday on Hydra, Samson spotted Peel me a Lotus on the bookshelves of the owner’s house they were renting, read it at a gallop and was instantly gripped. ""When I got back I looked up Charmian on line and lo and behold, here was another woman who had killed herself and was intimately related to a man who was more feted as a writer than she was."" Samson followed up with Nadia Wheatley’s “big and brilliant” biography of Clift (The Life and Myth of Charmian Clift), read the collected essays and then devoured everything she could about Clift and Johnston. She had a new subject but it, too, was not entirely straightforward. From left: George Johnston and Charmian Clift chat to Marianne Ihlen and Leonard Cohen on a Hydra beach, October 1960. Credit:James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images Her new worry was how to include Cohen, whom she reveres as a songwriter, with the mortifying potential for social embarrassment if she were to bump into him. By now, she and her husband had fallen in love with Hydra and bought their own house on the island. The couple spent some part of each month there and the writing is imbued with an intimate sense of connection to its landscape and history. It may sound ruthlessly unsentimental but with Cohen’s death, which happened when Gilmour and Samson were on Hydra, the problem was solved: “Obviously I felt really sad but I also thought, ‘Oh, hang on ... Gosh, there’s a thing.’” Also on this same trip, out of season, the only other diner at a taverna which opened especially for them transpired to be the man who lived in Australia House, the former home of Clift and Johnston. Samson ended up writing part of her novel about Clift in her very house, which must have felt phantasmagoric. The next setback was that Gilmour, whom she credits with being an indispensable support with research, discovered that his wife’s idea of writing the autobiographical novel that Clift never completed had already been done (or a version of it) by Australian writer Susan Johnson in her 2004 novel The Broken Book. Polly Samson and her musician husband David Gilmour.Credit:Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images Europe However by now, Hydra and Charmian, and George, Leonard and Marianne had taken hold of her, and Samson persevered, settling on a bildungsroman — using real characters as well as invented. The narrator of the novel is Erica, an elderly woman when we meet her, who has returned to Hydra, reminiscing about her time there when she was 18. The central force of the book is the relationship between Erica (a fully fictional character, inspired by the profile of a young dark-haired, ponytailed girl in one of LIFE magazine's James Burke’s 1573 photographs from Hydra, all of which Samson has seen and studied) and Clift — a daughter longing for a mother, and a mother yearning for her lost daughter. Erica’s mother, a great friend of Clift’s, has died, leaving her daughter money to travel; Clift gave away her baby daughter, Suzanne Chick, when she was 19. It is these twin losses that bind the older and young women. At first, Erica was a pragmatic vehicle through which all the characters could be observed: the rule was that only the names of those who visited the island in 1960 would be included. (So no Sidney Nolan or Peter Finch, for instance.) “It’s her story but I didn’t want her to overwhelm the book. I wanted a pair of eyes to place the reader right in the middle of that colony. I needed her to be very young so that she’s not bringing all her history but she’s bringing something — which is that she needs to meet Charmian. "" From the opening pages, you feel instantly transplanted into the life of pre-electric Hydra — the carrying of blocks of ice up the steep ascent, passing the donkeys which are still omnipresent beasts of burden; the lugging of water from the well; the drinking outside Katsikas grocery store with the Van Gogh chairs and tables on the cobbles; the young art students who are drawn like magnets from all round the world, as well as the established successful and would-be novelists. Mostly, Samson took no liberties — all Cohen’s words, for instance, are his own. One exception is that she changed the months that American beat poet Gregory Corso was on the island. The ending of the book, takes us back to the start, with Erica in her 70s, living on her own back in Hydra, her head full of memories of all those years ago. “In some ways, it is wish fulfillment, “Samson says. “Her ending is how I would like my ending to be. I’d love to be someone completely happy to be on my own. “And I think the idea of having Erica’s ending walking around Hydra, going swimming and putting a gardenia and a sandwich on her own desk and not needing anyone else to put it there for her, is actually a really wonderful progression.” I wonder whether this suggests that Samson is unhappy being on her own? “No, it’s not that I need a person — I only need David.” Do you find that a weakness in yourself? “No, I find it a strength in us as a couple but ... what I do think is that we do have this age difference and the thing that keeps me awake at night is thinking that unless I die young, which I don’t particularly want to do, the likelihood is that I am going to be like a swan without her mate. “I genuinely do feel so pair-bonded and so it doesn’t feel like a weakness but it feels like a potential for enormous pain later. Like the pleasures of today will be paid for later on.” And then she ends where we began, with a laugh: “I did once send him a text message saying , ‘So where’s my f*+@#ing gardenia?!” Polly Samson's novel A Theatre for Dreamers will be published by Bloomsbury on April 15.

By Ginny Dougary Polly Samson in Hydra. On October 10, 2016, The New Yorker printed an interview by its editor, David Remnick, with a fast-fading but still spirited Leonard Cohen. A month later, the sad news hit the world that the Canadian singer-songwriter had died. In that valedictory encounter, the two men talked about Cohen’s last letter to his old love Marianne Ihlen, on her own death bed three short months earlier, and how the tender words to her had been shared many times around the world since. Cohen was overtaken, Remnick wrote, by the memory of the couple’s time together on the Greek island of Hydra as he was writing his early fiction and poetry: “There would be a gardenia on my desk perfuming the whole room,” he said. “There would be a little sandwich at noon. Sweetness, sweetness everywhere.” It is a gorgeous image of succour and care by the muse to the creator, and one which the writer Polly Samson returns to again and again in her new novel, A Theatre for Dreamers, which features Marianne and Leonard but more significantly the Australian writer (and sometime Sydney Morning Herald columnist) Charmian Clift and her husband George Johnston (My Brother Jack) on Hydra in 1960. Marianne Ihlen with her baby son, Axel Jensen, with Leonard Cohen, an unidentified friend and George Johnston and Charmian Clift on Hydra in October 1960. Credit:James Burke/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images Samson is married to David Gilmour, a solo artist now for many years but formerly one of the front men of Pink Floyd. The father of her first-born child, Charlie (who was formally adopted by Gilmour; the Gilmours have three more children together — Joe, Gabriel and Romany) was the late Heathcote Williams, poet, writer, political pamphleteer and sometimes fire-eater. They met when she was the Jonathan Cape publicist for his book Whale Nation; he was a reluctant self-publicist, she was determined to make the book a bestseller, Samson won the battle. But Williams left her shortly after Charlie was born in 1989 and she was homeless for a while, relying on the kindness of friends to take her in, with her baby. Her relationship with Gilmour seems to be very much one of equals and mutual muse-ing. (Indeed, Gilmour was reported as joking that he was a humble geisha to his wife; I am able to attest that he is certainly happy to cook and make coffee as he became patron to the prison charity I co-founded, Liberty Choir, after Charlie was imprisoned for his behaviour during the riots of 2011). But it was different with Williams. “I could identify in some ways with Marianne because my relationship wasn’t that different to how I perceive hers was with Axel (Jensen, a garlanded Norwegian writer and Marianne’s shortlived husband; father of their son, also Axel, who has been in a mental institution for most of his adult life),” Samson says. Williams and Jensen even performed together in the '60s, she was intrigued to discover at a poetry reading. Replay   “Heathcote was very, very driven and whatever he was doing, it was all hands to the mill,” Samson says. ""I definitely did the cooking and trying to make things nice. Aware that work came first, the baby came second - that sort of thing. He may have driven me to doing the gardenia, eventually!” She points out that both writers succumbed to critic Cyril Connolly's famous dictum that a pram in the hall is the enemy to creativity, and this has led to her singular interpretation of what the muse represents. “With writers like Axel and Heathcote, the muse is really Mummy,” Samson says. ""What does Mummy do? Mummy puts the food on the table for you. Mummy helps you and makes the lovely place where you do your scribbles really lovely for you. And that’s what the muse is — a mummy for a man who longs for his mummy. “If the muse then becomes an actual mother, that is not great for the man who is expecting Mummy to provide only for the darling. And that’s why these relationships don’t work, I think, once there is a baby.” We are talking in a lovely place, indeed. A large corner house with windows all round, the better to take in the expansive view of the rolling waves and pebbly beach of seaside Hove (considered the respectable ageing relative to rackety young Brighton next door) on the coast of Sussex. On the wall of the open plan kitchen-dining room downstairs, there is a framed photo by the Australian photographer Polly Borland, a friend who used to live in a nearby square (Nick Cave and his family were in the same purlieu), from her human rabbit series. We go upstairs to the living room, dominated at one end by a concert grand piano, with music from Erik Satie’s Gymnopaedie which Sampson is currently practising. I’m sort of crazy about Charmian ... I like her strength, her proto-feminism and her intelligence. The novelist is one of those unusual people whose beauty is so extreme it can prevent people taking them seriously. She offers this, herself (expressed in a way that manages not to be annoying) as one of her youthful experiences which made her feel bonded to Charmian Clift, on whom, like her novel’s heroine, Erica, she admits to having an almighty crush. Her arresting looks are inherited from her late journalist father, Lance, a German Jew, and her half-Chinese mother, Esther Cheo Ying, 87, who was a major in Mao’s Red Army in a life full of drama and not a little pain. Charmian Clift shops on Hydra.Credit:James Burke/LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Explaining why she bought up so many of the late Australian writer’s out-of-print books, she says: “because I’m sort of crazy about Charmian.” Samson is clearly a little bit obsessed but then she is not alone. The mythology that swirls around Austalia’s own version of the beautiful and the damned has led to other novels, a substantial biography, a play — all in recent years. Clift’s mystique and glamour clearly endure. Samson owns a first editon of Clift’s second travel book — Peel Me A Lotus — about her life on Hydra. The cover portrait was taken by German photographer Liselotte Strelow. It is an extraordinary image, with a bruised quality to Clift’s lovely features; she stares at you half defiant, half haunted. It is not flattering, and yet she was a known beauty. Samson points out that there appears to be an actual bruise under her left eye. “It does beg a lot of questions, and if she did choose it, you have to wonder why. But I love it. That’s the picture I want to have a beautiful print of one day to put on the wall.” So why exactly is she so mad about Clift? “I wish I knew. It’s her voice ... she’s a really, really beautiful writer who just puts you right there. You can see her world through her eyes. I sort of felt inhabited by her but also inhabiting her. You can see her world through her eyes, I sort of felt inhabited by her but also inhabiting her. “And it’s also something to do with her being done down by people because of the way she looks. When I was younger I experienced that. People wanting to write you off. ""No-one credited you with having a brain. I think she suffered that and so I have that sympathy for her.

The business was founded by the Wheelers who travelled from the UK through Europe and Asia before arriving in Australia in 1972 where they published Across Asia on The Cheap the following year. BBC Worldwide purchased a 75 per cent stake in Lonely Planet in 2007 before acquiring the remaining share in 2011. The business is now owned by US billionaire Brad Kelley's company NC2 Media. In 2014 the Wheelers received Queen's birthday honours for ""distinguished service to business and commerce as a publisher of travel guides, and as a benefactor to a range of Australian arts and aid organisations"". Staff at the travel publisher were told the news on Wednesday. Those laid off will be paid out their entitlements after the consultation process has ended. One former employee was unsurprised about the company's demise, saying ""it's been a shitshow for a long time now"". Do you know more?

71,/culture/books/lonely-planet-shuts-australian-office-staff-laid-off-due-to-covid-19-20200409-p54ijv.html,"Lonely Planet shuts Australian office, staff laid off due to COVID-19","Global publishing giant Lonely Planet is closing its Australian and London offices ""almost entirely"" as the coronavirus pandemic continues to cripple the travel industry. The travel media company publishes country guidebooks for travellers and employs hundreds of staff worldwide. Tony Wheeler, co-founder of Lonely Planet, said he was ""shocked"" to hear the company was winding down its Australian office. Credit:Max Seigal  ""Due to the impact of COVID-19 on demand and sales Lonely Planet has made the difficult decision to reduce its publishing operations for the foreseeable future,"" a spokesman said. Lonely Planet will continue publishing its popular country guidebooks and phrasebooks, but will not commission any new ancillary titles such as coffee table books, children's books or the Lonely Planet magazine. Founded in Australia in 1973, Lonely Planet grew to become the go-to publisher of travel guides worldwide, with the company's books filling the backpacks of millions of tourists. Tony Wheeler, who founded Lonely Planet with his wife Maureen but is no longer connected to the company, said he was ""shocked"" when he found out the news. ""Am I sad? Of course, I’m sad about a lot of things. Who knows what's going to happen to the travel industry,"" he told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. ""They are still on the shelves 50 years later which I guess is some source of achievement. Will they be in a year’s time? I don’t know. ""If there's not a market for getting on airplanes then there's not a market for guide books."" Replay   Mr Wheeler, a part-owner of Text Publishing, said he was particularly surprised Lonely Planet was shrinking its operations because the industry had actually seen strong demand during the recent lockdown. ""It seems to be a little bit jumping the gun,"" he said. ""Book sales are a bit like toilet paper – people are hoarding them, buying them while they’re locked down.""
