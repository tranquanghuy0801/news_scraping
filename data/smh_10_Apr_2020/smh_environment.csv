Researchers grew two groups of starfish to the age of 10 months and 6½ years respectively, preventing them from eating coral. They found both groups grew to the same maximum size of 16 to 18 millimetres, and that the second group had no trouble switching to a coral diet at the age of 6.5 years. Once on a coral diet, the starfish could rapidly grow to up to a metre in length and consume a square metre of reef in a day or two, said Professor Maria Byrne, who supervised the research. She said it was long understood that other predatory starfish around the world switched from a herbivorous diet as they matured, but that the research had never been done on the crown-of-thorns. The starfish can do extreme damage to the reef when their numbers increase from time to time. It is thought that nutrient rich agricultural run-off might have spurred increased numbers of crown-of-thorns at their larval stage, while overfishing might have reduced the number of predator fish that might have curbed their numbers as juveniles, causing population breakouts. The Great Barrier Reef is suffering from the fifth and most extensive mass bleaching event since 1998, with severe bleaching hitting its northern, central and southern sectors. Due to climate change, the reef is now suffering such events without El Nino weather events triggering them, professors Terry Hughes and Morgan Pratchett wrote in The Conversation website this week. “The Great Barrier Reef will continue to lose corals from heat stress, until global emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced to net zero, and sea temperatures stabilise,” they wrote. “Without urgent action to achieve this outcome, it’s clear our coral reefs will not survive business-as-usual emissions.” Copyright © 2020", Nick O'Malley ,"April 8, 2020"

Last year the Yallourn power station in Victoria increased its emissions of the same pollutant by 82 per cent and the amount from the Gladstone power station in Queensland increased by 23 per cent. Environmental Justice Australia reported the increase in fine particle emissions after analysing data gathered and published by energy companies for the National Pollutant Inventory. Vales Point is operated by Delta Electricity, whose company secretary Steve Gurney told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that the fine particulate pollution, known as PM2.5, appeared to have increased “a little bit” last year because the station’s filters needed replacing at the time testing was conducted. He did not address the 3000 per cent increase since 2013. Over the same period Vales Point increased the amount of power it generated by 63 per cent. Fine particle emissions from the Vales Point Power Station have increased by 3000 per cent over the past six years.Credit:Peter Rae A spokesman for EnergyAustralia, which operates the Yallourn power station, said that in 2018 power production from Yallourn was down by about 6 per cent and most emissions that power generators are required to report on were also down. But he did not explain the 82 per cent increase in PM2.5 emissions in the year to 2019. According to a State of Global Air study released in 2018, exposure to PM2.5 emissions contributed to 4.1 million deaths around the world from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and respiratory infections in 2016. Nicola Rivers, from Environmental Justice Australia, said the jump in emissions was extraordinary. Nicola Rivers, the head of research with Environmental Justice Australia,  said that it appeared that the only reasons for the extraordinary jump in PM2.5 pollution from Vales Point could be that the reported figures were wrong, or its pollution abatement systems had not been turned on or that they had failed. She said the jump in emissions from the Yallourn power station appeared to confirm Environmental Justice Australia’s concerns that the station’s electrostatic precipitators - equipment used to capture particulate pollution - were not functioning properly. Asked if this was the case, EnergyAustralia did not address the question directly, but said in a statement, “The performance of Yallourn power station’s precipitators is monitored, and the equipment subject to routine maintenance as well as third-party independent checks from time to time to identify areas needing attention.” Environmental Justice Australia has been seeking information about Yallourn’s electrostatic precipitators via a freedom of information request, which is currently the subject of a legal dispute. Environmental Justice Australia is a public interest legal organisation. Its lawyers act on behalf of people and community organisations to safeguard health and the environment. The National Pollution Inventory was established by the state and federal governments to monitor pollutants and promote better air quality standards. ""It’s clear it has fallen short of that objective and that strong policy, laws and regulations are required to force coal-fired power stations to clean up their act,” said Ms Rivers. Vales Point and Yallourn are two of the oldest coal fired power stations in Australia. Due to its age, Vales Point was sold by the NSW government to the energy entrepreneur Trevor St Baker for $1 million in 2015, only to be revalued at $730 million in 2017 after demand increased.

10,/environment/climate-change/coronavirus-presents-us-with-terrible-climate-risk-and-opportunity-20200403-p54guo.html,Coronavirus presents us with terrible climate risk - and opportunity,"You could hardly conceive of a more potent metaphor for the blow coronavirus has dealt to the world’s fight to reduce carbon emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate change. As governments around the world switched focus from what was to have been the most important international climate conference in half a decade, British authorities converted Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre, where the conference was to have been held, into a field hospital for up to a thousand pandemic victims, complete with testing facilities, laboratories and a morgue. Workmen erect fencing around Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre as it is turned into a field hospital.Credit:Getty Images The now-postponed conference known as COP26 was seen by scientists - and many world leaders - as the last best chance for governments to set in place critical carbon emissions reduction targets. The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit warming to beneath a potentially devastating 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. But even under the non-binding targets that nations set for themselves in Paris, it was clear by last year that those aims would not be met unless even more ambitious targets were set in Glasgow. This ratcheting effect was how the Paris framework was designed. So today, even as the skies, roads and seas of the world empty of polluting engines, as factories shut down and power plants reduce their output and emissions due to the lockdown of around three billion people, scientists fret that governments will be sapped of the energy, will and treasure they will need to tackle climate change once the economy is kickstarted. The debate over how governments rebuild economies after the peak of the pandemic has become the new front line of the climate war. The decisions that governments make over the next few weeks over their economies will also decide whether or not the world avoids the worst climate impacts, says Anna Skarbek, director of ClimateWorks, a policy research centre associated with Monash University. As with other experts contacted by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, Skarbek understands the decision to defer the Glasgow talks, saying that holding them next year gives governments the opportunity to develop stimulus measures in line with Paris goals. “For the climate this is the time of greatest risk but also of greatest opportunity,” she says. Should governments spend wisely they can decarbonise their economies even more quickly than they had expected to. “The flipside is that if they don’t, it is a double negative,” she said. Rather than creating green economies as they seek to spend their way out of the crisis, they will lock in dirty industries, equipment and infrastructure and be left unable to act due to eye-watering deficits in the last critical decade we have to avert the predicted catastrophe. Replay   She notes that the infrastructure, plant and equipment Australian consumers, business and governments choose to spend on now will have a direct impact on outcomes in 2030 and 2050. Climate change, she says, is no longer a future problem. This weekend ClimateWorks brought forward the release of a major research project it has conducted into how Australia could use available technology to meet critical emissions targets. Though couched in determinedly positive terms, the careful language of the report, Decarbonisation Futures, is telling. It outlines how Australians might still have a two in three chance to meet targets consistent with averting the worst predicted climate outcomes. “Decarbonisation Futures scenarios show that Australia can still reduce emissions in line with limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees – and if governments, businesses and individuals go ‘all-in’, a 1.5-degree limit could be within reach,” it says. According to the report, over the past five years technological hurdles have already been overcome that allow for drastic decreases in emissions associated with Australia’s power generation, building stock, transport, industry and agriculture sectors. Though some commentators have called for the government to abandon its climate action as a result of the pandemic, an unusual consensus is emerging that Australia should maintain its commitments and calling on the government to invest in climate action to drive economic recovery. Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Mark Butler said the Australian Labor Party continues to back the emissions reduction commitment under the Paris climate agreement, which requires a cut of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. Butler urged the government to go further and set a net zero emissions target, arguing the government should stimulate economic recovery with investment in green energy and emissions reduction technology. “Australia will need investment in job creation industries, like renewables, storage and hydrogen, to renew our ageing and increasingly unreliable power grid but also to keep power prices down for struggling households and businesses,” Butler said.

Sceptics note that though the government voices its support for technologically-driven climate solutions, it still has not revealed its plans. In February Taylor said Australia would release a long-term emissions reduction strategy ahead of the Glasgow climate talks, which were set for November. He also said the government would release at an unspecified date a Technology Investment Roadmap as part of its strategy. With COP26 delayed until further notice, it is unclear when this work will be completed and made public. Either way, the Morrison government stops short of a net zero emissions target, which climate scientists say is required to limit global warming to under two degrees Celsius by 2050, and will likely use “carry-over credits” gained by exceeding the previous Kyoto climate agreement to meet about half the emissions reduction required under Paris. During a December UN climate conference Australia was widely criticised for its insistence on counting carry-over credits. Laurence Tubiana, the former French environment minister and one of the key architects of the Paris agreement, described Australia’s position as “cheating”, saying “Australia was willing … to destroy the whole [Paris] system”. Few experts expect the current fall in emissions due to the pandemic to afford the world much breathing space to deal with climate change, no matter how significant they become. “I expect coronavirus to have more of an impact but we simply don’t know what will happen in the future,” ANU Climate Change Institute director Mark Howden said. “Cancelling the Glasgow talks means the conversations that could’ve helped change the emissions trajectory may come too late now, which means we need a national conversation on climate change.” Howden said global emissions fell about three per cent during the Global Financial Crisis and took just two years to rebound to the previous level. The Australian Industry Group and even the Minerals Council of Australia called for the government to invest in emissions reduction technology in the wake of coronavirus. This sentiment is echoed around the world, at least rhetorically. The EU’s climate chief Frans Timmermans said in a statement: “As for the European Commission, we will not slow down our work domestically or internationally to prepare for an ambitious COP26, when it takes place.” Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told InsideClimate News that the postponement might even make it easier for participants to deal with the potential re-election of the climate sceptic US President Donald Trump, who has already announced he plans to abandon the Paris agreement in the days following the US election in November. ""With this scenario at least you have clarity on who the president is well before the meeting,"" Meyer said. ""And in a Trump scenario, they would have more than six days to think through the implications of four more years of Trump and figure out their response."" Despite overwhelming global support for the efforts there is already evidence that the pandemic is damaging climate action. Just days before the meeting was suspended Japan, the nation with the world’s fifth-largest economy and third-largest carbon footprint, announced its renewed Paris targets, essentially locking in the same goals it committed to five years ago. Kat Kramer, a climate expert at the charity Christian Aid, called Japan's plan “an international disgrace”. “The fact they are smuggling it out during a global pandemic when it will avoid the scrutiny it deserves is shameful,” she added. The Trump administration cited coronavirus last month as it announced a sweeping relaxation of regulations against pollution from power stations and industry and the abandonment of Obama-era automobile fuel efficiency standards, a move that will result in the emission of a billion more tonnes of greenhouse gases over the next five years. China is also considering abandoning car emissions standards, according to a Bloomberg report. In the first three weeks of March the Chinese government approved more new coal-fired power plants than it did during all of 2019. And even if world leaders do use the postponement of the Glasgow talks to incorporate carbon emissions reductions into their post-pandemic stimulus plans, experts warn that any delay means that subsequent reductions will have to be even steeper and more shocking to economies. ""The science tells us emissions must peak this year if we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,” Christiana Figueres, who served as UN climate chief between 2011 and 2016, said in a statement this week. “And the Paris agreement set the COP26 summit as the moment when all countries would ramp up their targets in line with the steep emissions decline we need to see in this decisive next decade.” Nick O'Malley is National Environment and Climate Editor for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

11,/environment/climate-change/coronavirus-presents-us-with-terrible-climate-risk-and-opportunity-20200403-p54guo.html,Coronavirus presents us with terrible climate risk - and opportunity,"You could hardly conceive of a more potent metaphor for the blow coronavirus has dealt to the world’s fight to reduce carbon emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate change. As governments around the world switched focus from what was to have been the most important international climate conference in half a decade, British authorities converted Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre, where the conference was to have been held, into a field hospital for up to a thousand pandemic victims, complete with testing facilities, laboratories and a morgue. Workmen erect fencing around Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre as it is turned into a field hospital.Credit:Getty Images The now-postponed conference known as COP26 was seen by scientists - and many world leaders - as the last best chance for governments to set in place critical carbon emissions reduction targets. The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit warming to beneath a potentially devastating 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees. But even under the non-binding targets that nations set for themselves in Paris, it was clear by last year that those aims would not be met unless even more ambitious targets were set in Glasgow. This ratcheting effect was how the Paris framework was designed. So today, even as the skies, roads and seas of the world empty of polluting engines, as factories shut down and power plants reduce their output and emissions due to the lockdown of around three billion people, scientists fret that governments will be sapped of the energy, will and treasure they will need to tackle climate change once the economy is kickstarted. The debate over how governments rebuild economies after the peak of the pandemic has become the new front line of the climate war. The decisions that governments make over the next few weeks over their economies will also decide whether or not the world avoids the worst climate impacts, says Anna Skarbek, director of ClimateWorks, a policy research centre associated with Monash University. As with other experts contacted by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, Skarbek understands the decision to defer the Glasgow talks, saying that holding them next year gives governments the opportunity to develop stimulus measures in line with Paris goals. “For the climate this is the time of greatest risk but also of greatest opportunity,” she says. Should governments spend wisely they can decarbonise their economies even more quickly than they had expected to. “The flipside is that if they don’t, it is a double negative,” she said. Rather than creating green economies as they seek to spend their way out of the crisis, they will lock in dirty industries, equipment and infrastructure and be left unable to act due to eye-watering deficits in the last critical decade we have to avert the predicted catastrophe. Replay   She notes that the infrastructure, plant and equipment Australian consumers, business and governments choose to spend on now will have a direct impact on outcomes in 2030 and 2050. Climate change, she says, is no longer a future problem. This weekend ClimateWorks brought forward the release of a major research project it has conducted into how Australia could use available technology to meet critical emissions targets. Though couched in determinedly positive terms, the careful language of the report, Decarbonisation Futures, is telling. It outlines how Australians might still have a two in three chance to meet targets consistent with averting the worst predicted climate outcomes. “Decarbonisation Futures scenarios show that Australia can still reduce emissions in line with limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees – and if governments, businesses and individuals go ‘all-in’, a 1.5-degree limit could be within reach,” it says.

But this past summer, global warming and geopolitical manoeuvring have turned up the heat to dangerous levels. By Luke Slattery “Last-chance tourism” is how travel operators describe the urge of some to get to Antarctica “before it melts”.Credit:Getty Images A pair of humpback whales has been inspecting the expedition cruise ship Roald Amundsen, lying a notch below 65 degrees south in the mirrored waters of the Lemaire Channel. But they’ve had a change of mind. It’s our tiny Zodiac boat, little more than a high-tech tyre, that now intrigues them. The driver cuts the engine as the humpbacks draw closer. Every few minutes they surface to spout. The temperature today in the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1300-kilometre-long tendril of ice, snow and bedrock reaching towards the tip of South America, is close to freezing. Each blast from a humpback blowhole is followed by a plume of steam. Suddenly a barnacle-encrusted tail slices through the still black water, just out of reach. For the fearful, it’s too close for comfort; for the intrepid, it’s too good to be true. The leviathans slide beneath us, descending as steadily as elevators, and disappear. I study the depths, looking one way, then another. Nothing. Then, a scant few metres below, the larger of the two reappears, turning its immense white belly upwards like an outsized puppy begging for a scratch. It’s a remarkable moment in a defining – or redefining – Antarctic summer. A summer of discontent. For much of human history, the white continent has stood gloriously apart: an enchanted castle at the earth’s end, buttressed by ramparts of ice, with the gelid Southern Ocean for a protective moat. The highest, coldest, windiest, driest, loneliest continent has endured whaling and sealing and over-fishing since it was discovered 200 years ago. But Antarctica today confronts a cluster of threats – all man-made – that it is ill-equipped to withstand. Early this year, Antarctic summer temperatures spiked to improbable new heights, vaulting above 20 degrees: T-shirt weather. Glaciers on the west of the continent shrank at record rates and penguin species battled to survive. At the same time, nation states jostled for influence in a resource-rich and strategically sensitive region, while the number of travellers during the November-March tourism window soared. In all, nearly 78,000 tourists were scheduled to have sailed to Antarctica this season, more than double the number only a decade ago. A signpost at one of Antarctica’s 76 research stations: there are 40 year-round and 36 in summer. They are ostensibly there for research but also to tacitly shore up territorial claims or ambitions.Credit:Getty Images The season came to a dramatic close last month. When and how it resumes will depend in large measure on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of the post-viral cruise industry. But then, most Antarctic experts view tourism as a lesser threat to the polar environment than climate change and the possibility that the continent could be reduced to a fishery and a mine by the middle of this century. In late January, as I travelled to the Antarctic Peninsula for the second time in a year, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the volume of ice lost annually from the 14-million-square-kilometre continent, which locks up 90 per cent of the world’s fresh water in its frozen form, had increased at least sixfold since 1979. Almost a quarter of the rapidly thinning West Antarctic ice sheet is believed to be unstable, and satellites in late March revealed that the East Antarctic ice sheet – the larger of the two – is increasingly vulnerable. In the same few weeks at sea, news reached the Roald Amundsen that the world’s biggest iceberg, named A68 by the US National Ice Centre as if it were a robot from a Star Wars prequel, had done a runner. If and when it tips – a moment unlikely to be discernible until it’s already past – Antarctica will become an aggressive driver of climate change. In 2017, this Bali-sized berg calved from the Larsen C Ice Shelf, on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and for more than two years remained hemmed in by sea ice. But this southern summer it cut loose, gathered speed and began to drift north into open water. An alpha berg with a surface area of 5800 square kilometres in its prime, A68 will soon begin to splinter into bergy bits, growlers, shards and ice blocks before melting into an ocean already rising by an estimated three millimetres a year. A few months before this journey I visit the Australian Antarctic Division, a sprawling space station-like complex on Hobart’s southern fringe, for a briefing from its director, Kim Ellis. Though the effects of climate change are less visible across the Australian Antarctic Territory on the east of the continent, which Ellis administers, than on the western Antarctic Peninsula, where I’m headed, he has no doubt that warming on the continent is a concrete and not a spectral thing. The Antarctic is estimated to have lost three trillion tonnes of ice over the past 25 years and Ellis holds grave fears of an approaching tipping point. “As ocean salinity changes due to the melting ice sheet and freshwater run-off, so do ocean currents,” says the 64-year-old former army officer in a bright bureaucratic tone that conceals the gravity of this grim scenario. “The currents around the Antarctic are a major cooling factor. The Antarctic is the Earth’s airconditioner.” If and when it tips – a moment unlikely to be discernible until it’s already past – Antarctica will become an aggressive driver of climate change. A warming, melting Antarctic would likely propel global sea levels one to two metres higher by 2100, washing an erstwhile frozen continent to the doorstep of many coastal communities. Experts believe it would also stimulate a change in the direction and strength of the world’s big currents, and deplete oceanic oxygen levels and nutrition to the point where the Earth’s surface water would resemble a “marine desert”. In the same facility I meet the Australian Antarctic Division’s acting chief scientist, Dirk Welsford, who is dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt bearing a cartoon of a rather wan-looking penguin. He’s a marine ecologist and like his boss, bearded. Ellis sports a trimmed, almost Elizabethan beard; Welsford’s whiskers are more bearish. He stresses the dramatic temperature fluctuations on the continent between years, seasons and regions, preferring the term “climate strange” to “climate change”. “The key thing we’re seeing is that everything is less predictable than it used to be,” he explains. “The ice might break out earlier than normal, or later than normal. That’s the big message for us from climate change – it’s not a steady upward swing. It’s pulsing in unpredictable ways.” The new normal, for Welsford, is the abnormal. It is January 28 when I board the Roald Amundsen, a new hybrid-powered Norwegian tourist ship named after the country’s polar explorer who beat Briton Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole (Scott never returned). With 400-odd passengers aboard, it sets out from the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, cruises down fjords and enters the Drake Passage separating the southern tip of the Americas from the scenic South Shetland Islands 120 kilometres north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The ship steams with a rocking-horse motion over a five-metre swell. Outside, on deck, a high wind gives a throaty roar. Chunky skuas swoop and dive. The sky is lidded with a film of eerie grey, featureless cloud that seems fitting for a journey to a world apart. On our first dawn beyond the Drake Passage, we spy the South Shetlands. Our arrival is heralded by rafts of chubby penguins porpoising – dive and glide, dive and glide – to open sea. These endearing dart-shaped aquatic birds, the Antarctic’s best-loved mascots, thread their way across the water on resolute paths. They have been known to travel as far as 80 kilometres from their colonies to forage, and dive to great depths. The islands, a pile of majestic snow-caked volcanic peaks, very beautiful under a blue sky but often obscured by cloud, are the polar gateway for cruise ships and many of the 32 nations that maintain Antarctic research stations. The South Shetlands enjoy shorter winters and are relatively easily provisioned, making them the low-hanging fruit of Antarctic exploration and colonisation. On King George Island, the largest of the group, 10 countries maintain permanent research stations. The Russians have even built a church on King George, and in summer the island hosts an Antarctic marathon. The head of the Amundsen’s expedition team, marine biologist Tomasz Zadrozny, has wintered over on the Polish Arctowski station at King George, and he puts its summer population at about 600. We drop anchor metaphorically – the Hurtigruten ship prefers to use a GPS and its own engines to fix its place – and come ashore on King George at Half Moon Bay. The harbour supports a healthy rookery with plenty of downy grey gentoo and chinstrap penguin chicks, their undeveloped wings hanging limply by their sides like overlong sleeves. I watch a mother waddle up to her grey, downy chick, who is asleep standing upright. She approaches, steps back seeming to consider her next move, and gives her chick a jab in the chest with her bill as if to say: “No sleeping in, kid!” The chick wakes with a start, staggers, and shoots its parent a what the… glare. The “little people” of the Antarctic were described as an “object of endless pleasure and amusement” by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, whose memoir of Scott’s ill-fated expedition, The Worst Journey in the World, is a classic of Antarctic literature from the tragi-heroic age of exploration. I doubt if that description has been bettered. When I visited the South Shetlands 12 months earlier, at exactly the same time, the cloud was mean and low, a squall thrashed humans and wildlife alike, and the landscape was only partly visible. The weather today is clear. I take in pavlova peaks, coves and great sweeps of ice-strewn ocean. But while there is snow on the heights, there’s noticeably less on the flats. Danco Island last year, where the author struggled through knee-deep snow.Credit:Luke Slattery A few days later, we come ashore at another spot I visited a year ago, almost to the day. Danco Island rises from a marbled waterway encircled by glaciers. Among the lofty basalt crags the snow settles into pillowy drifts, white on white, splashed by the sun. Down by the shore, at their Colgate-coloured fringes, the glaciers groan and crack, calving off great tower blocks of ice. We disembark our Zodiacs in groups and trek up a hillock on well-defined paths to a penguin rookery. But something seems wrong. Last year, on the same rise, I struggled through knee-deep snow. This year there is barely any snow cover at the same height, and rivulets of snowmelt rush over bare rock to the shore. It is warm – unnervingly warm. Later, when I mention this to one of the ship’s scientists she adds a detail, in her French-inflected English: “Some of our group notice also that the chicks are very small, and there are not many.” A fellow traveller jokes he has taken the cruise to see Antarctica “before it melts”. As we sail around the peninsula I note variations on this theme: the white world is retreating rapidly in the summer months, replaced by a dappled patterning of white snow and black volcanic rock. A fellow traveller at a water bubbler jokes that he has taken the cruise to see Antarctica “before it melts”; a syndrome known in the travel industry as “last-chance tourism”. But it is no joking matter. On many important measures – ice-shelf cover, water temperature, glacial stability, political certainty, and the quality of mystery, at once alluring and sinister, that defined it in the human imagination when it was still barely known – the Antarctic Peninsula is shape-shifting. One of the fastest warming regions on the planet, the peninsula’s average temperature is estimated to have shot up by three degrees in the past 50 years. A few days after our landing at Danco Island, a dramatic event in our neighbourhood hammers home the threats facing the fifth largest continent, and the threat it in turn poses to the planet if it continues to warm at current rates. On February 6, a record Antarctic high of 18.3 degrees is logged at an Argentinian station about 170 kilometres away. Sailing on the opposite side of the Antarctic Peninsula, at the same latitude, the breeze is crisp but it’s warm enough for me to head out on deck without coat or hat in the early evening. From the upper deck, I photograph the new state-of-the-art Chinese-built Brazilian research station at King George Island’s Admiralty Bay. This facility, which replaces a base destroyed by fire in 2012 – two Brazilian soldiers were found dead in the ruins – stands as a tangible sign of China’s desire to extend its influence in Antarctica. Danco Island 12 months after the author's last visit. The scene shows there is barely any snow cover at the same height, and rivulets of snowmelt rush over bare rock to the shore.Credit:Luke Slattery We enter the Lemaire Channel – 11 kilometres long and a mere 1600 metres wide at its narrowest point – to find it choked with ice. Sailing at a suitably glacial pace, we encounter a Greenpeace vessel directly in our path. The Esperanza is on the Antarctic leg of a journey from the North Pole. Her purpose is to expose the polar impact of climate change, plastic pollution and industrial fishing on penguin colonies, whales and other marine life, and she has a team of independent researchers aboard. A week later Greenpeace releases its study of Antarctic chinstrap penguins, named for distinctive facial markings that give them a helmeted appearance. The results are dramatic. The number of chinstraps on Elephant Island in the South Shetlands has fallen almost 60 per cent since the last survey in 1971. Half a century ago, there were about 123,000 breeding pairs of plucky chinstraps on the island; this summer there were a mere 52,786. From the Amundsen I call one of the researchers on the Esperanza, Alexander Borowicz, an arctic ecologist from Stony Brook University in upstate New York. The most likely cause of the “significant decline” of chinstraps, he says, is a change in ocean conditions. “We’re seeing less sea ice in winter months on the Antarctic Peninsula and in summer, it melts off early.” According to the Australian Antarctic Division’s Dirk Welsford, it’s not clear why the sea ice decline is so bad for chinstraps. “It’s one of the big questions we don’t yet have an answer to.” Some scientists believe that, much like elderly gentlemen, this breed of penguin simply resist change: their numbers seem to decline wherever and whenever they encounter a novel climate. The krill fisheries, though regulated, worry some. But to most scientists, the ice retreat and glacial melt is a bigger threat to krill. Others identify a depletion of krill stocks, on which the penguins feed. Krill depend on masses of single-cell phytoplankton, and these microscopic creatures are nourished by algae beneath sea ice. If the sea ice retreats, and the ocean’s chemistry and temperature changes dramatically, the krill population will likely shrink. Krill is also fished in Antarctica by countries including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and Norway, for use in feed for farmed salmon as well as in fish oil tablets and bait. The krill fisheries, though regulated since 1981, worry some. But to most scientists, the ice retreat and glacial melt is a bigger threat to krill. Chinstraps are not the only species dependent on these tiny translucent crustaceans, which grow to about six centimetres in length and mass in vast orange-hued blooms, surfacing at dusk. Gentoo penguins, which are thriving on Elephant Island and elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula, enjoy a more varied diet, including fish. But adelie penguins, which appear to be moving to colder regions of the continent, are also dependent on krill. So, too, are whales, fish, seals and seabirds. In fact, much of the exuberant life of Antarctica exists because of krill, the underlying reason visitors to the frozen continent are awestruck by the sight of whales launching themselves into the air, cheered by the Chaplin-esque waddle of the penguin, delighted by the giant petrel’s airborne arabesques. If krill disappear from Antarctica, as Kim Ellis succinctly explains, “the whole thing falls over”. The chinstrap penguin census at Elephant Island casts a light on a confounding human dimension of the Antarctic’s agony: the relationship between truth, half-truth and lies; between belief, doubt and denial. Fritz Jantschke, the Amundsen’s resident zoologist – and a former curator of the Frankfurt Zoo – cautions against continent-wide conclusions drawn from such small “dramatic” studies. Chinstraps, he adds, remain the most populous penguin species in Antarctica, with more than four million breeding pairs. An Australian scientist, who declines to be named, dismisses as “ill-considered and unhelpful” an assertion made by ornithologist Noah Strycker, who is associated with the Greenpeace study, that “something” in the Southern Ocean is fundamentally “broken”. The importance of scientific sobriety is underscored by Bert van Bavel, research director at the Norwegian Water Institute, who is on board the Amundsen to study water temperature and marine litter. A few days before our journey, Sky News reported that hundreds of mostly microscopic pieces of plastic had been found per litre of sampled Antarctic seawater. Citing a study by the British Antarctic Survey, the story was headlined: “Big worry” as scientists find plastics “pouring” into Antarctica. “There have been two theories,” van Bavel explains from the Amundsen’s science centre – a lab and library open to the ship’s guests – after a fortnight collecting specimens in the Antarctic. The first is that the circumpolar current, which rotates clockwise and acts like an aquatic fridge door to maintain a cooler water temperature in the Southern Ocean, also protects Antarctica from introduced plastics and pollutants. “The other,” says van Bavel, an environmental chemist, “is that plastics are here – and that’s why I’m here.” After a pause for dramatic effect, he goes on with a reassuring smile. “Our samples so far have found very few plastic fibres. We’ve found perhaps two or three particles per 10,000 litres of water. Some samples have been completely negative. This, of course, is good news for the Antarctic.” Van Bavel suspects that the findings of the British survey come from contaminated samples. “There are fibres everywhere,” he says plucking at his plaid shirt, “in my clothing; in your clothing.” Paradise Bay, on Antarctica’s west coast. Australia’s territory, in the east, covers 42 per cent of the continent. Credit:Getty Images Two centuries have passed since the Antarctic Peninsula was first sighted by Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen. That Russian triumph, like most things in Antarctica, is hotly disputed. The year 1820 was a big one for Antarctic exploration and three days later, on January 30, the Anglo-Irish sailor Edward Bransfield spied the peninsula’s northernmost islands. “The British and the Russians still argue about it [who got there first],” remarks German biologist Manfred Reinke, one of the specialists on board the Amundsen. “It’s as if it happened yesterday.” Tall, with a broad face and a slightly bowl-cut fringe lending him a boyish air, Reinke is the former executive secretary of the body that manages the Antarctic Treaty System. Established in 1959 and open to any member of the United Nations, the treaty had, as of last year, been signed by 54 nations. A group of 29 – original signatories and nations strong in Antarctic research – have voting rights. Among the 12 original signatories are seven nations with territorial claims, including Australia, which has the largest claim. The treaty declares that Antarctica will be used solely for “peaceful purposes” and effectively freezes the territorial ambitions of those seven countries: Argentina, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and Australia. At the same time, it freezes counter-claims and challenges by the other signatories. Because voting parties need a scientific presence there, the treaty has become a stimulus to scientific – and pseudo-scientific – activity. Any nation wishing to have skin in the Antarctic game needs a research presence on the ice. As a consequence, the continent is littered with 76 stations– 40 year-round and 36 summer – ostensibly for research but tacitly to shore up territorial claims or ambitions. Instead of an arms escalation, Antarctica faces a boffin build-up. It is no longer, in the words of British Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, one of the “void spaces of the world” to which adventurers are drawn by the “mysterious fascination of the unknown”. Rather, it has become an extreme-weather multinational colony with a seasonal rotation of staff. Manfred Reinke believes research stations used by states mainly to assert their presence in Antarctica, together with new stations built by nations wanting to become voting members, and increased tourism, are combining to place a “burden” on a continent already badly affected by climate change. “International cooperation should focus on operating a few international stations, thus relieving the continent of waste, refuse and pollution,” he says. A drastic reduction in the number of stations, and a boost in scientific collaboration along the line of international space stations, would certainly help to reduce the human footprint in Antarctica. Australia lays claim to a near six-million-square-kilometre slice of the Antarctic cheese wheel, or 42 per cent of the continent, making it a serious Antarctic force with three research stations on the continent: Davis, Mawson and Casey. But it is unable to thwart other nation states with polar ambitions from establishing bases on its territory. Some believe China is gearing up to make an Antarctic territorial claim, or even to withdraw from the treaty so that it can do as it likes. Others see such Sino-scepticism as “China bashing”. In this, it is no different from any other claimant state. The big American base at coastal McMurdo Sound, for example, is on New Zealand territory. Russia, China, Romania, France and Italy all have bases on Australian territory. But the three Chinese bases on Australian territory – Zhongshan, Taishan and Kunlun – have unnerved some critics because of the speed and scale of China’s Antarctic build-up, and its behaviour in the South China Sea. China gained voting rights in 1985. In the past 35 years it has built a total of five stations across Antarctica, all of which are potential receivers for China’s satellite navigation system, BeiDou, which could be used to guide missiles in wartime. Some believe China is gearing up to make an Antarctic territorial claim, or even to withdraw from the treaty so that it can do as it likes. Others see such Sino-scepticism as “China bashing”. But Chinese strategic intentions are notoriously difficult to read and whatever the truth, there is no doubt that Antarctic waters are viewed in Beijing as a valuable fishery. Antarctica also has abundant coal reserves. Its bedrock is believed to contain oil along with silver, copper, gold, nickel, platinum, iron ore, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, lead, titanium, nickel and uranium. East Antarctica was attached to the Great Australian Bight before the Gondwanan supercontinent broke up about 180 million years ago. “Whatever we’ve got, it’s got,” says an Australian polar expert who declines to be named. As the Antarctic ice sheet responds to global warming, a future in which it is mined draws closer. For the moment, mining is forbidden under a 1998 protocol to the Antarctic treaty, signed in Madrid. But in 2048, the Madrid protocol and its mining ban can be reviewed. In the lead-up, any of the 29 voting nations can request a review and propose changes. Legal experts believe it unlikely that any state, or coalition of states, would have the numbers to drive a change, which would require agreement by 75 per cent of relevant countries. University of Tasmania Associate Professor Jeffrey McGee, an expert in Antarctic law and policy, tells me: “It will likely be tough for any significant changes to be made to the environmental protocol.” Gentoo penguins are just one of a number of breeds in the area. These are thriving on Elephant Island and on the Antarctic Peninsula.Credit:Getty Images On my last day in the Antarctic, I wake shortly after dawn to find we’ve arrived at Elephant Island, the most northerly of the South Shetland group and the site of the Greenpeace penguin study. It was here that Shackleton’s second-in-command, Frank Wild, set up camp after the loss of their ship, The Endurance, in the Weddell Sea. Shackleton famously sailed for South Georgia in the seven-metre whaler James Caird, little more than a floating bathtub. He returned several months later to rescue Wild, who has a point named in his honour. It seems grotesque, at lighter moments simply absurd, to be surveying the scene of their ordeal – the men on Elephant Island survived on the seals and penguins that so delight tourists following in their wake – while tucking into a continental breakfast. During our briefing the previous night, marine biologist Tomasz Zadrozny, or Tomski as most of us know him, explained that Elephant Island, so named because it somewhat resembles a head and elephant trunk, normally conceals its charms beneath heavy fog. Today at dawn, the pale blue Antarctic sky is entirely cloudless – a thing of rare beauty in itself. Spread out beneath it is a restless ocean; a vast two-toned twill of cobalt and ultramarine. And between sea and sky extends a band of jewelled peaks casting morning shadows of deep mauve into creviced valleys. In a little over a week, I’ve witnessed a dramatic year-to-year loss of snow covering at various points along the peninsula, and not once have I worn my down jacket. I’ve sailed through a new record Antarctic high. Here, at Elephant Island, researchers have studied the long-term decline of a penguin species dependent on krill, a finding that raises profound questions about the Antarctic ecosystem. But I’ve also heard cheering news suggesting that reports of plastic pouring into the Southern Ocean are way off the mark. “We can’t be quibbling over geopolitics. We need to try to make sure that our planetary systems are not going to fail us.” That evening, with the sun lingering, I catch up with Claire Christian, executive director of the Washington, DC-based Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a global group of environmental bodies, in the ship’s lounge. I first met Christian, who is whip-smart with a BA in liberal arts and a master’s in international relations, in Hobart four months earlier. That day, she was weary and visibly strained. At the annual meeting of a body established to conserve Antarctic oceans – Christian had observer status – Russia and China had joined forces to stymie a proposal put forward by Australia and the European Union to establish a marine conservation zone in the East Antarctic. The move had failed for the eighth consecutive year. Designed to either ban or restrict fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, similar conservation zones have been established in the Subantarctic South Orkney Islands and the Ross Sea. The East Antarctic zone would have covered a million square kilometres in the oceans off the Australian territory. Some, including Australian Antarctic Division director Kim Ellis, envisage the establishment of a necklace of such protected areas giving an already stressed ecosystem a chance to revive. China, however, sees such proposals as part of a power play by countries like Australia with existing claims in Antarctica, while Russia tends to reject any conservation measure that will impede Antarctic fishing. Christian was distressed by what she saw as a lack of trust among members of the Antarctica community. “It’s very unfortunate, because we need that trust at a time of environmental crisis for the planet,” she told me. “We can’t be quibbling over geopolitics. We need to try to make sure that our planetary systems are not going to fail us.” Humpback whales spend their summers in Antarctica enjoying the krill.Credit:Getty Images She’s been on board the Amundsen these past few weeks as an appointee of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), bustling about the ship, and on land, with the unflagging zest of the Energiser bunny. Tonight, her work – a 20-page report on the ship’s compliance with the organisation’s guidelines – is done. We have both been in the same boat: as observers of a tourist venture, and tourists ourselves. She is well aware that the tourism industry has invested heavily in minimising its impact, and new technologies, such as the Amundsen’s hybrid part-battery engine, will make a difference. But these innovations and regulations are voluntary. Nothing in IAATO’s regulations can stop a rogue tour operator, just as nothing in the Antarctic treaty system can inhibit a rogue state. Even so, she emphasises that global warming remains the gravest threat to Antarctica. If warming were to continue at present rates, and resource-hungry states had enough support within the community of treaty signatories to change the environmental protocol, the frozen continent would, by 2048, face its doomsday scenario. “In 2048, if we’re really talking about opening up Antarctica to oil and gas exploration, we’re in serious trouble as a society,” says Christian as we slide past a shabby oil rig off the Patagonian coast. “All the evidence says we need to take resource exploration completely off the table and say, ‘I know it’s very tempting but that stuff is going to need to be left in the ground.’ If people really think that that is a viable option or a good idea, I’m not sure that humanity is intelligent enough to survive.” The next day I meet Christian at the airport in Santiago. With a somewhat resigned grimace, she tells me of the new record Antarctic temperature high of 20.75 degrees off the peninsula’s northern tip. It feels as if we have just witnessed what Antarctic observers most fear: the dreaded tipping point. The moment of no return. Time will tell. The writer visited Antarctica courtesy of Hurtigruten.

But this past summer, global warming and geopolitical manoeuvring have turned up the heat to dangerous levels. By Luke Slattery “Last-chance tourism” is how travel operators describe the urge of some to get to Antarctica “before it melts”.Credit:Getty Images A pair of humpback whales has been inspecting the expedition cruise ship Roald Amundsen, lying a notch below 65 degrees south in the mirrored waters of the Lemaire Channel. But they’ve had a change of mind. It’s our tiny Zodiac boat, little more than a high-tech tyre, that now intrigues them. The driver cuts the engine as the humpbacks draw closer. Every few minutes they surface to spout. The temperature today in the Antarctic Peninsula, a 1300-kilometre-long tendril of ice, snow and bedrock reaching towards the tip of South America, is close to freezing. Each blast from a humpback blowhole is followed by a plume of steam. Suddenly a barnacle-encrusted tail slices through the still black water, just out of reach. For the fearful, it’s too close for comfort; for the intrepid, it’s too good to be true. The leviathans slide beneath us, descending as steadily as elevators, and disappear. I study the depths, looking one way, then another. Nothing. Then, a scant few metres below, the larger of the two reappears, turning its immense white belly upwards like an outsized puppy begging for a scratch. It’s a remarkable moment in a defining – or redefining – Antarctic summer. A summer of discontent. For much of human history, the white continent has stood gloriously apart: an enchanted castle at the earth’s end, buttressed by ramparts of ice, with the gelid Southern Ocean for a protective moat. The highest, coldest, windiest, driest, loneliest continent has endured whaling and sealing and over-fishing since it was discovered 200 years ago. But Antarctica today confronts a cluster of threats – all man-made – that it is ill-equipped to withstand. Early this year, Antarctic summer temperatures spiked to improbable new heights, vaulting above 20 degrees: T-shirt weather. Glaciers on the west of the continent shrank at record rates and penguin species battled to survive. At the same time, nation states jostled for influence in a resource-rich and strategically sensitive region, while the number of travellers during the November-March tourism window soared. In all, nearly 78,000 tourists were scheduled to have sailed to Antarctica this season, more than double the number only a decade ago. A signpost at one of Antarctica’s 76 research stations: there are 40 year-round and 36 in summer. They are ostensibly there for research but also to tacitly shore up territorial claims or ambitions.Credit:Getty Images The season came to a dramatic close last month. When and how it resumes will depend in large measure on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the state of the post-viral cruise industry. But then, most Antarctic experts view tourism as a lesser threat to the polar environment than climate change and the possibility that the continent could be reduced to a fishery and a mine by the middle of this century. In late January, as I travelled to the Antarctic Peninsula for the second time in a year, the World Meteorological Organization warned that the volume of ice lost annually from the 14-million-square-kilometre continent, which locks up 90 per cent of the world’s fresh water in its frozen form, had increased at least sixfold since 1979. Almost a quarter of the rapidly thinning West Antarctic ice sheet is believed to be unstable, and satellites in late March revealed that the East Antarctic ice sheet – the larger of the two – is increasingly vulnerable. In the same few weeks at sea, news reached the Roald Amundsen that the world’s biggest iceberg, named A68 by the US National Ice Centre as if it were a robot from a Star Wars prequel, had done a runner. If and when it tips – a moment unlikely to be discernible until it’s already past – Antarctica will become an aggressive driver of climate change. In 2017, this Bali-sized berg calved from the Larsen C Ice Shelf, on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and for more than two years remained hemmed in by sea ice. But this southern summer it cut loose, gathered speed and began to drift north into open water. An alpha berg with a surface area of 5800 square kilometres in its prime, A68 will soon begin to splinter into bergy bits, growlers, shards and ice blocks before melting into an ocean already rising by an estimated three millimetres a year. A few months before this journey I visit the Australian Antarctic Division, a sprawling space station-like complex on Hobart’s southern fringe, for a briefing from its director, Kim Ellis. Though the effects of climate change are less visible across the Australian Antarctic Territory on the east of the continent, which Ellis administers, than on the western Antarctic Peninsula, where I’m headed, he has no doubt that warming on the continent is a concrete and not a spectral thing. The Antarctic is estimated to have lost three trillion tonnes of ice over the past 25 years and Ellis holds grave fears of an approaching tipping point. “As ocean salinity changes due to the melting ice sheet and freshwater run-off, so do ocean currents,” says the 64-year-old former army officer in a bright bureaucratic tone that conceals the gravity of this grim scenario. “The currents around the Antarctic are a major cooling factor. The Antarctic is the Earth’s airconditioner.” If and when it tips – a moment unlikely to be discernible until it’s already past – Antarctica will become an aggressive driver of climate change. A warming, melting Antarctic would likely propel global sea levels one to two metres higher by 2100, washing an erstwhile frozen continent to the doorstep of many coastal communities. Experts believe it would also stimulate a change in the direction and strength of the world’s big currents, and deplete oceanic oxygen levels and nutrition to the point where the Earth’s surface water would resemble a “marine desert”. In the same facility I meet the Australian Antarctic Division’s acting chief scientist, Dirk Welsford, who is dressed in jeans and a black T-shirt bearing a cartoon of a rather wan-looking penguin. He’s a marine ecologist and like his boss, bearded. Ellis sports a trimmed, almost Elizabethan beard; Welsford’s whiskers are more bearish. He stresses the dramatic temperature fluctuations on the continent between years, seasons and regions, preferring the term “climate strange” to “climate change”. “The key thing we’re seeing is that everything is less predictable than it used to be,” he explains. “The ice might break out earlier than normal, or later than normal. That’s the big message for us from climate change – it’s not a steady upward swing. It’s pulsing in unpredictable ways.” The new normal, for Welsford, is the abnormal. It is January 28 when I board the Roald Amundsen, a new hybrid-powered Norwegian tourist ship named after the country’s polar explorer who beat Briton Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole (Scott never returned). With 400-odd passengers aboard, it sets out from the Chilean city of Punta Arenas, cruises down fjords and enters the Drake Passage separating the southern tip of the Americas from the scenic South Shetland Islands 120 kilometres north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The ship steams with a rocking-horse motion over a five-metre swell. Outside, on deck, a high wind gives a throaty roar. Chunky skuas swoop and dive. The sky is lidded with a film of eerie grey, featureless cloud that seems fitting for a journey to a world apart. On our first dawn beyond the Drake Passage, we spy the South Shetlands. Our arrival is heralded by rafts of chubby penguins porpoising – dive and glide, dive and glide – to open sea. These endearing dart-shaped aquatic birds, the Antarctic’s best-loved mascots, thread their way across the water on resolute paths. They have been known to travel as far as 80 kilometres from their colonies to forage, and dive to great depths. The islands, a pile of majestic snow-caked volcanic peaks, very beautiful under a blue sky but often obscured by cloud, are the polar gateway for cruise ships and many of the 32 nations that maintain Antarctic research stations. The South Shetlands enjoy shorter winters and are relatively easily provisioned, making them the low-hanging fruit of Antarctic exploration and colonisation. On King George Island, the largest of the group, 10 countries maintain permanent research stations. The Russians have even built a church on King George, and in summer the island hosts an Antarctic marathon. The head of the Amundsen’s expedition team, marine biologist Tomasz Zadrozny, has wintered over on the Polish Arctowski station at King George, and he puts its summer population at about 600. We drop anchor metaphorically – the Hurtigruten ship prefers to use a GPS and its own engines to fix its place – and come ashore on King George at Half Moon Bay. The harbour supports a healthy rookery with plenty of downy grey gentoo and chinstrap penguin chicks, their undeveloped wings hanging limply by their sides like overlong sleeves. I watch a mother waddle up to her grey, downy chick, who is asleep standing upright. She approaches, steps back seeming to consider her next move, and gives her chick a jab in the chest with her bill as if to say: “No sleeping in, kid!” The chick wakes with a start, staggers, and shoots its parent a what the… glare. The “little people” of the Antarctic were described as an “object of endless pleasure and amusement” by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, whose memoir of Scott’s ill-fated expedition, The Worst Journey in the World, is a classic of Antarctic literature from the tragi-heroic age of exploration. I doubt if that description has been bettered. When I visited the South Shetlands 12 months earlier, at exactly the same time, the cloud was mean and low, a squall thrashed humans and wildlife alike, and the landscape was only partly visible. The weather today is clear. I take in pavlova peaks, coves and great sweeps of ice-strewn ocean. But while there is snow on the heights, there’s noticeably less on the flats. Danco Island last year, where the author struggled through knee-deep snow.Credit:Luke Slattery A few days later, we come ashore at another spot I visited a year ago, almost to the day. Danco Island rises from a marbled waterway encircled by glaciers. Among the lofty basalt crags the snow settles into pillowy drifts, white on white, splashed by the sun. Down by the shore, at their Colgate-coloured fringes, the glaciers groan and crack, calving off great tower blocks of ice. We disembark our Zodiacs in groups and trek up a hillock on well-defined paths to a penguin rookery. But something seems wrong. Last year, on the same rise, I struggled through knee-deep snow. This year there is barely any snow cover at the same height, and rivulets of snowmelt rush over bare rock to the shore. It is warm – unnervingly warm. Later, when I mention this to one of the ship’s scientists she adds a detail, in her French-inflected English: “Some of our group notice also that the chicks are very small, and there are not many.” A fellow traveller jokes he has taken the cruise to see Antarctica “before it melts”. As we sail around the peninsula I note variations on this theme: the white world is retreating rapidly in the summer months, replaced by a dappled patterning of white snow and black volcanic rock. A fellow traveller at a water bubbler jokes that he has taken the cruise to see Antarctica “before it melts”; a syndrome known in the travel industry as “last-chance tourism”. But it is no joking matter. On many important measures – ice-shelf cover, water temperature, glacial stability, political certainty, and the quality of mystery, at once alluring and sinister, that defined it in the human imagination when it was still barely known – the Antarctic Peninsula is shape-shifting. One of the fastest warming regions on the planet, the peninsula’s average temperature is estimated to have shot up by three degrees in the past 50 years. A few days after our landing at Danco Island, a dramatic event in our neighbourhood hammers home the threats facing the fifth largest continent, and the threat it in turn poses to the planet if it continues to warm at current rates. On February 6, a record Antarctic high of 18.3 degrees is logged at an Argentinian station about 170 kilometres away. Sailing on the opposite side of the Antarctic Peninsula, at the same latitude, the breeze is crisp but it’s warm enough for me to head out on deck without coat or hat in the early evening. From the upper deck, I photograph the new state-of-the-art Chinese-built Brazilian research station at King George Island’s Admiralty Bay. This facility, which replaces a base destroyed by fire in 2012 – two Brazilian soldiers were found dead in the ruins – stands as a tangible sign of China’s desire to extend its influence in Antarctica.

The scene shows there is barely any snow cover at the same height, and rivulets of snowmelt rush over bare rock to the shore.Credit:Luke Slattery We enter the Lemaire Channel – 11 kilometres long and a mere 1600 metres wide at its narrowest point – to find it choked with ice. Sailing at a suitably glacial pace, we encounter a Greenpeace vessel directly in our path. The Esperanza is on the Antarctic leg of a journey from the North Pole. Her purpose is to expose the polar impact of climate change, plastic pollution and industrial fishing on penguin colonies, whales and other marine life, and she has a team of independent researchers aboard. A week later Greenpeace releases its study of Antarctic chinstrap penguins, named for distinctive facial markings that give them a helmeted appearance. The results are dramatic. The number of chinstraps on Elephant Island in the South Shetlands has fallen almost 60 per cent since the last survey in 1971. Half a century ago, there were about 123,000 breeding pairs of plucky chinstraps on the island; this summer there were a mere 52,786. From the Amundsen I call one of the researchers on the Esperanza, Alexander Borowicz, an arctic ecologist from Stony Brook University in upstate New York. The most likely cause of the “significant decline” of chinstraps, he says, is a change in ocean conditions. “We’re seeing less sea ice in winter months on the Antarctic Peninsula and in summer, it melts off early.” According to the Australian Antarctic Division’s Dirk Welsford, it’s not clear why the sea ice decline is so bad for chinstraps. “It’s one of the big questions we don’t yet have an answer to.” Some scientists believe that, much like elderly gentlemen, this breed of penguin simply resist change: their numbers seem to decline wherever and whenever they encounter a novel climate. The krill fisheries, though regulated, worry some. But to most scientists, the ice retreat and glacial melt is a bigger threat to krill. Others identify a depletion of krill stocks, on which the penguins feed. Krill depend on masses of single-cell phytoplankton, and these microscopic creatures are nourished by algae beneath sea ice. If the sea ice retreats, and the ocean’s chemistry and temperature changes dramatically, the krill population will likely shrink. Krill is also fished in Antarctica by countries including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and Norway, for use in feed for farmed salmon as well as in fish oil tablets and bait. The krill fisheries, though regulated since 1981, worry some. But to most scientists, the ice retreat and glacial melt is a bigger threat to krill. Chinstraps are not the only species dependent on these tiny translucent crustaceans, which grow to about six centimetres in length and mass in vast orange-hued blooms, surfacing at dusk. Gentoo penguins, which are thriving on Elephant Island and elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula, enjoy a more varied diet, including fish. But adelie penguins, which appear to be moving to colder regions of the continent, are also dependent on krill. So, too, are whales, fish, seals and seabirds. In fact, much of the exuberant life of Antarctica exists because of krill, the underlying reason visitors to the frozen continent are awestruck by the sight of whales launching themselves into the air, cheered by the Chaplin-esque waddle of the penguin, delighted by the giant petrel’s airborne arabesques. If krill disappear from Antarctica, as Kim Ellis succinctly explains, “the whole thing falls over”. The chinstrap penguin census at Elephant Island casts a light on a confounding human dimension of the Antarctic’s agony: the relationship between truth, half-truth and lies; between belief, doubt and denial. Fritz Jantschke, the Amundsen’s resident zoologist – and a former curator of the Frankfurt Zoo – cautions against continent-wide conclusions drawn from such small “dramatic” studies. Chinstraps, he adds, remain the most populous penguin species in Antarctica, with more than four million breeding pairs. An Australian scientist, who declines to be named, dismisses as “ill-considered and unhelpful” an assertion made by ornithologist Noah Strycker, who is associated with the Greenpeace study, that “something” in the Southern Ocean is fundamentally “broken”. The importance of scientific sobriety is underscored by Bert van Bavel, research director at the Norwegian Water Institute, who is on board the Amundsen to study water temperature and marine litter. A few days before our journey, Sky News reported that hundreds of mostly microscopic pieces of plastic had been found per litre of sampled Antarctic seawater. Citing a study by the British Antarctic Survey, the story was headlined: “Big worry” as scientists find plastics “pouring” into Antarctica. “There have been two theories,” van Bavel explains from the Amundsen’s science centre – a lab and library open to the ship’s guests – after a fortnight collecting specimens in the Antarctic. The first is that the circumpolar current, which rotates clockwise and acts like an aquatic fridge door to maintain a cooler water temperature in the Southern Ocean, also protects Antarctica from introduced plastics and pollutants. “The other,” says van Bavel, an environmental chemist, “is that plastics are here – and that’s why I’m here.” After a pause for dramatic effect, he goes on with a reassuring smile. “Our samples so far have found very few plastic fibres. We’ve found perhaps two or three particles per 10,000 litres of water. Some samples have been completely negative. This, of course, is good news for the Antarctic.” Van Bavel suspects that the findings of the British survey come from contaminated samples. “There are fibres everywhere,” he says plucking at his plaid shirt, “in my clothing; in your clothing.” Paradise Bay, on Antarctica’s west coast. Australia’s territory, in the east, covers 42 per cent of the continent. Credit:Getty Images Two centuries have passed since the Antarctic Peninsula was first sighted by Russian explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen. That Russian triumph, like most things in Antarctica, is hotly disputed. The year 1820 was a big one for Antarctic exploration and three days later, on January 30, the Anglo-Irish sailor Edward Bransfield spied the peninsula’s northernmost islands. “The British and the Russians still argue about it [who got there first],” remarks German biologist Manfred Reinke, one of the specialists on board the Amundsen. “It’s as if it happened yesterday.” Tall, with a broad face and a slightly bowl-cut fringe lending him a boyish air, Reinke is the former executive secretary of the body that manages the Antarctic Treaty System. Established in 1959 and open to any member of the United Nations, the treaty had, as of last year, been signed by 54 nations. A group of 29 – original signatories and nations strong in Antarctic research – have voting rights. Among the 12 original signatories are seven nations with territorial claims, including Australia, which has the largest claim. The treaty declares that Antarctica will be used solely for “peaceful purposes” and effectively freezes the territorial ambitions of those seven countries: Argentina, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and Australia. At the same time, it freezes counter-claims and challenges by the other signatories. Because voting parties need a scientific presence there, the treaty has become a stimulus to scientific – and pseudo-scientific – activity. Any nation wishing to have skin in the Antarctic game needs a research presence on the ice. As a consequence, the continent is littered with 76 stations– 40 year-round and 36 summer – ostensibly for research but tacitly to shore up territorial claims or ambitions. Instead of an arms escalation, Antarctica faces a boffin build-up. It is no longer, in the words of British Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, one of the “void spaces of the world” to which adventurers are drawn by the “mysterious fascination of the unknown”. Rather, it has become an extreme-weather multinational colony with a seasonal rotation of staff. Manfred Reinke believes research stations used by states mainly to assert their presence in Antarctica, together with new stations built by nations wanting to become voting members, and increased tourism, are combining to place a “burden” on a continent already badly affected by climate change. “International cooperation should focus on operating a few international stations, thus relieving the continent of waste, refuse and pollution,” he says. A drastic reduction in the number of stations, and a boost in scientific collaboration along the line of international space stations, would certainly help to reduce the human footprint in Antarctica. Australia lays claim to a near six-million-square-kilometre slice of the Antarctic cheese wheel, or 42 per cent of the continent, making it a serious Antarctic force with three research stations on the continent: Davis, Mawson and Casey. But it is unable to thwart other nation states with polar ambitions from establishing bases on its territory. Some believe China is gearing up to make an Antarctic territorial claim, or even to withdraw from the treaty so that it can do as it likes. Others see such Sino-scepticism as “China bashing”. In this, it is no different from any other claimant state. The big American base at coastal McMurdo Sound, for example, is on New Zealand territory. Russia, China, Romania, France and Italy all have bases on Australian territory. But the three Chinese bases on Australian territory – Zhongshan, Taishan and Kunlun – have unnerved some critics because of the speed and scale of China’s Antarctic build-up, and its behaviour in the South China Sea. China gained voting rights in 1985. In the past 35 years it has built a total of five stations across Antarctica, all of which are potential receivers for China’s satellite navigation system, BeiDou, which could be used to guide missiles in wartime. Some believe China is gearing up to make an Antarctic territorial claim, or even to withdraw from the treaty so that it can do as it likes. Others see such Sino-scepticism as “China bashing”. But Chinese strategic intentions are notoriously difficult to read and whatever the truth, there is no doubt that Antarctic waters are viewed in Beijing as a valuable fishery. Antarctica also has abundant coal reserves. Its bedrock is believed to contain oil along with silver, copper, gold, nickel, platinum, iron ore, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc, manganese, lead, titanium, nickel and uranium. East Antarctica was attached to the Great Australian Bight before the Gondwanan supercontinent broke up about 180 million years ago. “Whatever we’ve got, it’s got,” says an Australian polar expert who declines to be named. As the Antarctic ice sheet responds to global warming, a future in which it is mined draws closer. For the moment, mining is forbidden under a 1998 protocol to the Antarctic treaty, signed in Madrid. But in 2048, the Madrid protocol and its mining ban can be reviewed. In the lead-up, any of the 29 voting nations can request a review and propose changes. Legal experts believe it unlikely that any state, or coalition of states, would have the numbers to drive a change, which would require agreement by 75 per cent of relevant countries. University of Tasmania Associate Professor Jeffrey McGee, an expert in Antarctic law and policy, tells me: “It will likely be tough for any significant changes to be made to the environmental protocol.” Gentoo penguins are just one of a number of breeds in the area. These are thriving on Elephant Island and on the Antarctic Peninsula.Credit:Getty Images On my last day in the Antarctic, I wake shortly after dawn to find we’ve arrived at Elephant Island, the most northerly of the South Shetland group and the site of the Greenpeace penguin study. It was here that Shackleton’s second-in-command, Frank Wild, set up camp after the loss of their ship, The Endurance, in the Weddell Sea. Shackleton famously sailed for South Georgia in the seven-metre whaler James Caird, little more than a floating bathtub. He returned several months later to rescue Wild, who has a point named in his honour. It seems grotesque, at lighter moments simply absurd, to be surveying the scene of their ordeal – the men on Elephant Island survived on the seals and penguins that so delight tourists following in their wake – while tucking into a continental breakfast. During our briefing the previous night, marine biologist Tomasz Zadrozny, or Tomski as most of us know him, explained that Elephant Island, so named because it somewhat resembles a head and elephant trunk, normally conceals its charms beneath heavy fog. Today at dawn, the pale blue Antarctic sky is entirely cloudless – a thing of rare beauty in itself. Spread out beneath it is a restless ocean; a vast two-toned twill of cobalt and ultramarine. And between sea and sky extends a band of jewelled peaks casting morning shadows of deep mauve into creviced valleys. In a little over a week, I’ve witnessed a dramatic year-to-year loss of snow covering at various points along the peninsula, and not once have I worn my down jacket. I’ve sailed through a new record Antarctic high. Here, at Elephant Island, researchers have studied the long-term decline of a penguin species dependent on krill, a finding that raises profound questions about the Antarctic ecosystem. But I’ve also heard cheering news suggesting that reports of plastic pouring into the Southern Ocean are way off the mark. “We can’t be quibbling over geopolitics. We need to try to make sure that our planetary systems are not going to fail us.” That evening, with the sun lingering, I catch up with Claire Christian, executive director of the Washington, DC-based Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, a global group of environmental bodies, in the ship’s lounge. I first met Christian, who is whip-smart with a BA in liberal arts and a master’s in international relations, in Hobart four months earlier. That day, she was weary and visibly strained. At the annual meeting of a body established to conserve Antarctic oceans – Christian had observer status – Russia and China had joined forces to stymie a proposal put forward by Australia and the European Union to establish a marine conservation zone in the East Antarctic. The move had failed for the eighth consecutive year. Designed to either ban or restrict fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, similar conservation zones have been established in the Subantarctic South Orkney Islands and the Ross Sea. The East Antarctic zone would have covered a million square kilometres in the oceans off the Australian territory. Some, including Australian Antarctic Division director Kim Ellis, envisage the establishment of a necklace of such protected areas giving an already stressed ecosystem a chance to revive. China, however, sees such proposals as part of a power play by countries like Australia with existing claims in Antarctica, while Russia tends to reject any conservation measure that will impede Antarctic fishing. Christian was distressed by what she saw as a lack of trust among members of the Antarctica community. “It’s very unfortunate, because we need that trust at a time of environmental crisis for the planet,” she told me. “We can’t be quibbling over geopolitics. We need to try to make sure that our planetary systems are not going to fail us.” Humpback whales spend their summers in Antarctica enjoying the krill.Credit:Getty Images She’s been on board the Amundsen these past few weeks as an appointee of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), bustling about the ship, and on land, with the unflagging zest of the Energiser bunny. Tonight, her work – a 20-page report on the ship’s compliance with the organisation’s guidelines – is done. We have both been in the same boat: as observers of a tourist venture, and tourists ourselves. She is well aware that the tourism industry has invested heavily in minimising its impact, and new technologies, such as the Amundsen’s hybrid part-battery engine, will make a difference. But these innovations and regulations are voluntary. Nothing in IAATO’s regulations can stop a rogue tour operator, just as nothing in the Antarctic treaty system can inhibit a rogue state. Even so, she emphasises that global warming remains the gravest threat to Antarctica. If warming were to continue at present rates, and resource-hungry states had enough support within the community of treaty signatories to change the environmental protocol, the frozen continent would, by 2048, face its doomsday scenario. “In 2048, if we’re really talking about opening up Antarctica to oil and gas exploration, we’re in serious trouble as a society,” says Christian as we slide past a shabby oil rig off the Patagonian coast. “All the evidence says we need to take resource exploration completely off the table and say, ‘I know it’s very tempting but that stuff is going to need to be left in the ground.’ If people really think that that is a viable option or a good idea, I’m not sure that humanity is intelligent enough to survive.” The next day I meet Christian at the airport in Santiago. With a somewhat resigned grimace, she tells me of the new record Antarctic temperature high of 20.75 degrees off the peninsula’s northern tip. It feels as if we have just witnessed what Antarctic observers most fear: the dreaded tipping point. The moment of no return. Time will tell. The writer visited Antarctica courtesy of Hurtigruten.

Rain is expected to stay away from Sydney throughout next week, but temperatures are set to drop to under 20 degrees in parts of the city. Over the past month, rainfall was above average across NSW, with some areas getting nearly double the amount of rain compared with an average March. Widespread rainfall as a result of ex-Tropical Cyclone Esther early in the month, as well as another inland trough later on, contributed to the larger-than-usual total.

18,/environment/climate-change/remarkable-jump-in-solar-pv-installations-even-as-power-prices-eased-20200402-p54gai.html,'Remarkable' jump in solar PV installations even as power prices eased,"Australians installed solar panels on their roofs at a record rate last month, soaring almost half as much again as in March a year earlier, before the coronavirus began affecting supply and demand. Last month, installers registered 54 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic systems of 100 kilowatts or smaller, 44 per cent more than in March 2019, according to analysis of data from the Clean Energy Regulator by consultants, Green Energy Markets. Rooftop solar panel installations soared to record highs in both March and the first quarter of 2020.Credit:Vicky Hughson ""To have 40 per cent growth on the same period in 2019 - and last year was seen as exceptional - is really remarkable,"" Tristan Edis, an analyst with Green Energy Markets, said. ""It's above what we were expecting."" The new capacity, which included 32,000 individual systems, was also up almost a fifth on the February tally - the previous record monthly total. ""The total capacity registered over this first quarter was 672MW, which is 38 per cent higher than the same period last year and a staggering 300 per cent higher than the average of the first-quarter installs from 2015 to 2018,"" Mr Edis said, adding that capacity would be enough to meet the electricity consumption of about 175,000 homes. The increase in systems so far this year has been national in scope, led by NSW with Queensland and Victoria vying for second place. Mr Edis said that if the rate of installations were to continue through 2020, the extra capacity would be the equivalent of adding more than a third of the size of AGL's 1660MW coal-fired Liddell power station earmarked for closure in 2023. He cautioned, though, that January-March figures did not yet reflect the impact of COVID-19 on economic and consumer sentiment into the future. ""There are typically lags of around a month between when a system is installed and when it is registered with the Clean Energy Regulator, so these numbers reflect the market largely before the government’s social-distancing measures and the spike in unemployment that has unfolded,"" Mr Edis said. Even so, ""if sales were to drop in half from first-quarter levels, we’d still manage to install a greater amount of capacity than the Hazelwood Power Station [which was shut in 2017] over 2020"", he said. Green Energy Markets had been expecting a drop in new PV installations this year after 2019's surge by more than a third to a new high. For one thing, retail electricity prices have stopped rising or even eased back, removing one incentive for consumers to snap up solar. Secondly, the rapid roll-out of systems had potentially saturated markets. Peter Hannam writes on environment issues for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.
