The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. The terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. ""The aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,"" she said in a statement. ""We will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time."" AAP NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed one person in NSW, who is critically ill with coronavirus, is on ECMO. Here's a lay person description of how ECMO works: extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) takes over a patient's lung or heart function, reoxygenating their blood and removing carbon dioxide externally. Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. The state’s healthcare workers will now get free parking at hospitals in a bid to ease the pressure on those working on the COVID-19 frontline. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said all staff rostered to work at hospitals, including cleaners, security staff, allied health workers as well as nurses and doctors, will have access to the free parking from today. “It is critical that our frontline workers are able to access their place of work as easily as possible and we are taking these measures to ensure that is the case,” he said. Mr Hazzard said local councils were also working to help improve parking near health facilities. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was doing “whatever we can” to support hospital staff. “We hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.” Maureen Jacotine 86 year old resident of Uniting's Aldersgate aged care facility began crying while speaking with her family via Zoom. Credit:SMH Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services where designed for, with the former optimised for business meetings and the latter emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online. While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, Tim Biggs has some tips to stay safe. For Zoom: Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. For Houseparty: Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. More than 60,000 Australians a day are not turning up for their routine pathology tests, as restrictions on movement, fear of coronavirus and a misperception that services are overwhelmed keep them away. Pathologists have reported a 40 per cent drop in the number of routine tests performed in recent weeks for conditions including cancer, diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, according to the Royal College of Pathologists Australasia. If these tests are skipped, their condition could deteriorate to the point that they need to be hospitalised, the college warned. GP  Allison Bielawski giving a flu shot to patient Lily Bardsley 24, at her practice in Glebe. Credit:James Brickwood Dr Debra Graves, CEO of the college said there was an assumption that routine tests and medical appointments were not happening because of health services being busy with COVID-19, or that it was not safe to go for a test when you need one. “We want to reassure Australians that pathology is still here providing the tests that you need every day. Your health is our priority,” Dr Graves said. Earlier this week Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy urged Australians not to ignore any other health issues they have during the coronavirus pandemic, saying some general practitioners are raising alarms over a sudden drop in patients and “a lot of people with chronic diseases” were not going to their check-ups. ""They're very worried that people are so frightened that they're not seeking medical attention,"" Professor Murphy said. “This is a very concerning issue … please don’t neglect general health conditions at the moment. That is a really important message."" Dr Graves also urged anyone with a chronic condition who needs regular pathology tests or anyone worried about symptoms they have developed to contact their GP and arrange a telehealth consultation if they can’t get to an appointment. ""We know that measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 will continue for some months and people need to continue looking after their health during this time,"" Dr Graves said. She said COVID-19 testing samples are generally only performed in designated locations, either at a dedicated site or a location separated from general pathology collection. “Pathology providers are experts in detecting infectious diseases ... This includes collection centres where strict hygiene, appropriate distancing and separation measures are in place,” Dr Graves said. Police have handed out almost 50 fines of $1000 for breaching social distancing restrictions in the last 24 hours, and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said any breaches of the rules will not be tolerated. “These people need to be sent a very clear message that it won't be tolerated, it won't be tolerated by the police or the community,” he said.“If you choose to go against what most people in the community think is a reasonable consideration with the situation that we're faced with COVID-19, police will take action.” Police last week speaking to a man who refused to leave Bondi Beach..Credit:Edwina Pickles From today, NSW Police are also able to issue a $5000 on-the-spot fine for spitting or coughing on health workers or police officers. “I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. He said the fine was unprecedented, but “it reflects the community disgust”. “It is absolutely disgusting to think that anybody would think it's OK to cough or spit on a police officer or a health worker at any time, let alone in the world's worst virus crisis for a hundred years,” Mr Hazzard said. “So, $5000, you should be very lucky, you're getting off lightly.” Mr Worboys gave a “big thank you” to people staying at home this Easter. But he added police would be out in force this long weekend, keeping their eyes peeled for people travelling away from home. “Right across country NSW, and, indeed, in and around the urban area here, police have been vigilant around people towing caravans, people with trailers and quad bikes and camping gear, people with surfboards,” he said. Mr Worboys said police near border towns were also on the lookout for vehicles with Queensland and Victorian licence plates “moving into the state for holiday activities”. “If you don’t have an excuse to travel you will be issued with a $1000 fine,” he said. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed a 69-year-old man has died at John Hunter Hospital in NSW overnight, raising the national coronavirus death toll to 53. One of NSW’s critically ill coronavirus patients is on ECMO, Mr Hazzard said. “ECMO, of course, is a higher level of need for the patient, extra corporeal oxygenation, making sure your organs are being oxygenated,” he said. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state has seen a “very modest” increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was “fantastic” the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday.

Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state has seen a “very modest” increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was “fantastic” the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys are providing an update on COVID-19.

When Bishop met her British counterpart outside his ministerial grace-and-favour pad in central London, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace, he had a surprise for the Australian foreign affairs minister. It was a shirt emblazoned with one message: “Save the pangolin”. Ending the illegal wildlife trade, including that of the pangolin, was then one of Johnson’s pet projects.

Credit:Twitter/Julie Bishop As Johnson shuffled along, a bit like his new favourite animal, the fitter Bishop could be heard telling the British foreign secretary “We’ve got lots of discussions post-Brexit”, including a free-trade agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. “When I visited him later that day he had a big stuffed furry animal, a pangolin, on his desk,” Bishop tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “So he was very keen that we save this animal that was facing extinction, or so he believed. That was one of his causes there for a while, I’m not sure he is still in that frame of mind.” Bishop says it never crossed her mind that one of the reasons to stop the live animal trade was to prevent a worldwide crisis like COVID-19. While the virus likely originated in bats, it is probable that it passed to humans through another mammal at a wet market in Wuhan, China. The gentle, toothless pangolin - the most trafficked animal on the planet - is shaping up as the unwitting culprit. A little over two years later, Johnson is in a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, struck down by a virus that may have spread to humans by the very mammal he was trying to save. The prime minister’s hospitalisation this week has hit Britain’s resolve when it needed inspiration from its larger-than-life leader. It has also exposed a potential flaw in the British system; with its lack of written constitution and codified order of succession for the prime ministership, there is now a leadership vacuum at a time when some of the most important decisions in the nation’s history need to be made. It has left the world without the one leader who could credibly serve as a bridge between US President Donald Trump and Europe. And as the world enters an uncertain and pivotal few months, it has also highlighted the need to spare global leaders from this lethal virus as they try to stop its spread. Replay   As Johnson was rushed to St Thomas' Hospital in central London this week, his foreign secretary Dominic Raab was asked to deputise for him “where necessary”. Raab declined to answer questions about the extent of his powers, which has only served to create more uncertainty in a week when the nation’s death tally soared to more than 7000. The fact that the reins have been handed over to Raab, a relative unknown until a few years ago, is an indictment on the bitter politics of Brexit, of which Johnson cannot escape significant responsibility. Brexit has left a hollowed-out Conservative Party in its wake. If David Cameron went down, the country would have turned to ministerial heavyweights like George Osborne, Theresa May or William Hague to fill the void. Britain now only has one credible leader, and he is still recovering in a hospital bed. Around the world, governments are taking the threat of their leaders falling victim to COVID-19 seriously. In Australia, there are limits on the amount of people allowed into Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office and everyone entering must use hand sanitiser. All leadership meetings and all meetings not involving staff employed within the office are conducted on screens rather than in person. Morrison is also receiving regular medical check-ups. Succumbing to illness at a time of global crisis is not new, but it is the first time it has occurred in generations. Aides to British PM David Lloyd George feared he wouldn't make it to the end of World War I after he fell ill speaking in Manchester, a centre of the Spanish flu epidemic. World War II took such a toll on Australia's John Curtin and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt they didn't survive to see the end of it. Britain's Winston Churchill suffered a heart attack during the height of the war in 1941 and contracted pneumonia two years later, before having a serious stroke in his second spell as prime minister a decade later. Herve Lemahieu, director of the power and diplomacy program at the Lowy Institute, says Britain’s system of politics had not been designed for a contingency such as this. The order of succession for American presidents is set out in the US constitution, while Australia’s major parties have always had deputy prime ministers who can be called upon by the Governor-General in the event of the leader falling ill. Raab, as “first secretary of state”, would become the British government’s de facto leader if the prime minister could not carry out his duties, but he has only been “deputised” by Johnson. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab  leaves 10 Downing Street on Thursday.Credit:Getty Images “Dominic Raab is notable in terms of his ascent - he was relatively little known and I would argue a second-rate politician that really came to fore only as a result of a whole generation of more experienced and competent politicians within the Tory party having been purged as result of Brexit politics,” Lemahieu says. “Already being foreign secretary was a huge promotion for him. I don't think anyone, least of all Raab and particularly Boris Johnson, ever assumed he would be filling in as prime minister."" Bishop says she was “shocked” to see Johnson was transferred to intensive care this week, and it was “deeply concerning” to have the leader of one of the world’s largest economies “and most significant nations” struck down during the crisis. “What I think we see at present is that not only the British people, but the world at large, want Boris to get healthy as soon as possible,” she says. “It is vital that nations feel confident that their leaders are healthy and are in charge of coordinating the response effectively to the global pandemic, and a loss of confidence in government would have important implications as people would be more likely to be concerned about the responses that they are being required to undertake that could worsen the crisis.” According to colleagues who have worked with Johnson, the 55-year-old prime minister has always hated the thought of illness. Perhaps it is this disregard that led him to last month boast about shaking hands with coronavirus victims in hospital. It is the same contempt for mortality that he admires in his hero Churchill. In his 2015 book, The Churchill Factor, Johnson wrote that Britain’s prime minister carried on “through sheer force of will” after his 1953 stroke, insisting on trying to organise a summit between the Americans and Russians. “The story of Churchill’s last years in office is not of some giant red sun, heat gone, sinking slowly out of sight,” Johnson wrote. “He is no volcano puttering himself to extinction. He is Tennyson’s Ulysses - always struggling, striving, seeking: always convinced that some deed of note may yet be done. It is a story of unbelievable courage and willpower - and cunning.” Boris Johnson pictured chairing a recent COVID-19 meeting remotely.Credit:AP Bishop says Johnson would find it “very frustrating” to be incapacitated. “He is so full of energy, he is always in a hurry, Boris is always rushing to the next issue, to the next event. His enthusiasm is infectious and I certainly always enjoyed his company,” she says. “He was endlessly entertaining and intellectually challenging, but he is also great company, and he seems to thrive on having ideas and challenges in front of him that he can tackle."" Bishop first met Johnson in 2012 when he was mayor of London, but the two struck up a rapport when they were both in the foreign portfolios.  A year before their early-morning jog, they met prior to a press conference in London. Bishop was confronted with Johnson's blond hair in its signature dishevelled state and his French designer necktie askew. “The short part of the tie was at the front of the tie and the big Hermes label was sitting out there and I said: ‘Boris, this will never do, we cannot do a press conference on Brexit with you so obviously displaying a French designer tie’,” Bishop recalls. “He gives the impression that he cares not a jot for his appearance.” Bishop says Johnson’s “clever wit and sense of humour” belies a deep and serious thinker. She has always warned colleagues not to underestimate Johnson, saying he has a “formidable intellect” and a “very interesting and compelling leadership style”. The temporary loss of Johnson also means Australia is without one of its biggest fans. The British PM spent his gap year before university as a tutor at Geelong Grammar in 1983. As foreign secretary, he heeded Australia’s calls for Britain to re-engage in the Pacific, creating three new diplomatic posts in the region. Bishop says Johnson is a “great friend of Australia” and has always been a “rock of support” whenever the country has needed it. On Thursday night, Johnson was moved out of intensive care and was said to be in “extremely good spirits”. It is believed he may need as long as a month to return to work and, even then, may have to return to full duties gradually. Johnson’s illness has reminded the country that this virus doesn’t discriminate and is as potentially crippling for a factory worker in Birmingham as an old Etonian in Downing Street. While the news has shocked Britain, it has also united a bitterly divided nation behind its leader. Through his suffering he has endeared himself to the public in a way no thumping election victory can. It will now fall to him to pick up the country on his shoulders, and once again shuffle forwards.

Parliament has set a legislated deadline in the fight against the coronavirus by approving a six-month sunset clause for the new $130 billion JobKeeper wage subsidy. Illustration: Jim Pavlidis
Credit:  The boost to confidence is significant when the economic support is combined with the sharp fall in new infections. But this virus sets its own timetable. While the politicians offer reassurance, the scientists urge vigilance. And it is worth heeding the science. The medical experts who advise the government expect this threat to continue in waves for years. Even if we eradicate the disease in Australia, says James McCaw of the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, the virus will spread around the world and easily return. “That epidemic in some places may also go locally extinct after a small or a large wave,” he says. “But it’s almost implausible to imagine this virus going extinct globally, which means that it will be here to stay. It will become a part of our everyday life and the transition to it not being a huge driver of complete societal change is a very difficult thing to work through.” Complete societal change. Good luck putting a six-month deadline on that. McCaw is a mathematical biologist. His colleague at the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, Jodie McVernon, is a doctor and epidemiologist. Together they led the scientific work that underpinned the government modelling released this week. The public modelling was underwhelming because it was based on overseas data from weeks ago, but this highlights the way huge decisions had to be made in rapid succession with limited data in recent weeks. There are good questions about the work so far. Why is there no public modelling using local case numbers? When can we know whether closing a bar is more effective than shutting a school? The answers will take weeks. The truth is the country’s top scientists are working under immense pressure to focus a microscope on a moving target. Their advice this week, in a teleconference held after Scott Morrison released the modelling, was to be wary of assumptions about what happens next. So the way out is yet to be found. Morrison rejects the strategy of herd immunity – the idea the country could be resistant after the infection reached perhaps 60 per cent of the population – and Health Minister Greg Hunt aims to keep infections well below 2.9 million people (the implied figure in the most benign published scenario). But they also know that suppressing the virus for too long will drag out the economic damage. A point comes where too many restrictions will work against the country as a whole, and where calculations are made about the cost of saving lives. The medical experts are grappling with this challenge. “There is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm,” wrote Tony Blakely, a University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology (but not one of the Doherty Institute team) for The Conversation this week. “Lockdowns, for example, cause drops in GDP and increases in unemployment. That feeds back on to changes in suicide and heart disease. We need to quantify that, and weigh it up.” This will be the next phase in the debate. With more modelling about the shutdowns, rather than the virus alone, the argument will shift towards easing the constraints. Inside the Morrison government, one of the worries is that the economic damage could kill more people than the virus. The solution is to relax the restrictions in stages and in different locations. Morrison may want this but cannot dictate the terms. The states and territories will make their own decisions because each has a different case load. It is tempting but misguided to debate a simple calculation – how many lives are worth sacrificing at the altar of the economy? – but the fact is that most of the cost cannot be avoided. The world economy is in shock. Australia cannot stop the slump. Even so, nobody should be naive about the decisions political leaders and their governments must make in this crisis. They have rejected herd immunity but they have not promised eradication; their objective is to manage the deaths without overloading the hospitals. If the scientists are right, the recovery will not run as the politicians wish. While the Parliament’s new law stops the wage subsidies on the last Sunday in September, the virus is a law unto itself. Even if the government halts the JobKeeper payment of $1500 a fortnight, can it really halve the JobSeeker payment of $1100 a fortnight – that is, return to the old Newstart rate – six months from now? Replay   It seems unlikely. It would require Morrison to put jobless Australians back on the old subsistence rate when independent economist Saul Eslake forecasts the ranks of the unemployed will double to almost 1.4 million. The recovery will not be swift enough to make that decision easy. Restaurants may reopen one day but the borders will remain closed. It will be Fortress Australia all this year and beyond. That is why “sovereignty” was Morrison’s key word in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday. Can Australia grow at all when it is locked off from the world? That may be the experiment until a vaccine arrives. McVernon and McCaw are trying to prepare Australians for a lasting change. McCaw cites the Spanish influenza of a century ago as a warning. That epidemic arrived in three waves over nine months but did not stop there. “For the next five or six years there were elevated levels of disease activity from that same virus as it settled down and became a part of our ecosystem,” he says. “And then it was there for decades afterwards.” It is an ugly ecosystem. It is also the future. David Crowe is the chief political correspondent for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Most people infected in the viral pandemic now sweeping the globe will come down with only a mild case of the mystery illness. Some won’t know they’ve had it at all. But when it's bad, it can mount an attack on the whole body – and start a storm in the lungs. How it plays out depends on the two factors important to any invasion: the strength of your defences and the strength (or dose) of what you’ve been hit with. Connor Reed, 25, knows well the racking cough and spiking fever of the illness now called COVID-19. He says he came down with it late last year in the centre of the initial outbreak, Wuhan in China. He still lives just a 20-minute walk from the wet market where it's believed the strain jumped from wild animals into humans.  At first, Reed seemed to just have a cold. A week on, then early December, he was already feeling better when a fever hit, and a cough. His whole body started to ache. Another week went by. He thought he was on the mend until the cough became deeper, seeming to settle at the bottom of his lungs. ""It was hard to breathe,"" Reed says. ""Even walking to the bathroom, I felt like I was running out of air. My ears hurt from it, I lost my balance at times. It started to get scary, like the worst flu I've ever had."" Reed ended up in hospital and, after a full day of testing, he says doctors told him he had a ""new kind of pneumonia"". Fortunately, he was fit and healthy: his life didn't appear to be in danger. Steroid inhalers helped reduce inflammation in his lungs and, more than a month after that first sniffle, Reed recovered. When he called the hospital in early January to ask more about his test results, they told him what was about to hit headlines around the world in just a matter of days – a new kind of coronavirus had been identified in humans. Reed was one of the earliest suspected cases. Four months on, what do we now know about COVID-19 and how the body reacts? What is treatment like? And how long does recovery take? Connor Reed, 25, in Wuhan, China. Having recovered from one of the earliest suspected cases of the coronavirus COVID-19, he is hoping to return to Brisbane, Australia.Credit:Facebook You can’t see the virus with the naked eye – it’s nanometres wide. But when someone is infected, they can shed it, shooting viral particles at least a metre into the air in water droplets from their nose and mouth, usually through coughing or sneezing. Viruses infect a new host by harnessing our own cellular machinery to replicate. To get in, they need the key – a receptor within a cell they can bind to. Which cell a virus latches onto largely determines where it will spread throughout the body – and helps guide treatment. The four main coronaviruses found in humans tend to colonise only the nose and throat. Collectively, they cause about one in four cases of the common cold and symptoms are mild: a runny nose, a sore throat, sometimes a cough or a fever. But since 2003, three dangerous coronavirus illnesses have emerged in humans: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also spawned global panic when it exploded onto the scene 20 years ago, the more deadly but less common MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and now the latest, COVID-19, which has already infected more than 1.5 million people and killed about 95,000. All three attack the lungs as well as the sinuses, sometimes developing into viral pneumonia – and, because they're new, there's little natural immunity to fight them off. COVID-19 is about 75 per cent similar to the SARS strain, and even thought to bind to the same cell receptors (ACE2), which are largely found in the lungs. Early studies suggest this virus might be better at hacking into that receptor than SARS, which is why it's more infectious, says Professor Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. A spokesman for the Australian Department of Health offered a different theory: the new virus appears to be replicating fastest in the nose and throat, rather than the lungs. That could make it more transmissible but also perhaps less fatal than the other two coronavirus outbreaks. To find the virus, doctors need to catch it in the act, either by swabbing a sample directly from the nose and throat or in lung phlegm or by singling out the body’s immune response to the infection in a blood test. The new strain has already been found in the lungs, nose, throat, even in faeces, says infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre. It can hitch a ride in the bloodstream to other organs such as the kidneys, liver, intestines and possibly the heart, brain and central nervous system, too. But both methods of testing can return false negatives - a throat or nasal swab can miss the virus (because it's actually replicating lower down in the lungs) and a blood test, which is not yet widely available outside of China, can be performed too early - some people will take up to 9 days to produce antibodies to fight off a virus. Professor Lewin adds, ""Early on, you had doctors in China diagnosing just off chest scans because you can see that lung inflammation, even if it's not severe."" Now, Sydney scientists have developed a fast training tool to help frontline healthcare workers spot COVID-19 in lung scans. Still, infectious disease physician and microbiologist Professor Peter Collignon says it’s not yet clear if everyone gets the new virus in their lungs. “Finding it down there isn't a tipping point [for severity] by any means. Some children have it in their lungs but display no symptoms,"" he says. ""But it might not have travelled all the way down from the upper respiratory area in every case."" Much of what we know about COVID-19 comes from studies of the first 55,000-odd cases in China, which found more than 80 per cent of people could fight off the illness without serious complications, even if they developed pneumonia. Lungs cleared, coughs eased and fevers broke. Anecdotally, some people have likened the infection to ""three weeks in hell"", racked by chills and struggling to breathe, while others have reported only a sore throat, a small cough, even no symptoms at all. Hollywood actor Tom Hanks offered an early public glimpse into life as a COVID-19 patient on March 11 when he revealed he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had both tested positive while in Australia shooting his latest film From hospital isolation on the Gold Coast, Hanks wrote of the illness's onset: ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too."" More public figures from actor Idris Elba to Prime Minister Boris Johnson have since been diagnosed. ""I've developed mild symptoms,"" Johnson said from isolation at home on March 27. ""That is to say, a fever and a persistent cough."" When his fever remained high more than 10 days later, he was moved to hospital, and then briefly into intensive care, but he now remains stable back in his ward. Based on data collected in China, most patients seem to have: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat, and nausea or diarrhoea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS. Less than five per cent of cases so far involve a blocked nose. With early symptoms deceptively similar to the common cold or flu, one sign of infection may be a loss of smell (and an accompanying reduction in taste), as the virus attacks that part of the respiratory system. Sometimes people infected with the virus who otherwise feel fine will find they cannot smell as usual - though experts say the effects are not permanent and the sudden loss of the sense is far from a ""test"" for the virus. (Not all patients report losing smell and the symptom is also associated with other common colds and viruses). In the case of COVID-19, Professor Collignon says patients generally appear to have mild symptoms for the first week or so. In severe cases, they can intensify into pneumonia during the second and, in rarer cases, the infection will turn unexpectedly deadly.  At the World Health Organisation, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward warns when danger strikes, it's often fast-moving. Doctors report patients can go downhill quickly during those ""critical"" second and third weeks and urge people with or suspected to have the virus to monitor their symptoms, particularly their breathing and fever. Infectious diseases physician Sanjaya Senanayake says he's seen patients develop ""bad shortness of breath"" around the second week of symptoms. ""Then if they're going to get very sick, about two and a half days later, they [usually] start to develop fluid in their lungs."" CT scans from a 77-year-old man with COVID-19 in China over 10 days, showing ground-glass opacity of the lungs and lesions. 
The man died 10 days after the final scan.Credit:The Lancet medical journal  On scans, they call it ground glass – a white mist over the usual empty black of the lungs. In some cases, there are bright spots, eerily similar to the “honeycomb-shaped” lesions left by SARS, but mostly COVID-19 makes a finer and more-even pattern across both lungs. This inflammation is a sign the body is fighting back against the virus – in that battle, the lungs are ground zero. But Professor Collignon warns sometimes the collateral damage can be worse than the bug itself. As the immune system ramps up its defences, blood vessels start to leak and the lungs can be flooded with cellular debris, making it harder for them to pump oxygen to the rest of the body – and harder for patients to draw breath. ""They start to drown,"" Professor Collignon says. Falling blood oxygen levels put pressure on other organs, in particular the heart. More systems can start to fail, and blood pressure too, which, if it falls low enough can tip the body into septic shock, a whole-body infection. ""Even if the virus spreads to the heart or the kidneys and damages them, the real cause of death is still probably going to be oxygen levels falling and setting everything else off,"" Professor Collignon says. ""If you're an older person or already unwell and those organs are weaker, it can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."" While there is a theory that people with already compromised immune systems might escape this effect and so cope with an infection better than expected, Professor Collignon warns they are especially vulnerable to the other big killer – co-infection. Usually being hit with two bugs at once is rare, though not impossible. But as the virus chews through cells, it leaves the lungs less able to filter out germs picked up from the nose and throat – and wide open to a case of the flu or even a bout of bacterial pneumonia. (The first man to die from COVID-19 in Thailand was also sick with dengue fever.) During the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, most victims died not from the original virus but due to these second-wave bacterial pneumonia infections. Fortunately medicine has advanced a lot since then, making such complications much easier to treat. So far, the WHO reports about 20 per cent of cases become severe, requiring medical intervention for serious breathing difficulties and falling blood oxygen levels. Of those, 6 per cent have been pushed into critical care – as multiple organs begin to fail alongside the lungs or septic shock sets in. About 3.4 per cent have died. But experts expect the real death rate is actually much lower, given so many mild cases will likely go undiagnosed. While anyone can catch the virus, older people and those with other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are most at risk of fatal complications. (""Over the age of 50, the immune system starts to fall apart,"" Professor MacIntyre explains). But in Italy, where the virus has gained a particularly deadly foothold, doctors warn that younger patients (in their 30s, 40s and 50s) were also presenting to overwhelmed emergency departments needing help to breathe. Some have even raised the prospect of an age limit for intensive care to free up beds for younger cases as life-saving machines such as ventilators become worth their weight in gold. Data since complied from elsewhere in Europe and North America also reflects a concerning number of hospitalisations among people under 55, prompting warnings for younger adults to take COVID-19 more seriously. As of April 6, 448 of Australia's then 5795 cases were in hospital, 96 of them in intensive care. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said many of those people were young - in their 30s. ""This is not just an old person's disease,"" he said. ""Those young people don't have [other] risk factors."" While so far those who have died in Australia have been over 50, people in their 20s have seen the highest number of coronavirus infections of any age bracket. So far internationally very few children have been diagnosed or suffered serious cases globally – a phenomenon also observed during SARS. Still, they are not immune and some have died from the illness, including the heart-breaking case of a six-week old baby in the US. Smokers are considered more at risk, as early studies show the same cell receptors the virus hijacks in the lungs increase with cigarette smoke. But pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers so far do not appear in any heightened danger, as they were during the last pandemic, the 2009 swine flu. Still they should take precautions as they are known to be more susceptible to other common respiratory viruses. Whatever your personal vulnerability, the dose of virus you first receive – say, from touching a contaminated door knob versus caring for an infected person over several days – also plays a big part in how your body copes. ""The higher the dose the faster you will get sick, and the harder it will be on you,"" Professor MacIntyre says. That could explain why otherwise young and healthy medical workers have died from the disease. Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old doctor who blew the whistle on early cases of COVID-19, went through a gamut of treatments after falling ill himself, including antivirals, antibiotics, even having his blood pumped through an artificial lung, but he died weeks later. As with SARS, clusters of severe infection are emerging in hospitals and households as people come into sustained close contact. Despite the breakneck speed of global research, a vaccine for COVID-19 is still many months away. And, while antivirals and therapies that block diseases such as malaria, Ebola and HIV are being trialled against the new disease in some parts of the world, including Australia, treatment is largely about managing complications – providing oxygen, keeping up fluids and monitoring how the body is coping. Antibiotics don't work on the virus as it is not caused by bacteria but they can be deployed against secondary infections. If breathing starts to fall, respirators and other measures will kick in to keep the lungs going. As Professor Lewin explains, doctors have a key choice when treating any new virus: is it better to block it directly with antiviral therapies as in the case of HIV or should they also dampen down the body's immune response using drugs such as Interferon, to minimise the fall-out damage? ""Sometimes that can help but sometimes it means the infection overwhelms,"" Professor Lewin says. ""It didn't work with SARS but there's been some success with MERS. Already for this, there's been candidate [therapies] that look good in test tubes, but we need trials. China has about 70 going, testing different [approaches] but they're actually struggling to enrol people now as cases fall."" No vaccine exists for either SARS or MERS - the former died out within about nine months so an inoculation never hit the market while the less common MERS has struggled to attract research funding since it emerged in 2012. After the big Ebola outbreak of 2014, a global group formed to speed up research into vaccines and MERS was recently identified as a priority. ""Then this new one hit,"" Professor Lewin says. Professor Collignon thinks it unlikely any of the potential treatments now being tested against COVID-19 will save the day before a vaccine hits the market – without larger trials, he warns, small studies can miss big problems on roll-out. Experts also warn of increased pressure on hospitals  if severe coronavirus cases hit wards all at once. While Australia's healthcare system is strong compared to other countries, it's population is also older, Professor MacIntyre notes, meaning more demand for intensive care. To slow down the virus and avoid a ""pinch"" around flu season, Australia has followed other countries in rolling out stricter containment measures such as quarantining suspected cases, shutting down gatherings and ordering people to stay home except for essential reasons. So far it appears to be working - a surge in new infections in mid-March has now begun to flatten. Most people with COVID-19 present to hospital because they're having trouble breathing, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. Once admitted and getting oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but others will need ventilators or other machines to keep their lungs and organs working. Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a breathing machine known as a ventilator, whether they know it or not. But Dr Suzi Nou at the Australian Society of Anaesthetists says that while a patient having routine surgery will need a ventilator for minutes or hours – perhaps a few days in intensive care – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. Australia is already doubling the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to 4000 - some are being freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery. But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou. It's those doctors and nurses who will need help to keep coming to work in the weeks and months ahead, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Retired healthcare workers as well as medical students are now being drafted into the fight. Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” Replay   Professor MacIntyre says it's too early to say if this disease will result in any permanent damage for severe cases– such as the lung tissue scarring seen in some SARS and MERS patients. But a full recovery typically takes about 10 days to a month. Symptoms tend to clear up within a fortnight in mild cases or six weeks for more serious, Associate Professor Senanayake says.  Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. So far, more than 300,000 people have already recovered worldwide. With these virus-fighting antibodies in their system, many experts expect they will remain immune for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Recovering from a virus usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. For COVID-19, there have already been cases of people cleared of the virus, only to test positive again days later or, in the case of one woman, more than a month down the line. But while experts say it's possible to be re-infected again, it's more likely the virus was still in their system. Some studies have even suggested it can lie dormant in other parts of the body for weeks - with the longest period of infectiousness recorded as 37 days so far. ""But in some cases, when people are returning persistently positive tests after getting better, they might be finding dead virus,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. Amid a shortage of testing kits world-wide, Australia is only retesting frontline staff in health and aged care to confirm their recovery. That means official recovery data remains patchy. Most patients are instead told to wait 72 hours after symptoms disappear (provided they have already isolated for 10 days from illness onset). A federal government spokesman also said a patient who keeps testing positive after symptoms vanish is not necessarily still infectious. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve,"" he said. Back in Wuhan, Reed was cleared to leave his own home quarantine months ago but, like tens of millions of people in China, he'd spent the first three months of 2020 under lockdown in an unprecedented government effort to stem the virus's spread. On April 8, the streets finally opened again - residents waved flags and sang songs as they left their homes for the first time in 11 weeks. While the local government did not appear to pick up early cases of the virus, Reed says China took the right step, however extreme, in shutting down parts of the country - the government's data says new infections have all but stopped within its borders, even as new frontiers of the virus rage in the US and Europe. ""In Italy, it seems to be a similar thing to Wuhan,"" Reed says. ""The virus was there, but people didn't notice, it was brewing quietly for a while, and then it suddenly exploded. Now they've followed China with lockdowns. Australians need to take this seriously."" Reed was born in the UK but is now hoping to return to Brisbane, where he grew up and his family still live. ""I'm likely immune now, I feel fine, but I know I've gotten very lucky.

6,/national/since-you-asked-your-covid-19-questions-answered-20200323-p54cy7.html,Can you catch the virus from your pets? What about central heating? Your COVID-19 questions answered,"Since it emerged in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million people and claimed 94,000 lives. To stop a pandemic that spreads from person to person in close quarters, the world has largely shut down, with borders closed, streets empty and whole cities going into quarantine. Australia has its own strict measures to avoid the terrible scenes playing out in places such as Italy and the United States, where hospital systems are now being overwhelmed. We are told to live our lives further apart – literally – by avoiding gatherings, staying home and keeping 1.5 metres clear of each other.  As we learn more about this virus, questions from you, our readers, are flooding in. Our explainer team, as well as our health, science and data reporters, will answer as many of them as we can. And when new information comes to light, we'll bring you updates too – with the latest featured up top in this story. Here's what we know so far. There's no evidence cats can infect people. Credit:The Age It appears that, as with the first dangerous coronavirus to emerge in humans, SARS, it's possible for our pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about an asymptomatic Pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a ""weak positive"" test for COVID-19 (and a tiger also catching a mild dose, from a keeper, at the Bronx Zoo in New York), the World Health Organisation stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people, and no one should abandon their animals. Hong Kong authorities tested 17 dogs and eight cats from households with confirmed COVID-19 cases or people in close contact with confirmed patients and found two dogs that tested positive – the Pomeranian and a German Shepherd – but they did not appear to show symptoms. They concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings, although they could test positive if exposed by their owners. If it were possible to catch coronavirus from your pet, two veterinary experts looking into the US tiger case told The New York Times, it would have already become a clear factor in this pandemic, given the huge numbers of cases, and other scientists have since echoed the sentiment: there hasn’t been a single case. While the virus is thought to have jumped from wild animals into humans and mutated, that was one “spillover” event, likely at a wet market where wildlife were caged and killed in close contact with people, and there is no evidence of another species jump. One small study that did cause a stir online found that cats and ferrets could be infected and pass on the virus to one another (dogs and farm animals were less susceptible) but it’s important to note the context for the research – animals in the study were deliberately infected with very high doses of the virus to see if a possible vaccine could be tested on them. And researchers did not find they could then give the virus to humans. “We’re not overly concerned about people contracting covid-19 through contact with dogs and cats,” the American Veterinary Medical Association's  chief veterinary officer Gail Golab has told the Washington Post, adding “the virus survives best on smooth surfaces, such as countertops and doorknobs. Porous materials, such as pet fur, tend to absorb and trap pathogens, making it harder to contract them through touch.” “The current spread of coronavirus in humans is the result of human-to-human transmission,” said Australian Veterinary Association President Dr Julia Crawford on March 11. “To date, there is no evidence that pets can spread the disease, or that they can become sick.” The WHO is now investigating the case of the tiger – which showed mild symptoms but is said to be recovering well – as well as a possible infection in a cat in Belgium and the two dogs in Hong Kong to understand how pets may get the virus. It’s “important we remain respectful and kind” to any animals co-infected with humans, says Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies program. “They’re victims like the rest of us.” In Australia, the federal government says there have been no cases detected in any domestic animals here (pets or livestock) or wildlife, and the current virus is spreading between people not animals. Testing for the virus in animals requires different testing kits and, while Australia “does have capabilities” to do it, it's not a priority given “the latest scientific information”. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also does not consider there to be evidence of a threat from animals. It instead advises you to “protect pets” if you yourself are sick, limiting contact, but otherwise you should exercise the usual precautions around animals. With pets now revelling in their owners being home with them (and still allowed to walk them and take them to the vet) under strict new social distancing measures, follow commonsense hygiene. “What owners can do is what we always recommend,"" says Dr Crawford. ""Please practise good hygiene, including washing your hands before and after handling your pets, as well as their food.” And don't attempt to disinfect your cat, it could hurt them. While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk from aerosols may have been underestimated. Warning signs are piling up, Professor Morawska says - the virus rips through a cruise ship even after passengers are isolated in their cabins, a choir meets in Washington and 45 out of the 60 singers leave the two hour rehearsal infected even though none have symptoms. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet (which are classed as anything more than five microns in size). They can leave the body as both. It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s, they only travel a metre. But we know more now. “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. Professor Morawska, who heads up the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology,  is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for potential aerosol transmission. On April 9, the Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading far or frequently in the air. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would be likely look different – moving faster and striking down more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results – some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska notes, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. The warmer the conditions, the faster they tend to break up. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours but the WHO has since pointed out that it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus generally aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO itself has issued warnings to healthcare workers that this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 operate as if the infection is airborne, including in Australia.  ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Face masks: recommended in the US but not in Australia.Credit:The Age Face masks can protect against the droplets that spread the virus and are now a common sight on the streets of many cities around the world such as Hong Kong. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put healthcare workers at risk. All the same, calls are growing in many Western countries for a wider take-up of face masks to slow outbreaks. In the US, the CDC has already reversed its own advice, given research showing even people without symptoms can spread the virus. It now urges people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Aerosol scientist Professor Lidia Morawska agrees with the move, saying masks aren't needed outdoors but are a good idea where ventilation is poor. But infectious disease experts Professor Raina MacIntyre and Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say they are not as necessary in Australia as in places such as New York, where community transmission is now rampant. It’s also unclear how much home-made masks or bandannas and scarves will block virus-laden droplets. Some experts warn widespread use of DIY masks could leave people with a false sense of security - and an urge to touch (and so possibly contaminate) their face more often as they adjust them. Australian health authorities have indicated they are reviewing their own advice on masks, as they do all their guidelines, but stress it still stands. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has urged people not to ""waste"" masks and notes they should be handled carefully and changed regularly (Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty recommends sterilising used masks rather than throwing them away, given the shortage). Right now, health authorities say anyone who spends more than two hours in an enclosed room with an infected person has been exposed to the virus. But Professor Morawska warns there needs to be more focus on the need to opt for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. Associate Professor Senanayake says air-conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the Department of Health agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low outside healthcare settings. NSW Health said it considered air-conditioners and heating safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and, if possible, use a different bathroom ... to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets ... and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne."" Yes. Some people will be infected without symptoms or very mild symptoms. To test for COVID-19 right now, clinicians need to either take a direct sample of the virus, from a throat or nose swab or in lung phlegm, and examine its genetic code. Those tests are considered very accurate but in some cases if they miss the virus – say, because it is further down in the lungs and someone doesn’t cough up any phlegm (or sputum) – they can return a false negative. That’s why tests are often repeated, especially for patients recovering and returning to the community. Blood tests, which look for the body’s immune response to the infection, can also be used but are not yet widely available outside China, and bring their own false negative risks – antibodies deployed by the body to fight off the virus can take more than a week to form so may not show up if the test is performed too early into the illness. This is also true of the rapid finger-prick tests being checked in Australia right now by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after problems overseas. A government spokesman said these are therefore not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA sample or PCR test and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. Scientists aren’t sure yet but they think it most likely. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with those aforementioned antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Many experts say reports of people appearing to catch this new virus twice are probably best explained by false negative tests clearing them of the infection too early (when the virus had actually remained in their system) rather than catching it a second time. Associate Professor Senanayake says the virus collected by the later tests may even be dead. Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. Countries that have ""flattened their curve"" and dramatically slowed outbreaks have carried out exhaustive testing and contact tracing. In many cases, people without symptoms are tested and health officials actively hunt for others, checking temperatures on entry to buildings. Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries (more than 300,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still fairly strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. Amid increasing calls from the WHO to ""test all suspected cases"", Australia has since ramped up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expanded that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also started in areas identified as at risk of community transmission, such as Sydney. Some states are taking matters into their own hands. On April 6, the ACT began random sample testing of those with symptoms but no other risk factors as did Queensland in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast. That followed news that Victoria would expand testing to people aged over 65, Indigenous Australians, cruise-ship passengers, people in high-risk settings such as prisons, schools, childcare and homelessness and disability support as well as police and firefighters. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says he supports more widespread testing but stresses there is still a ""temporary"" shortage of testing kits. Faster finger prick tests that tell if someone has antibodies against the virus (and so has it or has fought it off) in their blood are also being checked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. But a government spokesman said these are not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA test because such antibodies can take between five and seven days of infection to develop and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. The spokesman did not give a timeline of Australia's work to fix the testing-kit shortage but said it was ""working with public and private laboratories and with pathology suppliers to understand both international and domestic supply capacity and capability and are exploring the possibility of building further domestic capability to produce tests and reagents for COVID-19"". They also did not answer questions on how kits are being distributed to the states, as some push ahead with their own expanded testing. Australia has one of the lowest positive rates for testing in the world, Professor Murphy says, meaning authorities feel ""reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of cases in Australia and that means we can get on top of cases"" through contact tracing. That's in contrast to countries such as Iran, Italy and even the US, where Australian authorities say they likely only tested the more severe cases or, as Murphy puts it, ""when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in community that were undetected"". Still, at times Australian authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, hundreds of whom later tested positive. But the states have also threatened hefty fines and even jail time for those at risk of spreading the virus who break home quarantine orders. Anyone following the international news on the pandemic will have noticed a marked variation in death rates from Covid-19 among different countries. In hard-hit Italy, for instance, the death rate among confirmed cases is around 12 per cent in the first week of April, compared with 1.75 per cent in Germany and – thus far – less than 1 per cent here. East Asian countries have generally done better, the UK, Spain and the US worse. A number of factors help account for this variation. The most significant is that the death rate will largely reflect how widely you are testing, and the age groups you test in. If, as in Germany, you test a very large number of people, many of whom are young with mild symptoms, you get a lower rate of death overall. If, as in the UK and US, you only test those who are very ill and in hospital, the converse applies: your death rate looks much higher. Per head of population, Australia’s testing regime has been ahead of many other countries. Other factors that contribute to varying death rates include: demographics such as the age profile of a country’s population overall; density of living conditions; patterns of interaction between different generations; cultural factors (such as the absence of social kissing and handshaking in Japan); and, importantly, the capacity of health systems to cope with the very ill. Germany has more than double Italy’s number of acute care beds per 100,000 people, and more than triple the UK’s acute bed capacity. In Italy, with one of the oldest populations in Europe, researchers believe that deeply ingrained habits of adult children living with, or remaining housed close to, their parents has contributed to the high fatality rate there. Younger adults, commuting into larger employment centres where the virus had been silently spreading, bring the virus back to the smaller communities where their parents live. Smoking rates may be a factor in some places. The jury is out on whether seasonality (whether a country is going into warmer or cooler weather) plays a role. – Deborah Snow No matter where you live, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised that there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Here's the boiled-down version texted to thousands of Australians: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care."" Whenever you go out you must stick with just those in your household or up to one other external person, and you should keep your distance from others (about two steps or 1.5 metres). Wash or sanitise your hands regularly and ditch the handshake and the kiss hello. In enforcing these rules, authorities are emphasising a ""common sense"" approach. As NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says: ""If you're questioning whether you should be doing something, best to give it a miss."" We put a list of your questions to governments and are including the answers below, as we get them, and in more detail in this dedicated explainer here. On April 3, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""Doesn't matter what temperature it is, if it's a warm day, don't go in masses down to the beach."" The key word here is masses. No state has outlawed a trip to the beach (or the park) but they are urging people to reconsider whether the visit is necessary and warn new rules against gatherings may be enforced. Queensland police have closed some beaches, discouraged people from travelling long distances to them. Victoria also advises people to ""keep visits short and maintain physical distancing at all times"". A walk or a quick swim is ok, sunbaking probably not.  You can still hop in the car on your way to exercise but all states advise limiting travel. In Victoria, a government spokeswoman said on April 1, you should only drive in cars with people you live with, but advice since released says you can still use taxis and other ride-share services for ""permitted purposes"". WA advises sitting in the back if getting a taxi or an Uber and Tasmania also encourages people to extend physical distancing to car travel. ""Travelling in cars is not restricted ... non-essential travel is,"" a Tasmanian government spokeswoman said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio people should not be going anywhere just for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out of the car. ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Not all states answered questions on whether learner drivers could still go out for driving practice but in Victoria, learner driving lessons should only be part of essential travel, such as to the supermarket.But NSW Police have ruled that learner driver lessons can continue – for an instructor it could be considered work that cannot be done from home and for the learner it is ""akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Family members can also take learners out for a lesson or for other essential travel. See more here. It depends on the circumstances – and again on what state you live in. The question of romantic partners who don't cohabit initially caused particular consternation when NSW and Victoria both ruled out social visits under their new emergency powers. You can still visit someone's house to care for them, drop off supplies or in an emergency – say, if you are fleeing danger, but in Victoria Police Minister Lisa Neville said on March 31 ""you cannot visit your partner for social reasons"". On the morning of April 1, a Victorian health department spokeswoman added: ""You shouldn't be physically intimate with people you're not living with, even if they are your partner."" But, later in the day, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton announced the rules around romantic partners – which by then had become known as the ""bonk ban"" – would be relaxed with a new exemption for couples. In NSW, Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route, clariyfing that you can still visit your partner as it falls under the category of ""care"". ""Mental health, we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you"". Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as Tasmania and the ACT still let you have up to two visitors over to your home at one time as long as you are following social distancing measures – no hugging or kissing, and allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In Queensland,you can have two visitors to each household - but no strangers are allowed over. In all states, child custody arrangements are unaffected and tradesman, cleaners, even removalists are allowed if you really need them (they may fall under essential work or caring) but physical distancing must be maintained. – with Lydia Lynch Unlike child custody, the rules around babysitting are less clear, although it again appears to fall under either care or work in most states. Victoria has since clarified its own rules to allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. But older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia’s chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  - with Noel Towell Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"" as new data shows tough new social distancing measures are slowing down the virus' spread in Australia. All states have issued similiar advice, warning a migration to the coast could spread the virus further and put dangerous strain on regional health resources. But not all are fining people for ducking down to the holiday house. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said police don't have the resources to enforce the advice over the upcoming Easter weekend but stressed ""this is not a holiday weekend, we can't have a normal Easter"" and state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says if you've booked a holiday you should cancel it. Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them as a household. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – shopping; medical care or caregiving; work or education; and exercise – or you can be fined. Camping or setting up a caravan somewhere is out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental either. Airbnb now have cancellation policies in place to get a full refund if you booked before March 14. NSW says people shouldn't go on holidays or use Airbnb unless it's for an essential reason such as work and police have revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. See more here.  In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, “Easter holidays are cancelled this year”. Queensland police have flagged they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. - with Stuart Layt, Tammy Mills, Michael Evans, Hannah Barry, Michael Fowler If you have to. You can even have removalists provided you adhere to physical distancing rules. The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow its infection rate by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing As the world waits for a vaccine, this will save lives by helping stop a surge of cases overwhelming emergency departments all at once. Along with measures such as lockdowns and tracing and isolating cases, social distancing has worked against outbreaks in the past, including the Spanish Flu of 1918. The recent surge in Australian cases has started to slow a little in recent days as new rules come into force. But if people do not follow them, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns that Australia could lose its window to contain the outbreak – and cases could rapidly explode. . The federal government has stopped tracking recovery numbers in Australia, drawing criticism from some experts who say it is an important measure of any outbreak. Amid a shortage of testing kits, an Australian government spokesman confirmed only healthcare and aged care workers returning to the frontline must be ""cleared"" with testing (two negative tests) under the national guidelines. Local health authorities keep a close eye on all confirmed cases on the virus and others may still be retested. But most, such as those recovering in home isolation, only have to meet the following conditions: The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention advises the same 72-hour window of time after symptoms disappear but some studies overseas have shown the virus can live in the body for weeks after. The Australian government spokesman said ""a small proportion of people may have an illness that has completely resolved but their [tests] remain persistently positive"". There a decision on release from isolation will be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting their doctor, the testing lab and the public health unit. The 72-hour rule was decided by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which advises Health Minister Greg Hunt, as ""a precautionary period to manage uncertainty around how long a confirmed case remains infectious post-symptom resolution"", the spokesman said. ""Even in these patients there is uncertainty around whether there is a direct correlation of persistent [positive tests] and infectivity, but what we know from other virus infection, it is not a neat correlation,"" he said. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve."" Wash your hands after holding your cup. ""It's all about interrupting the chance of self-inoculation,"" says Associate Professor Ian Mackay, an expert on coronaviruses, at the University of Queensland. The virus has been found to last for shorter periods on card and paper than some other surfaces but it can persist, according to lab studies. ""Whether there is ever likely to be enough virus on that surface to infect another person remains an unanswered question,"" says Professor Mackay. ""The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus.""    Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science – people may be diagnosed or succumb to the illness further down the line. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the WHO estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV, which also caused global panic when it exploded onto the scene in late 2002, and MERS-CoV, which causes a condition more deadly again known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). On the raw figures so far, more than 1.5 million people have been infected worldwide and at least 94,000 have died. About 353,000 have already ""officially"" recovered. The case of the Diamond Princess outbreak has offered one of the most stable data sets yet from which to make calculations- analysis of deaths and infections there put the overall fatality rate at just below 1 per cent. Data out of China found most people (about 80 per cent) recovered from the new virus on their own, even if they developed pneumonia. But about one in five needed more serious medical intervention (such as ventilation to help them breathe) and, of those, 6 per cent were pushed into critical care – as multiple organs began to fail along with the lungs, or septic shock (whole-body infection) set in. Anyone can catch the virus – but people most at risk of complications are older or have other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, making their bodies may be less able to cope with the extra strain. Smokers are also more likely to develop a nasty infection, as the virus breeds via cell receptors in the lungs known to increase with cigarette smoke. Experts say the higher the dose of virus you are hit with, the faster you will show symptoms and the more dangerous it can be for your immune system to fight off. For example, catching the virus from a doorknob is likely to give you a smaller dose than caring for an infected person without protective clothing such as a mask. For more on how the new virus affects the body and what it feels like to get it, you can read this explainer here. Difficulty breathing is the main reason that people with COVID-19 present to a hospital, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. The virus, which attacks the lungs, can progress quite quickly, worsening beyond shortness of breath. Once admitted to a ward and receiving oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but other people will need increasing amounts of support to keep their lungs sending oxygen throughout their body. ""That’s where intensive care would step in,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “If it’s bad enough that you need to be put on a breathing machine then you would definitely be in intensive care. If there was a sense that a patient was deteriorating towards needing a ventilator or a life-support machine, we’d also put them in intensive care. What intensive care is able to offer is the medical specialists and more monitoring … It's very intense – not surprisingly, given the name.” Without a drug that is definitively proven to halt or even slow COVID-19 at this stage, the aim is to support patients until they recover. “We wait for the virus to clear up and then the lungs will often repair themselves if we can wait and just support them while they do that. So you might have a period of, say, a week on a life-support machine where the virus starts to clear itself and the lungs start to improve and then we take the breathing machine away.” Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down. But, as experience has shown worldwide, the outcome is not always positive. “Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “They’re not using as much oxygen as they would normally. The problem with that is it works quite well and it’s a really effective therapy but, obviously, being in that state puts the body in quite a vulnerable position.” There are two problems that can arise, he says. One is that the infection itself can affect the other organs. And there is “just the stress of being so sick”. “We're supposed to be up and walking around but when you’re in intensive care your body is a little bit vulnerable to either getting another infection from bacteria, or the virus itself affecting your other organs. That’s why there is a difference, unfortunately, that people who are a little bit older or those a bit more vulnerable beforehand don’t do as well as people that are younger.” Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” So what would he say to younger people, including those aged 20-29 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria more than any other age group? “Stay home. Do what the government’s asking us to do. Let’s do that for a week or a few months. You’re doing it potentially to protect yourself – it’s not impossible that young people get sick – but you’re really doing it to protect the older people in our community. To me, it’s a real social responsibility. It’s sort of a good test of Australians' ability to look after each other, really. You know, we all like to think we do that – but this is probably the chance to prove it.” Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a ventilator, whether they know it or not. It happens between the bit where you start to feel drowsy – ”you stop breathing and then I put in a breathing tube and put you on to a breathing machine,” says Dr Suzi Nou, president of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists – and the bit where you wake up in the recovery room. That breathing machine is a ventilator, pushing oxygen into your body. “For healthy patients undergoing routine surgery, [when] I stop giving them anaesthetic, they start breathing for themselves,” says Dr Nou. Treating patients with COVID-19, whose lungs are compromised by the disease, is another story. “They’re too unwell to do the job of breathing for themselves. We’d induce the state of sleepiness, put a breathing tube in and put them on the ventilator.” While a patient having routine surgery will rely on a ventilator for minutes or hours – and it’s not uncommon for a patient in intensive care to rely on one for four or five days – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. This is why ventilators have become such a precious commodity worldwide since the pandemic took hold, prompting a doctor in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy to say they had become as precious as gold. There are plans for the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to be doubled to 4000 while more have been freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and still more are now being manufactured in Australia.   But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou and highly trained nurses. In Australia, every patient on a ventilator has a dedicated nurse. It's these professionals who need to be supported to keep coming to work in the coming weeks and months, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Symptoms tend to clear up in just a week or two in mild cases or three to six for more serious, according to WHO data. But early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer in some cases. Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. Experts say it’s too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients. The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home ""where practicable"", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. If you fall into these categories, this measure is designed to protect you, not keep you a prisoner at home. You can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or even the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have also been restricted to protect vulnerable elderly residents. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says Australians weighing up whether to bring elderly relatives home to care for them now face a difficult ""trade-off"". On the one hand, Professor Kelly says ""the most frail, elderly people requiring, for example, a lot of home care ... may be best to shelter with relatives"". But if other family members are going ""out into the world ... and interacting with others"", they risk bringing the virus into the home. The answer isn't always clear-cut and will come down to personal circumstances. While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show concerningly high hospitalisation rates among the under 60s and in Australia there are people under 50 already in need of intensive care. And note this: there have now been more coronavirus cases in both NSW and Victoria among 25- to 29 year-olds than any other age group. In any case, even if you're young and get a milder case you can still spread the virus to someone who might not be so lucky. Aren't you the optimist? The new rules spell the end of the backyard barbecue or the extended family dinner – at least for now. House parties might even become an offence in some states. But experts say these tough temporary measures reflect just how easily the virus can spread. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has warned of a dinner party where one person was infected with COVID-19 – at the start of the night. ""By the end of the dinner party, almost everybody [there] had the coronavirus – this spreads rapidly,"" he said. Children on school holidays should not have friends over nor hang around shopping centres together, Mr Andrews has said, and it's not a case of moving beers at the pub to the living room. “We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds. That will mean they will die. We’ve got to buy time.” The first NSW COVID-19 cases were reported in Burwood, Parramatta, Randwick and Ku-Ring-Gai in late January. Clusters of cases began appearing in Ryde, Parramatta, Hornsby and central Sydney in mid-March. The virus began to spread outside Sydney on March 5, with early cases in Goulburn, the Mid-Coast and Orange. It has since spread up and down the state's east coast and in regional areas inland. By the end of March, the biggest clusters – in Waverley, the Northern Beaches and Sydney – had more than 100 cases each. More than 100 cases were linked to three cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, which docked at Circular Quay in late March. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the local government area of Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers of cases have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne. A woman infected with COVID-19 on a ski holiday in the US attended a 21st birthday party in wealthy inner-east Malvern, and at least six guests contracted the virus. On April 1, the Stonnington local government area, which encompasses Malvern, had the highest number of confirmed cases with 77. In recent days there have been cases among retail workers, such as a Coles and K-Mart outlet in Melbourne's east. Hospitals have also been the site of smaller clusters and, as it stands at the moment, about 10 per cent of Victoria's confirmed coronavirus diagnoses have been in healthcare workers. Viruses need hosts to survive – they can't make it on their own. So far, the best evidence we have on how long the virus lasts on surfaces comes from a letter to the editor by a team of American scientists published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s top medical journals. The data is still early stage and needs to be interpreted with caution. They placed samples of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper and tracked what happened to the virus. The virus was the most stable on plastic and stainless steel and could be detected up to 72 hours later. On absorbent surfaces such as cardboard, fabric or paper it degrades much faster. However, the amount of the virus fell quickly over time. On plastic, for example, it halved in about seven hours. That indicates these surfaces do not remain infectious forever. The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus. Using a card is “probably lower risk”, write Professor Ian Mackay and Dr Katherine Arden on The Conversation, because you keep the card and don’t have to touch other people. In fact, using ""tap and pay"" is a social distancing practice recommended by the federal government. - with Liam Mannix You can still order in food but authorities say you shouldn't let the courier into your home and, if in an apartment, you should pick up the order outside rather than inviting them through a security door into a communal area. Professor Doherty says that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're ""taking hold of the pizza box"". ""Before you take the food out, wash your hands and then put the pizza box somewhere out of the way,"" Professor Doherty suggests in a webinar for the Australian Academy of Science. “It can certainly survive longer on plastics and steel ... in the SARS epidemic, of course, we saw people wiping down elevator buttons. […] Just open everything, wash your hands before you take the food out of the plastic and maybe transfer it to another plastic bag before you put it in the fridge."" No. The Centre for Food Safety’s guidelines say there is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. Soap or dishwashing liquid should not be used, as they can stay on food and cause sickness. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus, says Arden. You also don’t need to scrub food that you are going to later peel, such as oranges. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. “Think of your hands as the enemy,” write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden. If the virus comes into contact with your hands, and then you touch your nose, mouth or eyes, it can gain entry to your body. You must wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly before eating. - Liam Mannix We don’t need to be worried about the temperature of a wash because we use strong detergents in our washing powders, even when they are cold wash formulations, says virologist Katherine Ardern and coronavirus expert Associate Professor Ian Mackay, both at the University of Queensland. They cite a recent study, which, although not having yet been through a peer review process so not conclusive, provides an early picture of how the virus reacts in certain conditions. In a laboratory, a 30-minute incubation of the virus at 56C or a five-minute incubation at 70C rendered SARS-CoV-2 inactive. In its recommendations for households where someone is ill, or suspected of being ill with COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends laundering items ""using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items"", and drying the items completely. A similar answer applies as with washing machines. Professor Mackay notes that if you are caring for an ill person, you need to be extra vigilant in cleaning their crockery and cutlery to ensure that you limit the risk of family spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this if someone has COVID-19 in your household: ""The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items."" The NSW Health Department advises using common household disinfectant sprays for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is what is known as an “enveloped virus”, which means it is made of a little ball of fat and protein. That makes it relatively easily to kill with standard disinfectants. In Australia, disinfectants are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so if you pick the right one – look for a specific disinfectant, not a cleaner – you can be confident it works. Not all disinfectants are regulated by the same standards. Look for a specific label on the disinfectant that means it kills viruses, such as virucidal or antiviral activity. Importantly, this is different to antibacterial – antibacterial ingredients kill bacteria, not viruses. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label, which may include cleaning a surface before disinfecting it. Cleaning and disinfecting are different things. As the CDC notes, cleaning does not kill germs in itself but, by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. The Australian Department of Health advises you to target frequently touched surfaces: door handles, bed rails, table tops and light switches. As with all things COVID-19, there is still much we don’t know. The advice above is based on guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guidance from the Australian Department of Health, from the Australian Research Council Training Centre for Food Safety, and expert commentary from Associate Professor Ian Mackay (an expert on coronaviruses) and Katherine Ardern (a virologist), both at the University of Queensland. – Liam Mannix One of the big mysteries of the virus is how infectious asymptomatic people really are. Some experts say people shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, and the WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours before symptoms first appear. But other studies have tracked infections in parts of China and Singapore to “stealth” transmitters with mild or no symptoms. This also played out in the case of the cruise ship turned floating quarantine site the Diamond Princess in early February. A study found that 18 per cent of those infected on board never showed symptoms. Because this virus can spread before symptoms appear, it is especially hard to contain. ""Let's stop saying it's a bad flu,"" pleaded doctor Daniele Macchini, from the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where the virus had gained a deadly foothold. Patients inundating intensive care wards had ""far from the complications of a flu"", the doctor wrote on Facebook in March. While flu has many of the same symptoms and results in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier. In Australia, government figures for the most recent flu season ending October 2019 show 812 people died of influenza out of 298,120 reported cases – a fatality rate of about 0.27 per cent. Emerging coronaviruses such as this strain and SARS can also do more damage to the body, particularly the lungs. And the new virus is more infectious than the flu, or SARS or MERS, with one COVID-19 patient likely to infect between two and three others. Yes, it's possible. As it breeds in the lungs, the virus can impair your body's ability to filter out germs falling down from the upper airways and so leave some people susceptible to another bug – whether the common cold, influenza or a case of bacterial pneumonia. So this year there is a particular urgency behind calls for people to have their flu shots, as hospitals brace for a surge of COVID-19 and flu cases hitting all at once. On April 1, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly urged Australians, especially those aged over 65, to get their flu vaccines as soon as possible. ""As of now there are millions of vaccines out there ready,"" Professor Kelly said. That's the big question. This virus's closest relative, SARS, while deadly, spread more slowly and to far fewer countries and so early containment efforts worked to wipe it out, largely within a year. For COVID-19, many experts are instead drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available – between 12 and 18 months. The virus has now reached most of the world – more than 170 countries, and the World Health Organisation warns it is ""accelerating"". It took the virus 67 days to infect the first 100,000 people, just 11 to reach 200,000 and four to top 300,000. By mid-March in Australia, the number of cases was doubling every three to four days. In recent days, since stricter social distancing rules came into force and more people start to stay home, that growth has slowed but authorities say now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"". Outside China, major clusters of the virus have broken out in Italy, where hospitals have been pushed to the brink as well as the US, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea. Some nations, including many in Europe, have turned to the ""China model"" of forced home quarantines and transport shutdowns to stop the virus. But experts note that China, as well as countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, have also started to ""flatten their curve"" of infection growth through exhaustive testing, contact tracing of known cases and community take-up of ""social distancing"" measures such as working from home or taking schools online. China's success so far means it is already starting to relax many of its lockdowns, even as it braces for a potential second wave. In Italy and now other countries such as Spain, France and the UK, people are only allowed to leave their homes to run essential errands such as grabbing groceries (and they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Anyone caught breaking Singapore's rules can land themselves in prison after the city-state made it an offence for a person to intentionally stand close to another. The main symptoms of the new coronavirus are: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat. Nausea or diarrhea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS, and a blocked nose is less common again. The federal government has ruled people shouldn’t gather together except for “essential” activities such as school, public transport and work – but working from home is strongly encouraged and schools will move to mostly online lessons after Easter, except for students who have to attend in person. Shopping centres will stay open but food courts will be for takeaway only. People are urged to just buy what they need and not collect together or take time browsing. Those indoor gatherings still running should allow space for one person per four square metres. While the government is yet to move towards a full-scale shutdown of all but non-essential services, the following have already closed or suspended: The good news is the other thing shutting down is evictions – with a moratorium on evictions from commercial and residential rental properties as a “result of financial distress"" for the next six months. Services so far considered ""essential"" under a wider shutdown include pharmacies, fuel stations, health care, food shops and public transport and airports. Hairdressers and barbers are not on that list but can remain open for now – though they must strictly manage social distancing and the four-square-metre rule. The federal government says hotels, hostels, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be a decision for each state and territory. All non-urgent elective surgeries are postponed until further notice. Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has written to states and territories urging them to exempt telcos, postal services and media organisations from any future restrictions on movement as ""essential services"". Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses – and funerals must be capped at 10 people, in what the government has called ""very difficult"" but necessary measures. JobSeeker is a payment of $550 a fortnight (now increased to $1100 a fortnight as part of a coronavirus stimulus boost) for those who have lost their employment. JobSeeker replaced the NewStart allowance in March. However, the new JobKeeper scheme is a $1500 payment (before tax) per staff member provided to employers by the government over the next six months to help businesses hold onto workers so that after the pandemic is over they can more easily start over. Employers can only receive the subsidy if they have turnover of less than $1 billion and this figure has fallen by 30 per cent or more, or they have a turnover higher than $1 billion and this has fallen by 50 per cent or more. Employers receiving the subsidy must report to the Australian Tax Office every month. See here for details. – Jennifer Duke At least one in 10 Australians have asthma but the condition doesn’t mean you’re more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack. “It’s a double-whammy, really,” says National Asthma Council Australia chief Siobhan Brophy. Respiratory physician Peter Wark says there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how COVID-19 affects asthmatics but, from previous experience with other respiratory illnesses, they’ll likely be at higher risk of complications – as was observed during the SARS outbreak and still occurs with common illnesses such as cold and flu. The WHO and other health authorities are urging extra precautions for asthmatics. Brophy says now is the time to be on your “best behaviour”: following your asthma plan and doctor’s advice to the letter and re-filling prescriptions so your lungs are in their best shape possible should an infection come. While people without the condition have been hoarding ventolin, she notes there’s little point as the medication is designed to treat an asthma attack and not COVID-19. There has been some concern about continuing asthma medication such as steroid tablets or injections, which could suppress the body's overall immune system, Brophy says, but steroid inhalers are still fine – they only travel to the lungs and remain vital for asthmatics. “Talk to your doctor before you stop taking anything but if you’re still using an old nebuliser to take your medication, use a puffer and a spacer instead. A nebuliser will spray out particles [and possibly germs] from your lungs."" Tell your doctor about your asthma and your medication if you develop symptoms. Replay   Coronaviruses are a family of viruses causing respiratory illness mostly found in animals. Only seven have been identified in humans, including the four that commonly give us coughs and colds. But when a new strain jumps across from wildlife, such as SARS and now this new strain, it can be dangerous as there is no natural immunity to fight it off. Because it's new, at first the virus was known simply as the ""novel"" coronavirus. Then the WHO named it SARS-CoV-2, given it shares so much of its DNA – about 75 per cent – with the SARS-CoV strain behind the SARS outbreak. The illness caused by this current strain is now called COVID-19. The illness was first identified after people started falling ill at wet market reported to sell wild animals in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unfounded theories that the virus is man-made quickly began to circulate online but scientists studying its genome already agree it came from animals - as more than 70 per cent of all new diseases emerging in humans do. Wild animals packed together and then butchered in live markets throughout Asia can be incubators for viruses to evolve and jump species barriers – SARS was traced back to a colony of bats but was believed to have passed into humans again in a wet market via the Himalayan palm civet, an ancient species of mammal eaten as a delicacy in China. And MERS also has bat origins but mostly spreads from infected camels, often in slaughterhouses. Bats are essential to many ecosystems we rely on but, through a lucky quirk in their immune system, they also carry a whole host of diseases that do not harm them. Early work suggests this new virus is 96 per cent similar to a SARS-like strain already discovered in bats a few years back, but experts think it likely first jumped into another animal, possibly the highly endangered and heavily trafficked pangolin, where it gained potency before passing into humans.  The question of who should practice this social distancing (everyone) versus who should seal themselves off completely has sparked some confusion. To stem the spread of COVID-19, millions of people infected or exposed around the world are also being urged to go into voluntary exile at home or in isolation wards. While some people have chosen to start home isolation themselves, thousands of others in Australia been already been issued formal notices to comply as states call in police to help enforce them. We dive into the rules in this explainer here but in brief: if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, then you must self-isolate for a full fortnight (the estimated period of virus incubation before symptoms appear). If you are self-isolating at home, your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food rather than going out, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch out for are a high fever and shortness of breath). If you are infected yourself or awaiting tests, then everyone should stay home. You can still wander into your garden or balcony but, while some officials have said you can walk the dog or stretch your legs, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says you must stay home if you've been told to self-isolate: ""Sorry."" Despite these rules, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said, on March 27, that Australia was still seeing large numbers of returned travellers with the virus and, in many cases, passing it on to their families. “More than two-thirds are returned travellers, and a significant proportion of the other cases have been transmitted from returned travellers,” he said. From March 29, all overseas arrivals are being escorted from airports into hotels and other accommodation for the 14-day window, at the government's expense. The army has been called in alongside police to enforce these quarantines after a number of people were caught out of their homes breaking isolation orders. Only if you really have to. Our borders have closed and overseas travel is now banned under biosecurity powers, except in exceptional circumstances. Citizens still travelling abroad are urged to come home as countries impose similar shutdowns of their own. Starting with Tasmania, most states have also started to close their domestic borders - police patrols will now ask people crossing over to go into quarantine for the recommended 14-day window. At this early stage, we are still not absolutely sure how the virus affects women and babies. Different governments have offered different advice.For now, let’s stick to what Australia’s peak body, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZOG), has to say. Note these guidelines are changing regularly and you should check back on their website for the most up-to-date advice. According to guidelines, at this stage it does not appear that pregnant women are at greater risk from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - like they were during the world's last pandemic Swine Flu in 2009. However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. There is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or birth abnormalities, nor is there evidence the virus can pass from woman to unborn child or via breastmilk. “The safest place to birth your baby is in a hospital, where you have access to highly trained staff and emergency facilities,” the guidelines state. If the mother is infected at the time of birth, she should not be separated from her newborn, but should wear a mask and take precautions. The health advice is the same for pregnant women as it is for everyone else: work from home, avoid public places, and nail your hand hygiene. The RANZCOG guidelines suggest visitors in hospital are limited only to the immediate partner. But this is just a suggestion – different hospitals will have different rules. No. Public transport is still running as it is considered one of the essential activities exempt from the government's ban on gatherings but cleaning has been ramped up. While calls are growing from some experts to shut down public transport already, many people rely on it. Still, as social distancing rules come into force, travellers are deserting normally packed routes in droves. When on public transport, health officials say you should allow room for others as much as possible, rather than crowding in. It's also important to keep an eye on what you've been touching. If you then touch your face, a virus surviving on, say, a metal handrail could jump across – so carry a disinfectant or even wear one (stylish) glove for holding on and touching things. The most hopeful estimates fall within the range of 12 to 18 months. A report for the British government put it at “potentially 18 months or more”. Why? Because making a vaccine is really, really hard. To make a vaccine, you first need to design a way of giving a human immunity against a virus. Then you need to make sure the vaccine is not toxic. Then you need to test it in animals. Then you need to test it in humans – and the tests need to be large so we can make sure it works and is safe. And then you need to make the billions of doses needed. And there is every chance a vaccine that looks promising in the lab, or in animal tests, won’t work in humans. Experts are hoping to roll out a safe vaccine within 18 months. But even that would be unprecedented. No vaccine has ever been developed that quickly. - Liam Mannix, science reporter The Peter Doherty Institute in Australia is working on both a vaccine and a potential therapeutic treatment for the virus, and director Sharon Lewin says the latter might offer a faster fix. A drug that could block the virus from replicating in the body (or calm down the body's intense immune response to it) could keep patients with severe infections alive and, in the case of an antiviral, reduce transmission. Several existing drugs are now being trialled against the new virus worldwide, including those used to treat HIV, malaria, and arthritis. The results look promising but it's not time to rush out to the pharmacy just yet. It took this new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first thousand people. By contrast, SARS took 130 days and the less infectious MERS more than two years to infect a thousand people after it emerged in 2012. When SARS finished its spread after nine months in 2003, only 8098 cases had been confirmed across 26 countries but close to 10 per cent of those were fatal. (Most clusters happened in hospitals or households.) MERS has been circulating for eight years across 27 countries so far, and kills about a third of those who fall ill – out of about 2500 confirmed cases. Ebola is even more deadly, killing more than 40 per cent of those diagnosed over a number of outbreaks since the 1970s but it has been reported in just a handful of countries. In the pandemic records, the infamous 1918 Spanish flu killed about 2.5 per cent of its victims over two years – but because it infected so many people (close to 27 per cent of the world's population) at a time of much cruder medical care, about 50 million died. Today, doctors are much better able to stave off secondary bacterial infections, which proved particularly deadly during that outbreak. And, unlike the Spanish flu, young people are not dying at the same high rates. The last pandemic was swine flu in 2009, the second coming of a H1N1 influenza that infected between 11 and 21 per cent of the world's population. Governments mounted costly responses until it was ruled to be over in October 2010. But the virus killed about 285,000 people (fewer than seasonal flu normally does) with a relatively low fatality rate of .02 per cent, and the WHO copped criticism for labelling it a pandemic at all.

And, in a bid to stop companies cutting jobs, employees of eligible businesses can claim a new $1500 fortnightly 'Jobkeeper' payment, even some who have already been let go so long as they were with the company on March 1. Businesses and not-for-profits that have experienced more than a 30 per cent downturn in revenue are eligible and payments will be delivered in May but backdated to March. The federal government estimates about half of the workforce - or six million people - will get this payment over the next six months.

7,/world/north-america/this-is-how-america-s-coronavirus-response-went-wrong-20200409-p54ii6.html,This is how America's coronavirus response went wrong,"Washington: The view that the United States is an exceptional nation has long been central to the country's self-image. Ronald Reagan famously described America as ""a shining city upon a hill"". Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's secretary of state, called it ""the indispensable nation"". Replay   ""To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation,"" former Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee said in 2009. But the belief in American exceptionalism has taken a battering in recent years. The Iraq War, the global financial crisis, regular mass shootings, entrenched poverty and the rise of China have shaken the country's sense of superiority. When it came to combating COVID-19, however, there were still good reasons to believe America would stand above the rest of the world. The country is home to many of the world's leading medical experts, pharmaceutical companies and public health institutions. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index - a detailed study published by Johns Hopkins University and the Nuclear Threat Initiative - judged the US better placed than any other nation to respond to a pandemic or epidemic. But that's not how things have turned out. The Trump administration moved quickly to restrict arrivals from China, but did little to prevent the spread of the virus domestically. Donald Trump spent weeks downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus as it was spreading through the US.Credit:Bloomberg The virus is now killing almost 2000 Americans each day - more than anywhere else in the world. Almost 16,000 people have died in the US after contracting the virus, putting it second only to Italy. Rather than affirming American exceptionalism, the pandemic has fed into a narrative of American decline. ""Long before COVID-19 ravaged the earth, there had already been a precipitous decline in the appeal of the American model,"" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. ""The federal government’s slow, incoherent, and all too often ineffective response to the pandemic will reinforce the already widespread view that the United States has lost its way."" On January 30, Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's top trade adviser, wrote a memo warning that the coronavirus could create a pandemic. In late February, he wrote a second memo saying the virus could kill up to 2 million Americans. On the day Navarro sent his first memo, Trump was assuring Americans that everything would be fine. ""We think we have it very well under control,"" the President said. A few days later Trump said the number of cases in the US would soon be ""down to zero"". As late as March 6, he was favourably comparing the coronavirus to the regular flu. Trump's relaxed rhetoric set the tone for Republican politicians and prominent media figures. It was not until March 17 that the President publicly grasped the seriousness of the virus, describing it as a highly contagious ""invisible enemy"" and announcing tough social distancing guidelines. At the state and local level, some leaders have been more proactive than others. San Francisco implemented a stay-at-home order on March 16. Despite being the country's second most densely-populated city, it has only recorded 10 deaths from the virus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo didn't issue a similar order until a week later. The virus was already running rampant in his state, but that was only beginning to become clear. The signature failure of the US response to the coronavirus was the slow rollout of mass testing. Because of technical glitches and bureaucratic bungling, the US was flying blind as the virus spread through the country in February and early March. Instead of using a test developed by the World Health Organisation, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opted to develop its own test. This wasn't particularly unusual. It’s common for nations with strong scientific expertise to develop their own diagnostics. The CDC was indeed able to quickly develop a viable coronavirus test, but struggled to ramp up production. When it started sending out test kits to public health laboratories in early February, problems emerged immediately. Trial runs produced inconclusive results in more than half the labs, meaning the tests couldn’t be relied upon. The CDC implemented a workaround solution, which required the labs to send tests back to the organisation's headquarters in Atlanta. This resulted in days-long delays. By mid-February, the nation was testing only about 100 samples per day. Top researchers at prestigious universities were also hindered in their efforts to roll out their own COVID-19 tests. On January 31 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. It was an important declaration but had unintended consequences. Hospitals and private laboratories that usually face minimal federal regulation were now subject to new rules that required them to obtain permission from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) before using their own tests. It wasn't until late February that the FDA relaxed its rules and allowed certain laboratories to develop and use their own tests before authorisation. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right, helped make the case for a longer shutdown to US President Donald Trump.Credit:Bloomberg The testing failures in the US can be vividly seen by comparing it to South Korea. Both countries recorded their first case of COVID-19 on January 20. By the middle of March, South Korea had conducted 290,000 coronavirus tests. At that time the US had only performed an estimated 60,000. The difference is even more damning when you take into account that the US population is seven times larger than South Korea's. Asked about the testing shortage at a congressional hearing in March, Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said: ""It is a failing, let's admit it."" The pace of testing has increased dramatically over recent weeks. Around 100,000 people are now being tested each day. But the surge came too late to identify emerging hotspots such as New York. For frontline health workers in the US, the biggest concern during the pandemic has been the dire lack of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Hospital staff have held protests outside hospitals pleading for more protective gear. In New York, Broadway costume designers have been sewing masks to donate to hospital workers. Some nurses have been wearing bin bags over their scrubs, while doctors have resorted to wearing ski goggles. Skiers and snowboarders are asked to donate goggles for medical use outside a ski shop in Vermont. Credit:GogglesForDocs Countries around the world have struggled to secure medical supplies, but in the US the problem has been exacerbated by government failures. Trump was slow to invoke the Defence Production Act, a law that allows him to order private companies to manufacture supplies necessary for a national emergency. An official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the ventilator supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. And the lack of planning and co-ordination from the federal government has forced states to compete for vital supplies. This has driven up prices and led to what has been dubbed a ""Wild West"" environment for procurement. The Chicago Sun-Times reported on the remarkable example of officials in Illinois who tracked down a supply of 1.5 million N95 respirator masks in China through a middleman. One day before they expected to complete the purchase, the officials got a call from the supplier saying he had to get a cheque to the bank by 2pm that day or the deal was cancelled. In order to meet the deadline, an official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. Republican and Democratic politicians, who agree on little else, believe the pandemic has exposed America's over-reliance on foreign manufacturers for essential medical supplies. The US now imports half of its personal protective equipment from China and the figure for many vital pharmaceuticals is even higher. 'Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures.' Chinese pharmaceutical companies supply an estimated 90 per cent of US antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone. ""Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures,"" Navarro said last week. He has been pushing Trump to force government agencies to procure all of their medical supplies from US manufacturers. Last month Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill that, if passed, will direct the Department of Defence to determine whether America's reliance on China for pharmaceuticals is a national security concern. A patient is transferred to a waiting ambulance in New York. Credit:AP Last week the White House projected that between 100,000 to 240,000 people could die from the virus in the US - a figure that stunned Americans. They received some welcome news this week when the main model used by the White House showed a big reduction in projected deaths. The model now forecasts that 60,415 people will die by August. ""We know now for sure that the mitigation that we have been doing is having a positive effect,"" Fauci said. Replay   That news sat alongside grim updates from New York, which recorded its biggest single-day death toll of 799 on Thursday (Friday AEST). The state has now lost more than 7000 people to the virus, compared to 2723 in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.

Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in ICU in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state had seen a ""very modest"" increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was ""fantastic"" the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday.

Avid league fans believe this, even if they have to spend their lives defending it. League’s most influential players are not the brawny monsters; they just add volume. The magic of the game is generated by the IQ of its visionaries. From Bob Fulton to Wally Lewis to Andrew Johns to Johnathan Thurston to Cameron Smith, it is the league brain that creates those patterns and passages of play that set your cerebral cortex alight. Your sceptical friends don’t think you’re serious. But you are serious. Compared with many other sports, league is a code for thinkers. Replay   League has been governed and interpreted by smart people. John Quayle, David Gallop, plenty of board members and executives down the years: ignore the occasional boofhead, look at the majority of smart cookies. Most league coaches and many of their assistants are super-intelligent individuals. Commentators? League lovers have been privileged to grow up on Roy Masters and Phil Gould, to appreciate the uncanny analysis of a Peter Sterling or a Johns: maybe not brain surgeons or vaccine developers, but all part of a fabric of a collective football brain. Tom Keneally adores rugby league. Say no more. After the events of the last month, you might wonder if all this ‘intelligent game’ stuff is just a fantasy you’ve invented to convince yourself you haven’t wasted your time. Smart people usually have some awareness of the world around them. On a day when 2000 Americans died and 32,000 tested positive for the disease that killed them, on a day when the official number of global cases passed 1.5 million – leaving out untold unrecorded numbers in the developing world – rugby league announced it was starting again in seven weeks. Woo-hoo! On a day when the sacrifices Australians are making continued to pile up exponentially, the NRL declared that its own game-day sacrifices are coming to an end. Let’s get this party started! All on its own, league is creating a coronavirus-free world. Each day, you hope to discover that rugby league is not actually like this, that it still has the brain you thought it had. Your hopes are raised when you see headlines of stories warning the NRL not to ‘trash its brand’ or ‘act irresponsibly’, but it turns out that its only concern is that the competition has an equitable number of rounds or that the measures to control a viral outbreak among players and staff can be controlled. About the real issue, there is no discussion.

Thinking truly outside the box – say, asking whether rugby league has a greater duty to the community than getting its income streams flowing again, or asking whether it is humanly decent to place sport on such a pedestal to its own self-regard – is too far outside. It’s not a box, it’s a hall of mirrors. And then you look to the outside world to speak truth to league. Governments and health authorities are entering a particularly difficult time. They seem to have done a good job containing the virus, but this only taxes people’s patience more. Unrest is growing every day. The corona-sceptics are on the march. It was all exaggerated. People are getting restless and need persuasion, more than ever, to work together. But here’s rugby league, putting out a big noise: we can loosen up now! Is anyone going to control them? Up steps John Barilaro, the leader of the NSW National Party, informing us that rugby league is ‘the tonic we need’ to get us through the virus. And you thought the tonic was drinking hot water and swallowing malaria pills. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. So here comes rugby league, afloat in its bubble, engorged with its self-importance, looking after its own, breaking ranks with Australia and the world. When families can’t see each other for Easter, rugby league is celebrating the Easter miracle of once again making itself the news. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. But what also appeals, from a lifetime of enjoying league, is its decency. After encountering league people over the years, you almost invariably come away with the feeling that you have met someone fundamentally decent. In fact, this decency sets league apart from so many other sports. League people are the salt of the earth. You know that that has to be a fantasy as well, but it’s your personal experience. Compared to other sports, league is replete with genuine, straight-talking, likeable humans. Not people who’ve got their heads so far up their fundaments that they don’t see, much less respect, what is going on in the world outside their bubble. So, while you, the league fan, are fighting with your son to convince him why he can’t go and visit his girlfriend, league is back on. While you can’t celebrate your elderly widowed mother’s birthday with her, league is on. While you go outside in this horrible Australia where police question you for being outdoors and people stink-eye other people for stopping and talking to each other, league is on. While another million people catch a disease and tens of thousands die, league is back on. But you know what? When the NRL starts again, on May 28 or whenever, you will have wrestled with your conscience over whether it is the right thing to sit down and watch this renegade sport, this pariah code, this arena of self-absorption. By then it will have all worn you down. You will give in, because you just want to feel good again, and league will make you feel good. Like a dumb animal, you’ll go towards the thing you can’t help loving, and you’ll celebrate it, because by then, who knows, you might desperately need something to celebrate. League will give you what you need, by giving itself what it needs. You will watch it. And this is when you realise you were kidding yourself all along, you were the simple fool; and you will give up trying to convince your friends that you love league because it is an intelligent and decent game.

Avid league fans believe this, even if they have to spend their lives defending it. League’s most influential players are not the brawny monsters; they just add volume. The magic of the game is generated by the IQ of its visionaries. From Bob Fulton to Wally Lewis to Andrew Johns to Johnathan Thurston to Cameron Smith, it is the league brain that creates those patterns and passages of play that set your cerebral cortex alight. Your sceptical friends don’t think you’re serious. But you are serious. Compared with many other sports, league is a code for thinkers. Replay   League has been governed and interpreted by smart people. John Quayle, David Gallop, plenty of board members and executives down the years: ignore the occasional boofhead, look at the majority of smart cookies. Most league coaches and many of their assistants are super-intelligent individuals. Commentators? League lovers have been privileged to grow up on Roy Masters and Phil Gould, to appreciate the uncanny analysis of a Peter Sterling or a Johns: maybe not brain surgeons or vaccine developers, but all part of a fabric of a collective football brain. Tom Keneally adores rugby league. Say no more. After the events of the last month, you might wonder if all this ‘intelligent game’ stuff is just a fantasy you’ve invented to convince yourself you haven’t wasted your time. Smart people usually have some awareness of the world around them. On a day when 2000 Americans died and 32,000 tested positive for the disease that killed them, on a day when the official number of global cases passed 1.5 million – leaving out untold unrecorded numbers in the developing world – rugby league announced it was starting again in seven weeks.

Profiteering, finger pointing and fear. The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the worst in some. But look a little deeper and a far more potent story is unfolding: one of kindness, connection and trust. By Konrad Marshall Taking it to the streets … chamber musician Josephine Vains plays a social distancing “concert” for her neighbourhood in Melbourne’s Brunswick.Credit:Chris Hopkins It’s the end of the last Sunday in March, and after dipping low in the vanilla autumn sky, the sun throws all its light on MacFarland Street. A yellow glow kisses this little road in Brunswick, in Melbourne’s inner north. It dances on the puddles left by an afternoon storm. Catches the buzzing mozzies. Hits old chimneys, and iron lace balustrades, and aluminium roofs. And one musical instrument. The latter is an antique cello, made in 1830 of flamed maple and spruce, by a master craftsman from London. And it is embraced by its owner, Josephine Vains, who sits on a chair between two paperbark trees – near her parsley patch and her passionfruit creeper and her yellow recycling bin – on the footpath in front of her cream brick home. Musician Josephine Vains: “This is my way of feeling like I’m continuing to do what I always do. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.""Credit:Chris Hopkins Vains, 45, is a chamber musician who has played with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and taught at the Victorian College of the Arts. She has performed in European cathedrals of gothic splendour. Modern recital centres in the US. The ancient Longyou Caves in China. The bottom of a mine shaft in Macedon in Victoria’s Goldfields region. “Thank you for coming,” she says to her neighbours, around three dozen of whom have, on cue, left self-isolation to come together – while remaining many, many metres apart – for a little concert born on a local WhatsApp group. “I hope you enjoy the show.” They do. They might not recognise the last names of the long-dead composers on the set list, but they recognise beauty in suburbia. As Vains plays Gabrielli, a happy couple sitting on folding chairs – with teardrop wine glasses and a bottle of Margaret River cabernet sauvignon – rise to applaud. As she plays Saint-Saëns, a nuclear family crammed inside their blue Landrover Discovery are rapturous. As she plays the famous prelude from Cello Suite No. 1 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, others clap and grin from their verandahs and driveways, leaning against a front gate, or listening through an open bedroom window. “Beautiful!” yells one man, from a distance. “Thank you!” waves another. “Thanks Josie!” says her next-door neighbour. “That was the first time I’ve heard you,” adds a bloke from around the corner – an interloper from Osborne Street, two blocks down. “And I cried. It was really beautiful.” Vains smiles. All the paid performances on her calendar are cancelled due to COVID-19, but this makes that more bearable. She’s been playing a show at sunset every few days since the last week of March: a handful of songs, for this street and for herself. “This is my way of feeling … like I’m just continuing to do what I always do,” she says afterward. “I feel quite high now. It’s a natural high. And I think they feel that way, too. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.” Do we ever. It’s surreal, this silent, sequestered life we’re leading, this isolation in a coronaviral vacuum. It’s so often quiet and largely numb, yet punctuated by unwelcome sensations, isn’t it? You’ve probably felt one or two. The cold prickle of anxiety. The crack of social dislocation. For me it’s lethargy, sometimes as a sharp strain behind my eyes, but more often like a thick blanket. Every little thing now feels effortful and earnest. Shopping runs are missions during which we stand on crosses of electrical tape, listening to our own trepidatious gulps. Once outside, we can breathe again but heave the odd sad sigh, too, as we wander past shuttered shops. For the most part, we’ve all retreated behind closed doors, into a kind of collective, solitary darkness. Yet it is in this darkness that acts of kindness, and compassion, and levity, and connection – like a concert cellist playing beside a street gutter – stand out best. Some gestures flicker in our eyes like birthday candles. Others light up the night like benevolent flares. Everyone has a favourite pandemic pick-me-up. Perhaps you were touched by that co-ordinated minute of mass applause throughout the UK, as people stood clapping for the exhausted carers within their National Health Service. Or maybe you love the daily appointment Italians have kept, playing music together at dusk, singing Volare from a balcony, or trumpeting on a street corner. Replay   For me it’s the smaller things, for they are legion and just as lovely. A basket of groceries left on a doorstep. A hand-written letter to an old friend. Rural neighbours gathering, at a safe distance, for a chinwag and a beer over the back fence. A gift. A surprise. An approach. Pleas made, heard, answered. They’re all so tiny and bright. They’re spreading, too; each warm act sparking a glow in another, like a chain of globes, blinking on and lighting up, one by one.Blink. Still here.Blink. Still smiling.Blink. Still love you. When the shutdown began, Christina Melrose was having a shit afternoon. She’s the regional general manager of a residential disability support service, and doing a PhD in psychology, and raising three kids, so is “naturally horrifically disorganised”. “I’d had a fairly intense day at work, with communicable disease planning, and was just feeling a bit flat,” Melrose, 35, tells me (via phone, because that’s the only wise way to interview people right now). “I was definitely due for a bit of a pick-me-up.” Instead, she pulled into her greengrocer, Gippsland Fresh Wholesale, in Warragul east of Melbourne, and her day got worse. She saw a woman in a tizz. Frantic. She couldn’t find food for her dog on the denuded shelves, and was close to tears. Melrose couldn’t help, so she trudged away, shoulders slumped, and began loading the car. Hard day. Christina Melrose, who gave away toilet rolls in a carpark: “This one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on people I’m never likely to meet.”Credit:Josh Robenstone  There in her boot, she noticed her stash of Who Gives A Crap toilet paper. Melrose has been a subscriber to the charitable service for a while, so she won’t face any shortage. On a whim, she snatched up the pack and skipped through the carpark. She left rolls on roofs and bonnets and side mirrors. She moved with stealth but one lady spotted her, and instantly started crying. Weeping, in fact. The woman had Crohn’s disease – an inflammatory bowel condition – and had been down to her last roll. Melrose fetched her another. Then another woman, witnessing this, handed over the roll Melrose had left for her. “This poor woman – now with three rolls – grabbed me and gave me a big hug, which you can’t exactly say no to,” says Melrose. “She was sobbing. And I was sobbing.” The interaction buoyed her. She told two mates about it online that night; then the alerts began to pop up. Melrose had been tagged. A few of the recipients of her kindness had not needed her TP, and apparently paid her rolls forward. One was handed to an expectant mother. Another to an elderly man on a mobility scooter. “It was amazing how this one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on all these other people I’m never likely to meet,” Melrose says. “I never imagined that toilet paper could be a mechanism for division or unity. It’s that old adage: if you’ve got more than you need, you build a longer table, not a higher fence.” What’s extraordinary about a story like this one is that, in this moment we’re facing – this pause in our lives – such stories have become ordinary. Dr Catherine Barrett was at home in St Kilda on Saturday March 14, alone except for her schnauzer, Agnes. This was in the early days of panic buying, and the La Trobe University researcher and elderly advocacy expert was watching the news. Supermarket workers were breaking up brawls, sporting scratches and bruises. “I’ve had depression and anxiety in the past, and I know enough about my mental health to know that in situations like this I have to be proactive,” says Barrett. “For me it’s eating good food, and exercising, but also finding something, psychologically, to grab a hold of. Kindness seemed to calm my anxiety. I found myself listening to the health reports and government advice each day, but then switching off and focusing on stories of love and hope, and people doing beautiful, constructive things.” It became a salve. It was good for her; it had to be good for others. So she sat down at her little desk, in her two-room studio, and created a Facebook page called The Kindness Pandemic – an online repository for all things joyous. Barrett got a few dozen followers quickly enough. Then a few hundred. A few thousand. Within a few days, 60,000. Within a week, 250,000. At the time of writing, the group has more than half a million members. The page is a vertiginous giddy spool of good deeds and encouragement. There are long testimonials, videos and cute photos, but Barrett’s favourites are the simple ones, like this: I bought a caramel Twirl. At a supermarket. And I gave it to the staff member. And she cried. “You’ve spent $2.50, and you’ve transformed that person’s experience and reality,” Barrett says. “And I just thought, ‘This can be so simple. Everybody can do this.’ ” And people are. Within 30 seconds online I find myself clicking through from The Kindness Pandemic to Love Your Neighbour to the Preston Good Karma Network to Viral Kindness Northern Beaches Sydney to The Frankston Community Noticeboard, and that’s just on Facebook. In the current crisis, a community network like Nextdoor, a hyperlocal app which helps users reach out to those who live nearby, has come into its own. Victoria Vassallo, 22, joined last year, to stay in touch with other South Yarra residents about local break-ins. As the pandemic took hold, the fifth-year Monash University arts/law student thought of another use: offering spare boxes of tampons and pads to women running low. She wrote a post, not expecting to hear much, then came the urgent replies: “Do you have any super period pads available?” and “OMG so need some!” The next day – taking a break from the books, equity law specifically – Vassallo took a short walk to leave a box of pads (Evamay regular) for a woman recovering at home after surgery. “We’re in such a weird time, with so much negativity and hurt, and people losing their jobs, we just need to look around to see if we can help,” she says. “Give away something you don’t need. It’s our duty as citizens.” Replay   Adam Lust couldn’t agree more. He usually spends his Monday through Sunday in a Lexus SUV, ferrying people throughout Melbourne for Nicerride, his premium carriage service. The novel coronavirus has crippled his small business. Lust has barely had a paid job since mid-March. Yet this was the message he sent to his regular clients: If anyone you know, particularly the elderly or unwell, needs anything picked up or delivered from a chemist or a supermarket or post office or anywhere else, we are happy to volunteer our help in any way we can. Soon enough he was in his suit for his first free delivery: groceries and snacks for the families of the tiny patients at Monash Children’s Hospital. A few days later, some of that kindness came flowing back, when a client booked a midnight run, then paid Lust double the fare. “It might just help me cover my rent this week,” he says. “This is the power of relationships. This is humanity.” He’s not the only one using a dormant vehicle well. “DJ Nige” (Nigel Beck, 63) usually spins tunes in Deirdre, his green 1970 Volkswagen Kombi, but every booking has vanished, from the Collingwood Football Club season launch to his own daughter’s wedding. So DJ Nige just drives around Gippsland now, stopping in country towns to play What the World Needs Now Is Love and other tunes. His roadshow might take in Moe, Morwell, Maffra, who knows. “I’ll just go where the mood takes me,” Nige says. “I get such a beautiful reaction: kids busting a few moves, a few people crying.” Altona IGA owner Hitesh Palta, left, with a customer. His supermarket was the first to introduce an elderly-only shopping hour.Credit:Jason South In an otherwise ageist world, the elderly are being treated as they should. Most supermarket chains in Australia swiftly launched dedicated shopping hours, to give the vulnerable a chance to gather supplies before the shelves are stripped bare each day – but the practice actually began at a little IGA in suburban Melbourne’s Altona with owner Hitesh Palta. Palta had seen the footage of clamouring masses, and lines for hand sanitiser, and knew he had to act. “I never thought our society would … do something like this that would hurt our elderly,” he said. “We need to stick together at this time. We all need to help one another through this.” That’s precisely what Sumit Malhotra was thinking when he began offering free daily takeaway meals to senior citizens at the six Aangan Indian restaurants he owns throughout Victoria. Malhotra, who grew up in Jaipur, had witnessed his sales fall from the usual level by 25 per cent one week, 40 per cent the next, 70 per cent the week after. But he wasn’t thinking of that when he saw a disoriented old lady outside her grocer. She had wanted meat but couldn’t find any. No pasta, either. She was spinning – panicked and afraid. “I said, ‘My restaurant is next door. Why don’t you come next door and I’ll cook you something?’ She had a lamb curry and tried to give me money. I said, ‘No, and tomorrow if there is a problem again, you come straight here.’ When people are pressing the panic button, we need to do something to help people feel calm and secure. These acts of kindness: they are like a virus, too. People see them, and there is this human tendency to follow good things.” This is correct. We are wired this way. “What’s interesting about kindness is we do it for the benefit of others, but it also gives the giver a little booster shot. All of that benefits the group, too, so it’s not just win-win. It’s actually a win-win-win situation.” That’s Professor Lea Waters, founder of the Centre for Positive Psychology at Melbourne University. Waters researches and teaches the science of happiness, at least when she isn’t holed up at home in the eastern suburb of Blackburn with two teenagers. Waters says evolutionary psychologists have long found evidence of the “social glue” that holds us together – kindness, compassion, empathy, altruism – throughout history, across all cultures. The obvious emotional benefits are not intangible, either. “There’s extensive research into what happens when someone laughs with you, and how that changes your physiology, and how your brain gets a little shot of oxytocin, which makes you feel bonded, and which lowers your cortisol level, which relieves stress, which increases our ability to function well,” Waters says. “Intimacy has this biological effect, allowing the individual, and the group, to soothe itself.” Anna Krien left handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood asking if they needed help with anything. Credit:Jesse Marlow Before people began printing pro forma notes to leave in letterboxes, offering to help their neighbours in need – a wonderful idea – the author Anna Krien was already leaving handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood. She posted one note online, with an offer to drop off food or wine, magazines or books, even precious toilet roll. It was decorated with a crayon drawing of a shark, by one of her young sons. “It just seemed like a normal and natural thing to do,” she tells me. “To let people know we’re here, we’re thinking of them, we have legs, and youth. We can scout for them.” Dr Raj, a few doors down, was desperate for porridge, so she found him some oats. “We’ll have more orders coming in soon; people are getting nervous. We may live to regret it.” Krien laughs, with a hint of fatalism, and we talk about the implicit reward in offering to help someone out. “In a sense there’s a degree of selfishness to it,” she says. “Nietzsche talks about how charity is more about making the giver feel good than actually doing something helpful.” She may be referring to his book On the Genealogy of Morals, in which the philosopher suggests giving and helping are “petty” pleasures, and refers to good deeds as “the happiness of ‘slight superiority’ ”. “Maybe it was just a thing that made us feel good,” Krien muses. “So far, even though we’re all obsessed with coronavirus, things have been easy, but we don’t know how it’s going to go. Come the Depression, I’d like to think I’ll be one of those people who take others in for a meal. I hope I would be.” I wonder if she thinks we’ll be changed by this in a positive way. Will we take succour from the altruism around us, and carry that into whatever our next reality holds? Krien pauses. “Probably not … ” she says. “We might have this brief scare, try to get our priorities straight. But fear and trauma can do ugly things, too.” I worry that the kindnesses we have witnessed so far – which seem so overwhelming in number and nature – only seem that way because we’re looking for them, because we crave them. Ever since the rise of the alt right, Trumpism, Brexit chaos, #MeToo and the climate catastrophe, we have sought snug little stories of safety and comfort. Media organisations globally now curate heart-warming tales into landing pages and content streams. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age recently added sections to their websites called, simply, “Good News” – where readers can devour stories about pandemic pen pals, suburban teddy bear hunts or self-isolated opera singers performing I Still Call Australia Home from a unit balcony in Sydney’s Waterloo. Maybe we’re witnessing all this positivity now because it’s all we can bear to see. Replay   I’m also struck by how many of those doing good deeds tend to already be carers. At random I find five touching stories of empathy online – from a lady distributing care packages to the disabled, to a woman purchasing pet food en masse for an animal shelter – and contact them. And those five people are, in order, a community health care worker from Melbourne’s Coburg, a road trauma recovery specialist from Sydney’s Vaucluse, an Adult Intensive Care Unit nurse from Brisbane, the convenor of an online support group for Pakistani mums, and a primary school integration aide. So have we really been changed by this harsh moment, or are we just finally noticing the do-gooders in our midst? I would like to think, at least, that the inventive acts of human connection we’re witnessing are something fresh. We’re certainly coming up with new expressions – like “caremongering”, or being “groupish” (instead of selfish) – for behaviours born largely online. Something does seem to have shifted in the digital realm. The pandemic becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? Look no further than writer and refugee advocate Nadine Cohen, whose Twitter identity – all her posts are written in capital letters and start with the words F… YEAH – is a mixture of hilarious righteous outrage and raw compassion. A recent post offered a shout out to a lovely worker at Baker’s Delight in Bondi Junction, who at closing time offered her a free bag of bread rolls then – once she learnt she was about to visit Somalian refugees self-isolating in Merrylands – gave her seven bags instead. “It was really nice of her,” says Cohen. “There’s been so much attention paid to the hoarding, and fights in supermarkets, but I’ve seen a lot of warmth, both offline and online.” Cohen was once a creative strategist for Google, and has found Twitter in particular to be a newly positive space. Notwithstanding misinformation about bogus coronavirus cures, or ineffective recipes for home-made hand sanitiser – or racist attacks on Asian Australians – the goodwill has been overwhelming. “We’ve gotten more donations than we can fit in my car. We’ve been humbled by kindness, more than wounded by nastiness.” Social media, formerly a place of wasted hours, cyber bullying and narcissism, appears to have morphed into a force for good. Even the celebrity posturing feels more real than affectation. It’s actually quite nice to watch Keith Urban singing on Instagram, thanking healthcare workers and first responders, while Our Nicole dances in the foreground like a barefoot goofball. It’s cute listening to J-Lo and A-Rod do the “couples challenge”: answering stupid, funny questions about their life together in isolation, however gilded and privileged that existence might be. And it’s downright beautiful to hear Patrick Stewart reading Shakespearean sonnets, because such posts are now something more than light entertainment, they’re moments of connection. Hand in hand with this renewed intimacy online has come the decline in IRL (in real life) obligations. No more work dinners or cocktail functions or coffee meetings. Any meetings, really. Nor any school fêtes or parent-teacher interviews. The pandemic thus becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? In the blurb for her book Happy Never After: Why the Happiness Fairytale is Driving Us Mad (and How I Flipped the Script), writer Jill Stark asks, “What would happen if we stopped chasing, stayed still, found calm and meaning in places we least expected?” I wonder if 2020 is our chance to answer that question. “I think 21st-century living, for many of us, has felt like we’re pounding a treadmill and going nowhere. It’s fast-paced, relentless, endless, and in an age in which we’re so connected online we’re still profoundly disconnected from each other – and from our own wants and needs,” Stark tells me from her desk. She talks about our uniquely modern malaise – “the cult of busyness” – and how racing towards burnout has become a competitive sport. “For many people, this will be the first time they’ll have to be still,” says Stark, who is also a consultant for Beyond Blue. “Human nature tells us we quickly switch back to old habits and forget the reasons we wanted to make a change, but for some people – hopefully – this moment of logging off and pausing will profoundly alter the way they live their lives going forward, reminding them of what matters – and who matters – most.” For the Sunshine Singers, a mixed seniors choir who meet for two hours every Monday morning, and have done for a decade, what matters most is music, and one another. The group, run by Waverley Council in Sydney’s east, has been tested more than most this past month. It is usually three dozen strong at Bondi Pavilion, but herding them together online – for their first ever gathering by video conference – was a challenge. “They can be a bit technophobic,” laughs Cassy Bartolomei, 55, the freelance singer and teacher who leads them. “When the soft shutdown began, I was worried. A lot of them are truly stuck at home. And a lot of them live alone.” The choir is their weekly chance to venture outside, from their apartments and aged care facilities in Homebush, Concord, Bronte. They usually start with scales and rounds, and learn a new song before recapping old ones. This time Bartolomei didn’t teach them anything new. They belted out You’re the Voice by John Farnham. They crooned Young at Heart by Frank Sinatra. The song they did last was Close to You, by the Carpenters: Why do birds, suddenly appear, every time, you are near? Just like me, they long to be, close to you… The Sunshine Singers, a seniors choir from Sydney’s east, make beautiful music together, now online.Credit:@waverleycouncil/Instargram It’s challenging. The platform means they can’t all hear one another, so they aren’t getting the raised endorphins they usually do when their voices unite. There are lags and connectivity issues. It’s messy. “But they can see everyone, their mouths moving,” says Bartolomei. “It is so much better than nothing.” They all felt happier just for having a sing. One woman is on a post-cancer drug program, with a repressed immune system: “I’m so alone and lonely,” she said. “This has just lifted my day.” Another woman said her smile was back: “My body is tingling.

Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald’s newsletter here and The Age’s here. Bartolomei was, in truth, thrilled before they even began – when they first appeared on her computer display. She’d sent them links and download instructions, but still wondered how they would cope. “I was terrified,” she laughs. “I thought I was going to sit here alone, with people not knowing what button to press.” She needn’t have fretted. “One member is in her 90s, and there she was! Her little face, in a square, on the screen, on Monday morning!” Bartolomei says. “Then all these other little beautiful faces started appearing. Bing! Bing!! Bing-Bing-Bing!!! They were just so divine.” They’re all looking forward to next Monday morning, too, when they get to sing together again, see their friends again, when their faces will pop into the frame again, one after another, and another, coronavirus be damned. Bing! Still here.Bing! Still together.Bing! Still singing. To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

Profiteering, finger pointing and fear. The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the worst in some. But look a little deeper and a far more potent story is unfolding: one of kindness, connection and trust. By Konrad Marshall Taking it to the streets … chamber musician Josephine Vains plays a social distancing “concert” for her neighbourhood in Melbourne’s Brunswick.Credit:Chris Hopkins It’s the end of the last Sunday in March, and after dipping low in the vanilla autumn sky, the sun throws all its light on MacFarland Street. A yellow glow kisses this little road in Brunswick, in Melbourne’s inner north. It dances on the puddles left by an afternoon storm. Catches the buzzing mozzies. Hits old chimneys, and iron lace balustrades, and aluminium roofs. And one musical instrument. The latter is an antique cello, made in 1830 of flamed maple and spruce, by a master craftsman from London. And it is embraced by its owner, Josephine Vains, who sits on a chair between two paperbark trees – near her parsley patch and her passionfruit creeper and her yellow recycling bin – on the footpath in front of her cream brick home. Musician Josephine Vains: “This is my way of feeling like I’m continuing to do what I always do. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.""Credit:Chris Hopkins Vains, 45, is a chamber musician who has played with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and taught at the Victorian College of the Arts. She has performed in European cathedrals of gothic splendour. Modern recital centres in the US. The ancient Longyou Caves in China. The bottom of a mine shaft in Macedon in Victoria’s Goldfields region. “Thank you for coming,” she says to her neighbours, around three dozen of whom have, on cue, left self-isolation to come together – while remaining many, many metres apart – for a little concert born on a local WhatsApp group. “I hope you enjoy the show.” They do. They might not recognise the last names of the long-dead composers on the set list, but they recognise beauty in suburbia. As Vains plays Gabrielli, a happy couple sitting on folding chairs – with teardrop wine glasses and a bottle of Margaret River cabernet sauvignon – rise to applaud. As she plays Saint-Saëns, a nuclear family crammed inside their blue Landrover Discovery are rapturous. As she plays the famous prelude from Cello Suite No. 1 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, others clap and grin from their verandahs and driveways, leaning against a front gate, or listening through an open bedroom window. “Beautiful!” yells one man, from a distance. “Thank you!” waves another. “Thanks Josie!” says her next-door neighbour. “That was the first time I’ve heard you,” adds a bloke from around the corner – an interloper from Osborne Street, two blocks down. “And I cried. It was really beautiful.” Vains smiles. All the paid performances on her calendar are cancelled due to COVID-19, but this makes that more bearable. She’s been playing a show at sunset every few days since the last week of March: a handful of songs, for this street and for herself. “This is my way of feeling … like I’m just continuing to do what I always do,” she says afterward. “I feel quite high now. It’s a natural high. And I think they feel that way, too. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.” Do we ever. It’s surreal, this silent, sequestered life we’re leading, this isolation in a coronaviral vacuum. It’s so often quiet and largely numb, yet punctuated by unwelcome sensations, isn’t it? You’ve probably felt one or two. The cold prickle of anxiety. The crack of social dislocation. For me it’s lethargy, sometimes as a sharp strain behind my eyes, but more often like a thick blanket. Every little thing now feels effortful and earnest. Shopping runs are missions during which we stand on crosses of electrical tape, listening to our own trepidatious gulps. Once outside, we can breathe again but heave the odd sad sigh, too, as we wander past shuttered shops. For the most part, we’ve all retreated behind closed doors, into a kind of collective, solitary darkness. Yet it is in this darkness that acts of kindness, and compassion, and levity, and connection – like a concert cellist playing beside a street gutter – stand out best. Some gestures flicker in our eyes like birthday candles. Others light up the night like benevolent flares. Everyone has a favourite pandemic pick-me-up. Perhaps you were touched by that co-ordinated minute of mass applause throughout the UK, as people stood clapping for the exhausted carers within their National Health Service. Or maybe you love the daily appointment Italians have kept, playing music together at dusk, singing Volare from a balcony, or trumpeting on a street corner. Replay   For me it’s the smaller things, for they are legion and just as lovely. A basket of groceries left on a doorstep. A hand-written letter to an old friend. Rural neighbours gathering, at a safe distance, for a chinwag and a beer over the back fence. A gift. A surprise. An approach. Pleas made, heard, answered. They’re all so tiny and bright. They’re spreading, too; each warm act sparking a glow in another, like a chain of globes, blinking on and lighting up, one by one.Blink. Still here.Blink. Still smiling.Blink. Still love you. When the shutdown began, Christina Melrose was having a shit afternoon. She’s the regional general manager of a residential disability support service, and doing a PhD in psychology, and raising three kids, so is “naturally horrifically disorganised”. “I’d had a fairly intense day at work, with communicable disease planning, and was just feeling a bit flat,” Melrose, 35, tells me (via phone, because that’s the only wise way to interview people right now). “I was definitely due for a bit of a pick-me-up.” Instead, she pulled into her greengrocer, Gippsland Fresh Wholesale, in Warragul east of Melbourne, and her day got worse. She saw a woman in a tizz. Frantic. She couldn’t find food for her dog on the denuded shelves, and was close to tears. Melrose couldn’t help, so she trudged away, shoulders slumped, and began loading the car. Hard day. Christina Melrose, who gave away toilet rolls in a carpark: “This one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on people I’m never likely to meet.”Credit:Josh Robenstone  There in her boot, she noticed her stash of Who Gives A Crap toilet paper. Melrose has been a subscriber to the charitable service for a while, so she won’t face any shortage. On a whim, she snatched up the pack and skipped through the carpark. She left rolls on roofs and bonnets and side mirrors. She moved with stealth but one lady spotted her, and instantly started crying. Weeping, in fact. The woman had Crohn’s disease – an inflammatory bowel condition – and had been down to her last roll. Melrose fetched her another. Then another woman, witnessing this, handed over the roll Melrose had left for her. “This poor woman – now with three rolls – grabbed me and gave me a big hug, which you can’t exactly say no to,” says Melrose. “She was sobbing. And I was sobbing.” The interaction buoyed her. She told two mates about it online that night; then the alerts began to pop up. Melrose had been tagged. A few of the recipients of her kindness had not needed her TP, and apparently paid her rolls forward. One was handed to an expectant mother. Another to an elderly man on a mobility scooter. “It was amazing how this one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on all these other people I’m never likely to meet,” Melrose says. “I never imagined that toilet paper could be a mechanism for division or unity. It’s that old adage: if you’ve got more than you need, you build a longer table, not a higher fence.” What’s extraordinary about a story like this one is that, in this moment we’re facing – this pause in our lives – such stories have become ordinary. Dr Catherine Barrett was at home in St Kilda on Saturday March 14, alone except for her schnauzer, Agnes. This was in the early days of panic buying, and the La Trobe University researcher and elderly advocacy expert was watching the news. Supermarket workers were breaking up brawls, sporting scratches and bruises. “I’ve had depression and anxiety in the past, and I know enough about my mental health to know that in situations like this I have to be proactive,” says Barrett. “For me it’s eating good food, and exercising, but also finding something, psychologically, to grab a hold of. Kindness seemed to calm my anxiety. I found myself listening to the health reports and government advice each day, but then switching off and focusing on stories of love and hope, and people doing beautiful, constructive things.” It became a salve. It was good for her; it had to be good for others. So she sat down at her little desk, in her two-room studio, and created a Facebook page called The Kindness Pandemic – an online repository for all things joyous. Barrett got a few dozen followers quickly enough. Then a few hundred. A few thousand. Within a few days, 60,000. Within a week, 250,000. At the time of writing, the group has more than half a million members. The page is a vertiginous giddy spool of good deeds and encouragement. There are long testimonials, videos and cute photos, but Barrett’s favourites are the simple ones, like this: I bought a caramel Twirl. At a supermarket. And I gave it to the staff member. And she cried. “You’ve spent $2.50, and you’ve transformed that person’s experience and reality,” Barrett says. “And I just thought, ‘This can be so simple. Everybody can do this.’ ” And people are. Within 30 seconds online I find myself clicking through from The Kindness Pandemic to Love Your Neighbour to the Preston Good Karma Network to Viral Kindness Northern Beaches Sydney to The Frankston Community Noticeboard, and that’s just on Facebook. In the current crisis, a community network like Nextdoor, a hyperlocal app which helps users reach out to those who live nearby, has come into its own. Victoria Vassallo, 22, joined last year, to stay in touch with other South Yarra residents about local break-ins. As the pandemic took hold, the fifth-year Monash University arts/law student thought of another use: offering spare boxes of tampons and pads to women running low. She wrote a post, not expecting to hear much, then came the urgent replies: “Do you have any super period pads available?” and “OMG so need some!” The next day – taking a break from the books, equity law specifically – Vassallo took a short walk to leave a box of pads (Evamay regular) for a woman recovering at home after surgery. “We’re in such a weird time, with so much negativity and hurt, and people losing their jobs, we just need to look around to see if we can help,” she says. “Give away something you don’t need. It’s our duty as citizens.” Replay   Adam Lust couldn’t agree more. He usually spends his Monday through Sunday in a Lexus SUV, ferrying people throughout Melbourne for Nicerride, his premium carriage service. The novel coronavirus has crippled his small business. Lust has barely had a paid job since mid-March. Yet this was the message he sent to his regular clients: If anyone you know, particularly the elderly or unwell, needs anything picked up or delivered from a chemist or a supermarket or post office or anywhere else, we are happy to volunteer our help in any way we can. Soon enough he was in his suit for his first free delivery: groceries and snacks for the families of the tiny patients at Monash Children’s Hospital. A few days later, some of that kindness came flowing back, when a client booked a midnight run, then paid Lust double the fare. “It might just help me cover my rent this week,” he says. “This is the power of relationships. This is humanity.” He’s not the only one using a dormant vehicle well. “DJ Nige” (Nigel Beck, 63) usually spins tunes in Deirdre, his green 1970 Volkswagen Kombi, but every booking has vanished, from the Collingwood Football Club season launch to his own daughter’s wedding. So DJ Nige just drives around Gippsland now, stopping in country towns to play What the World Needs Now Is Love and other tunes. His roadshow might take in Moe, Morwell, Maffra, who knows. “I’ll just go where the mood takes me,” Nige says. “I get such a beautiful reaction: kids busting a few moves, a few people crying.” Altona IGA owner Hitesh Palta, left, with a customer. His supermarket was the first to introduce an elderly-only shopping hour.Credit:Jason South In an otherwise ageist world, the elderly are being treated as they should. Most supermarket chains in Australia swiftly launched dedicated shopping hours, to give the vulnerable a chance to gather supplies before the shelves are stripped bare each day – but the practice actually began at a little IGA in suburban Melbourne’s Altona with owner Hitesh Palta. Palta had seen the footage of clamouring masses, and lines for hand sanitiser, and knew he had to act. “I never thought our society would … do something like this that would hurt our elderly,” he said. “We need to stick together at this time. We all need to help one another through this.” That’s precisely what Sumit Malhotra was thinking when he began offering free daily takeaway meals to senior citizens at the six Aangan Indian restaurants he owns throughout Victoria. Malhotra, who grew up in Jaipur, had witnessed his sales fall from the usual level by 25 per cent one week, 40 per cent the next, 70 per cent the week after. But he wasn’t thinking of that when he saw a disoriented old lady outside her grocer. She had wanted meat but couldn’t find any. No pasta, either. She was spinning – panicked and afraid. “I said, ‘My restaurant is next door. Why don’t you come next door and I’ll cook you something?’ She had a lamb curry and tried to give me money. I said, ‘No, and tomorrow if there is a problem again, you come straight here.’ When people are pressing the panic button, we need to do something to help people feel calm and secure. These acts of kindness: they are like a virus, too. People see them, and there is this human tendency to follow good things.” This is correct. We are wired this way. “What’s interesting about kindness is we do it for the benefit of others, but it also gives the giver a little booster shot. All of that benefits the group, too, so it’s not just win-win. It’s actually a win-win-win situation.” That’s Professor Lea Waters, founder of the Centre for Positive Psychology at Melbourne University. Waters researches and teaches the science of happiness, at least when she isn’t holed up at home in the eastern suburb of Blackburn with two teenagers. Waters says evolutionary psychologists have long found evidence of the “social glue” that holds us together – kindness, compassion, empathy, altruism – throughout history, across all cultures. The obvious emotional benefits are not intangible, either. “There’s extensive research into what happens when someone laughs with you, and how that changes your physiology, and how your brain gets a little shot of oxytocin, which makes you feel bonded, and which lowers your cortisol level, which relieves stress, which increases our ability to function well,” Waters says. “Intimacy has this biological effect, allowing the individual, and the group, to soothe itself.” Anna Krien left handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood asking if they needed help with anything. Credit:Jesse Marlow Before people began printing pro forma notes to leave in letterboxes, offering to help their neighbours in need – a wonderful idea – the author Anna Krien was already leaving handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood. She posted one note online, with an offer to drop off food or wine, magazines or books, even precious toilet roll. It was decorated with a crayon drawing of a shark, by one of her young sons. “It just seemed like a normal and natural thing to do,” she tells me. “To let people know we’re here, we’re thinking of them, we have legs, and youth. We can scout for them.” Dr Raj, a few doors down, was desperate for porridge, so she found him some oats. “We’ll have more orders coming in soon; people are getting nervous. We may live to regret it.” Krien laughs, with a hint of fatalism, and we talk about the implicit reward in offering to help someone out. “In a sense there’s a degree of selfishness to it,” she says. “Nietzsche talks about how charity is more about making the giver feel good than actually doing something helpful.” She may be referring to his book On the Genealogy of Morals, in which the philosopher suggests giving and helping are “petty” pleasures, and refers to good deeds as “the happiness of ‘slight superiority’ ”. “Maybe it was just a thing that made us feel good,” Krien muses. “So far, even though we’re all obsessed with coronavirus, things have been easy, but we don’t know how it’s going to go.

She’d sent them links and download instructions, but still wondered how they would cope. “I was terrified,” she laughs. “I thought I was going to sit here alone, with people not knowing what button to press.” She needn’t have fretted. “One member is in her 90s, and there she was! Her little face, in a square, on the screen, on Monday morning!” Bartolomei says. “Then all these other little beautiful faces started appearing. Bing! Bing!! Bing-Bing-Bing!!! They were just so divine.” They’re all looking forward to next Monday morning, too, when they get to sing together again, see their friends again, when their faces will pop into the frame again, one after another, and another, coronavirus be damned.

By Nigel Gladstone and Mark Stehle  Credit:Mark Stehle Less than four months after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in China, the global pandemic has killed more than 90,000 people and shutdown societies in Europe, America and Asia. The creep of coronavirus across Australia caught many people off guard despite weeks of warnings. Politicians were confident the 200 confirmed COVID-19 cases were under control on March 13 and told Australians they were going to the football on Saturday. The borders were closed on March 20, blocking all foreigners. Thousands of businesses were forced to shut on March 23 as coronavirus cases topped 1600. A week later, people leaving home ""unless absolutely necessary"" risk fines and jail. These charts track the number of new cases and deaths each day and are updated regularly with data from Johns Hopkins University. The pandemic is still accelerating after taking 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 infections. It took 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, four days to add another 100,000 and just three days to reach 400,000 on March 25. A week later, there were more than a million cases. The pace of this pandemic is hard to understand because psychologically we struggle with exponential increases. Psychologists call this 'exponential growth bias'. People tend to think along linear growth lines (1, 2, 3, 4) even when it doesn't describe the reality unfolding before us. Exponential increases mean the numbers may double every few days. Italy was the first European country to go into regional lockdowns, culminating on March 8 with confinement of 16 million people in the north. But it took a while for people to respect the rules, with Italian police issuing more than 175,000 fines for breaking quarantine. On March 10, the entire country was locked down. On March 24, the maximum penalty for Italians caught leaving their home for no good reason was lifted to €3000 (around $5500), up from €206 ($375). Social restrictions and quarantines have been introduced gradually in most countries over several days and weeks, which means tracking exactly when lockdowns began is not possible. But the lag between when widely applied lockdowns begin and daily new infections and deaths decline is roughly a month. The three-to-four week lag correlates with China’s lockdown of Hubei province, the birthplace of the virus, on January 23. China was overwhelmed for more than a month, but extreme lockdowns – including a ban on all transport into and out of Wuhan with no exceptions for personal or medical emergencies – ‘flattened the curve’. China has started lifting restrictions, with people allowed to leave Wuhan for the first time on Wednesday. The first case detected in Canada came on the same day as Australia’s first, January 25. Some Canadian provinces began restrictions – such as closing bars – before Australia acted and up until late March, Canada had fewer coronavirus cases. But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resisted putting the country into a nationwide lockdown like the UK did on March 23 and Australia did a week later. Canada closed its border with the world's largest infected population in the USA on March 21, but travel for work and to transport goods has continued. The United States, where infections are now more than twice the number seen anywhere else in the world, has no nationwide lockdown. Some cities, counties and states – including California and New York state – have put restrictions on citizens since mid-March, but the virus has spread widely. President Donald Trump expressed outrage on March 24, refusing to ""close the country"", saying he “would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter”. But Mr Trump has changed his stance recently, warning Americans on Sunday to prepare for the ""toughest week"" of the coronavirus pandemic. Most Americans are now living under stay-at-home orders or other forms of lockdown imposed by state governments. Politicians in Italy, the UK, Sweden and America all mistakenly believed they could let COVID-19 sweep through the community, withstand a few weeks of hospitals being overloaded and then cases would fall due to herd immunity, Flinders University Professor of Medicine Nikolai Petrovsky said. ""Too many commentators made incorrect comparisons between COVID-19 and influenza,"" Professor Petrovsky said. ""The whole concept of easily achieving herd immunity was always completely spurious and would mean accepting over 60 million deaths globally and 250,000 deaths just in Australia. ""If we controlled the rate to 10,000 infections per day in Australia, it would take 5.7 years (to develop herd immunity)."" The United Kingdom is about two weeks behind when Italy hit 100 cases. In places where stringent precautions and high rates of testing have been implemented, such as in Taiwan and South Korea, the epidemic curves have been relatively flat.

19,/technology/how-to-stay-safe-on-houseparty-and-zoom-20200408-p54i8z.html,How to stay safe on Houseparty and Zoom,"As almost every interaction we have with people outside of our own household moves online, easy-to-use and platform agnostic video services like Houseparty and Zoom have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services where designed for, with the former emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online and the latter optimised for business meetings. Replay   While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, here are some tips to stay safe. This is a mobile-focused video chat app for iOS, Android and computers which was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games in the middle of last year.  It wasn't especially well known until everyone started looking for a good way to catch up with their friends virtually from isolation. Houseparty is  a straightforward app that connects up to eight people at a time for video hangouts and simple games, without many settings or advanced features, but there are still a few things you should look out for. Friends are added by entering in their exact username or allowing the app to look through your contacts or Facebook friends. If you allow the app to see your location, you can also request to be friends with people physically near you (kind of moot during a global shutdown). Because you're likely to end up with a very diverse list of friends, it's important to get to know the ""lock"" feature. Hitting the padlock once a chat's going makes it so nobody else can drop in without asking. By default, people using Houseparty can see when their friends are in a room and will be able to barge right in, so you could conceivably end up in a chat with friends of friends you don't know. If you never want to be in an open room like this, you can enable private mode in settings to automatically lock every room you're in. As its name suggests Houseparty was designed for casual, open gatherings. Houseparty has become a popular app for school-aged kids who want to keep up with friends from home. If you're worried about your child using Houseparty you should make sure they know to use the lock or private mode options, and that they're only adding people they know personally. Houseparty is a less scary service than many in this sense, because you can essentially only add people you know, but if you don't lock the rooms or if you're playing fast and loose accepting Facebook friend requests it could still get dicey. Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. Finally, there were rumours circulating last month that installing Houseparty allowed hackers to take control of your other accounts including Spotify and even banks. This is very likely not the case. The Houseparty app only asks for permissions it needs (microphone and camera, plus optionally contacts, Facebook or location), and there's no indication it has suffered any kind of data breach. Focused less on socialising and more on remote conferencing for businesses and schools, Zoom has also seen a massive uptick in users since social isolation measures began, with the company behind the service saying there are now 200 million people using it, up from 10 million just weeks ago. This is a much more versatile program with a lot of features and settings, which is great for general business use but has caused some issues now that there are 20 times more people on board. Potential weaknesses in Zoom's encryption standards have seen companies, including NASA and more recently Google banning their employees from using Zoom when working from home. While iffy encryption is a serious concern for secretive businesses and government agencies, most regular folk don't need to worry as much. You should be more concerned with locking down your settings to block out scammers and interlopers. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson caused a stir when he ran a Cabinet meeting on Zoom last month. Credit:Twitter/@BorisJohnson By default Zoom trades quite a bit of security for increased convenience, and while the company has been working to strike a better balance since reports of ""Zoombombing"" started making international headlines, there are still several things you should do. By default you need a meeting ID and a password to join a Zoom call, and making sure you only distribute these to the people you actually want to join is the most important step to prevent uninvited guests, or Zoombombers. Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. You also have the option of sending a Zoom URL, which combines the ID and password so users can join the meeting in a single click. This is the most convenient option, but not the safest. Aside from making it easier for an invitation to fall into the wrong hands, it also encourages people to click apparent Zoom URLs that land in their email inbox, which are increasingly being used by scammers to steal personal info. To be safe, distribute meeting IDs and passwords instead. Attendees can enter these in the Zoom app or website to access a meeting. Every Zoom user also has a personal meeting ID, which other users can use to connect directly to you at any time. Think of it like your own office, where people you know can drop by unannounced. You have the option to use this ID when setting up meetings, but from a security standpoint that's a bad idea. Stick to generating new, randomised meeting IDs each time, and prevent your personal ID from being published on the internet in any capacity. And just in case, despite your best efforts, someone dodgy does make it into your Zoom chat, there are a couple of settings in your profile you should change from the defaults to limit the potential damage. Specifically, make it so that only the host (i.e. you) can share their screen, and turn off file transfers. If you are Zoombombed, the last thing you want is for your meeting to become an impromptu pornography party, or for the scammer on the other end to start distributing malware.

The NRL has earmarked May 28 as the day the premiership will recommence, although they need the players’ union to first agree to the revenues, operating costs and welfare provisions in order for that to happen. Replay   The Rugby League Players Association and head office had agreed to a new pay deal based on the worst-case scenario of no matches being played in 2020, with the parties still yet to agree to the terms of a resumption. That includes receiving a minimum of 29.5 per cent of any additional revenue that could flow into the game as a result in play resuming. The players are keen to return to the field but first want some assurances before doing so. That includes an understanding of the NRL’s operational costs to restart, an important consideration given the stinging criticism head office has received over how much money is being spent to run the game. The Herald last month revealed Rugby League Central spends almost $500,000 a day to run the competition, while broadcast partner Channel Nine - the publishers of this masthead - claims countless millions were “squandered by a bloated head office” in an extraordinary broadside on Thursday. RLPA CEO Clint Newton said the game can’t restart until his members are given assurances about the manner in which it will do so. RLPA board member Daly Cherry-Evans and his fellow NRL players are yet to sign off on a May 28 return.Credit:Getty “I’d like to think it won’t be like a CBA negotiation given the time criticalities associated with this,” Newton said. “We need to be very clear on what’s been brought in and that we’re agreeing on the operational costs. We then need to reach agreement over the distribution to the stakeholder groups over those revenues. “There are a number of key areas and we need to work through the detail. A lot will hinge on what we’re able to generate when building those contract arrangements. “To be clear, we understand why the NRL have proposed a start date. But there are things critical in all of this and that’s why the player consultation process and engagement is paramount. “We still need that information before the players are in a position to endorse or support it. That’s around the welfare and well-being support, the injury management and the revenue, which comes in two parts - the operational costs and the distribution of the revenues.” The RLPA have negotiated the right to conduct a special purpose audit of the NRL’s books and are likely to commence that process next week. The players are keen to understand why the game’s running costs are currently $181 million per annum and what steps the NRL will take to reduce them. The union also wants assurances the health of the players won’t be compromised during the coronavirus, while wanting the Warriors to be given every support while they are away from home. That could include having their families travel with them to Australia. “Player well-being and welfare support (are key considerations),” Newton said. “Medical and injury management, the treatment of injuries and access to facilities and revenue. “We want to know what revenue we are able to generate via a revised competition and one that may be without crowds for an entire year. “Then the operational costs of ensuring best practice is applied and then the percentage distribution of that revenue.” Adrian Proszenko is the Chief Rugby League Reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald.

Employees have told of customers openly coughing in store, coming too close to a pregnant worker, and revealing that although they were meant to be in quarantine, they were out shopping because they ""needed a break"". JB Hi-Fi stores still remain open during the coronavirus pandemic, causing angst for a number of its employees. Credit:Patrick Durkin The retail workers' union said it had been in contact with major stores nationwide as they fielded concerns from staff working during the outbreak. A JB Hi-Fi employee, who didn't want to be named, described the company's decision to keep its doors open as ""crazy"". The employee said many customers had ""no regard for staff"". ""Yesterday, a family of four came into our store and coughed openly ... multiple times, and then continued to touch multiple items while the children ran around without restraint,"" the employee said. Replay   ""I have customers that touch multiple items in the store while they're just 'killing time' because they're bored at home and wanted to get out for a bit. ""We have had customers who tell us they are supposed to be in quarantine but just needed 'a break'."" The electronics retailer refused to comment but their website said no more than 100 people, including staff, were allowed in stores at one time, depending on the size of the outlet. ""Which seems to me to be crazy because if you can't have more than five people at a wedding, how can you have 100 people indoors?"" the staff member said. The JB Hi-Fi staff member said she was becoming more and more distressed as time went on. ""I'm grateful to have a job, don't get me wrong, but it gets to a point where [you ask], 'Is our safety being prioritised over sales?' and, to be honest, I don't think it is. ""We are scared and desperate. Our business is doing the bare minimum of the government regulations, but as long as they continue to make money, we will be put at risk.""

""Yesterday, a family of four came into our store and coughed openly ... multiple times, and then continued to touch multiple items while the children ran around without restraint,"" the employee said.

The electronics retailer refused to comment but their website said no more than 100 people, including staff, were allowed in stores at one time, depending on the size of the outlet. ""Which seems to me to be crazy because if you can't have more than five people at a wedding, how can you have 100 people indoors?"" the staff member said.

When Bishop met her British counterpart, he had a surprise for the Australian foreign affairs minister. It was a shirt emblazoned with one message: “Save the pangolin”. Ending the illegal wildlife trade, including that of the pangolin, was then one of Jonhson’s pet projects. A little over two years later, Johnson is in a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, struck down by a virus that may have spread to humans by the very mammal he was trying to save. The prime minister’s hospitalisation this week has darkened Britain’s resolve when it needed inspiration from its larger-than-life leader. Replay   It has exposed a potential flaw in the British system; with its lack of written constitution and codified order of succession for prime minister, there is now a leadership vacuum at a time when some of the most important decisions in the nation’s history will need to be made. It has left the world without the one leader who could credibly serve as a bridge between US President Donald Trump and Europe. And as the world enters an uncertain and pivotal few months, it has also highlighted the need to spare global leaders from this lethal virus as they try to stop its spread. Read more from Anthony Galloway on how Johnson's hospitalisation exposes potential flaws in the British system.

But look a little deeper and a far more potent story is unfolding: one of kindness, connection and trust. Good Weekend's Konrad Marshall has written about moments when coronavirus has become a force for good. ""It’s surreal, this silent, sequestered life we’re leading, this isolation in a coronaviral vacuum. It’s so often quiet and largely numb, yet punctuated by unwelcome sensations, isn’t it? You’ve probably felt one or two,"" he writes. ""Yet it is in this darkness that acts of kindness, and compassion, and levity, and connection – like a concert cellist playing beside a street gutter – stand out best. Some gestures flicker in our eyes like birthday candles. Others light up the night like benevolent flares. Everyone has a favourite pandemic pick-me-up."" Josephine Vains, 45, has been playing the cello on the footpath in front of her cream brick home. “This is my way of feeling … like I’m just continuing to do what I always do,” she says. “It’s a natural high.

The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. The terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. ""The aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,"" she said in a statement. ""We will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time."" AAP NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed one person in NSW, who is critically ill with coronavirus, is on ECMO. Here's a lay person description of how ECMO works: extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) takes over a patient's lung or heart function, reoxygenating their blood and removing carbon dioxide externally. Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. The state’s healthcare workers will now get free parking at hospitals in a bid to ease the pressure on those working on the COVID-19 frontline. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said all staff rostered to work at hospitals, including cleaners, security staff, allied health workers as well as nurses and doctors, will have access to the free parking from today. “It is critical that our frontline workers are able to access their place of work as easily as possible and we are taking these measures to ensure that is the case,” he said. Mr Hazzard said local councils were also working to help improve parking near health facilities. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was doing “whatever we can” to support hospital staff. “We hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.” Maureen Jacotine 86 year old resident of Uniting's Aldersgate aged care facility began crying while speaking with her family via Zoom. Credit:SMH Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services where designed for, with the former optimised for business meetings and the latter emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online. While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, Tim Biggs has some tips to stay safe. For Zoom: Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. For Houseparty: Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. More than 60,000 Australians a day are not turning up for their routine pathology tests, as restrictions on movement, fear of coronavirus and a misperception that services are overwhelmed keep them away. Pathologists have reported a 40 per cent drop in the number of routine tests performed in recent weeks for conditions including cancer, diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, according to the Royal College of Pathologists Australasia. If these tests are skipped, their condition could deteriorate to the point that they need to be hospitalised, the college warned. GP  Allison Bielawski giving a flu shot to patient Lily Bardsley 24, at her practice in Glebe. Credit:James Brickwood Dr Debra Graves, CEO of the college said there was an assumption that routine tests and medical appointments were not happening because of health services being busy with COVID-19, or that it was not safe to go for a test when you need one. “We want to reassure Australians that pathology is still here providing the tests that you need every day. Your health is our priority,” Dr Graves said. Earlier this week Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy urged Australians not to ignore any other health issues they have during the coronavirus pandemic, saying some general practitioners are raising alarms over a sudden drop in patients and “a lot of people with chronic diseases” were not going to their check-ups. ""They're very worried that people are so frightened that they're not seeking medical attention,"" Professor Murphy said. “This is a very concerning issue … please don’t neglect general health conditions at the moment. That is a really important message."" Dr Graves also urged anyone with a chronic condition who needs regular pathology tests or anyone worried about symptoms they have developed to contact their GP and arrange a telehealth consultation if they can’t get to an appointment. ""We know that measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 will continue for some months and people need to continue looking after their health during this time,"" Dr Graves said. She said COVID-19 testing samples are generally only performed in designated locations, either at a dedicated site or a location separated from general pathology collection. “Pathology providers are experts in detecting infectious diseases ... This includes collection centres where strict hygiene, appropriate distancing and separation measures are in place,” Dr Graves said. Police have handed out almost 50 fines of $1000 for breaching social distancing restrictions in the last 24 hours, and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said any breaches of the rules will not be tolerated. “These people need to be sent a very clear message that it won't be tolerated, it won't be tolerated by the police or the community,” he said.“If you choose to go against what most people in the community think is a reasonable consideration with the situation that we're faced with COVID-19, police will take action.” Police last week speaking to a man who refused to leave Bondi Beach..Credit:Edwina Pickles From today, NSW Police are also able to issue a $5000 on-the-spot fine for spitting or coughing on health workers or police officers. “I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. He said the fine was unprecedented, but “it reflects the community disgust”. “It is absolutely disgusting to think that anybody would think it's OK to cough or spit on a police officer or a health worker at any time, let alone in the world's worst virus crisis for a hundred years,” Mr Hazzard said. “So, $5000, you should be very lucky, you're getting off lightly.” Mr Worboys gave a “big thank you” to people staying at home this Easter. But he added police would be out in force this long weekend, keeping their eyes peeled for people travelling away from home. “Right across country NSW, and, indeed, in and around the urban area here, police have been vigilant around people towing caravans, people with trailers and quad bikes and camping gear, people with surfboards,” he said. Mr Worboys said police near border towns were also on the lookout for vehicles with Queensland and Victorian licence plates “moving into the state for holiday activities”. “If you don’t have an excuse to travel you will be issued with a $1000 fine,” he said. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed a 69-year-old man has died at John Hunter Hospital in NSW overnight, raising the national coronavirus death toll to 53. One of NSW’s critically ill coronavirus patients is on ECMO, Mr Hazzard said. “ECMO, of course, is a higher level of need for the patient, extra corporeal oxygenation, making sure your organs are being oxygenated,” he said. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state has seen a “very modest” increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was “fantastic” the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys are providing an update on COVID-19.

The start of the Twenty20 tournament, originally scheduled for March 29, has been deferred to April 15 and another postponement looks inevitable as India locks down to prevent the spread of the virus. Pat Cummins expects the IPL to go ahead without crowds.Credit:Getty Images Cummins has good reason to want the IPL to get underway having attracted a bid of $US2.18 million ($3.4 million) from the Kolkata Knight Riders in the competition's annual auction, a record for a non-Indian player. The ICC Test player of the year, however, says getting the league underway would also be an important illustration of the world returning to normal after the pandemic. ""The first priority is safety but the second one is getting back to normality, finding that balance,"" the 26-year-old, named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year on Wednesday, told the BBC. ""If that unfortunately means no crowds for a while, then that is that, but hopefully people can watch at home on TV."" Cummins said playing the IPL behind closed doors would have a ""totally different feel about it"". ""When people ask about the difference between playing cricket in India the first thing is the crowd,"" he added. ""They scream every single ball whether it’s a six or a wicket - it's the same noise every ball - so that atmosphere is something that we love about playing in India. ""It will be missed in the short term if it can't happen, but I have no doubt it will be a great event even if it has to be played without crowds."" Cummins, who last bowled a ball in anger almost a month ago, faces a long wait for his next taste of international action after Australia's June test tour of Bangladesh was postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.

In a video broadcast on FFA's Twitter account for its new podcast,  Johnson says bluntly: ""It's all on the table."" FFA chief executive James Johnson says innovation is needed.Credit:AAP The CEO, who was appointed in  January, has had to grasp an unprecedented series of challenges in his short time in charge. His most immediate concern is the faltering relationship with Fox Sports, the league's broadcast partner, and whether the pay TV company will look to walk away from its $57 million-a-year deal to cover the sport if the A-League does not resume this season. But Johnson is looking beyond that and to the future, saying he is prepared to look at a major shake-up to the game's structure and operation if that is what is needed for it to flourish in the different world that sport and business will operate in when the COVID-19 crisis has passed. ""The message from me is we are not alone in some of the difficulties Australian football is facing,"" he said, citing the way that mega clubs such as Barcelona and Juventus have had to cut player wages and trim costs. ""I worked at FIFA and have gone through my fair share of crises there. ""The lesson I learned was when you are faced with challenges we need to look at opportunities."" The lack of international fixtures for the rest of the year presents him with an opportunity to suborn one of the country's most experienced coaches, national team boss Graham Arnold, to brainstorm ideas to safeguard the Australian game's future, he said. ""We know there will be no national team football in June and July, those windows will be pushed back to the end of the year.  I have asked Graham Arnold to work as a football advisor on football issues. ""We are going to get a whiteboard out and we will talk and debate about the real issues the game is facing, from transfer systems to pathways, to registration fees and competition structures. ""It's all on the table. ""This will help us develop points that we can then [promote] into the broad football community and that will help us develop a vision int the way forward."" As the game shuddered to a halt (the last A-League game was the closed-doors fixture between Newcastle and Melbourne City in March) there has been widespread debate throughout the soccer community as to how it can relaunch itself when a semblance of normality begins. Many see the enforced shutdown as a great opportunity to reset the entire sport, bringing in a second division and promotion and relegation.

He's also launched an email newsletter and began holding Zoom calls this week with individual supporters in what his campaign is calling a ""virtual ropeline"". Like much of the world, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is stuck at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But amid growing concerns that he's missing opportunities to build enthusiasm around his campaign for the White House, the former vice-president is stepping up his efforts to connect with voters. Joe Biden holds a virtual campaign event. The presumptive Democrat presidential nominee is reaching out to voters to keep the momentum up during the coronavirus pandemic.Credit:Getty Images ""We are trying to leave no channel unturned when it comes to where we put the VP and how we get the VP to engage with people,"" said Rob Flaherty, the Biden campaign's digital director. The pandemic has effectively frozen traditional campaigning, preventing Biden and President Donald Trump from the type of massive rallies that are a hallmark of presidential politics. In some ways, that's beneficial to Biden, who has struggled in large settings but is known for his ability to bond with voters in more intimate gatherings. Flaherty said the campaign started the Zoom calls to try to capitalise on Biden's strengths in individual conversations. Biden's team allotted 45 minutes for him to speak with eight supporters, but he ended up speaking to them for around 90 minutes. The recipients of his calls were a mix of volunteers, people who had emailed in their stories and others in touch with him or his campaign. They included a woman whose child was struggling with a stutter, something Biden himself has spoken openly about experiencing. The campaign is still deciding how to release video of the calls, but aides say they plan to hold similar events as long as social distancing guidelines are in place. Biden is adapting to the new virtual reality in other ways. He's holding fundraisers and press conferences online. His email newsletter includes campaign updates along with music suggestions, reading lists and answers to questions submitted by voters. Democratic presidential candidate former vice-president Joe Biden wishes supporter Barbara Moroney a happy 80th birthday on the phone in February.Credit:AP In the podcasts, he recently interviewed Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and the Obama administration's point person during the Ebola outbreak. In some respects, the moves simply bring Biden up to speed on tactics his former rivals deployed during the Democratic primary. Replay   Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren encouraged small-dollar donors by surprising them with impromptu phone calls that were later posted on social media. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who exited the race this week, has had a podcast and a campaign newsletter and released original content on YouTube. His livestreamed town hall meetings and addresses drew millions of views online. Biden describes himself as a ""tactile politician"" and some virtual campaign offerings haven't seemed natural for him. During a Friday fundraiser, he was asked how he was adjusting to the new online-only world of campaigning. ""I'd much prefer to be out there shaking hands, looking at people, because what I find is that's when they tell you what's in their heart,"" he said. At 77, Biden is far from a digital native. He's told supporters he's the ""guy that, when something happens on my cellphone, I turn to one of my granddaughters and say, 'Can you help me out here?""' But he later added: ""I'm trying to learn."" Biden is becoming more fluid with online engagement. He held a livestreamed roundtable with first-responders and frontline nurses dealing with the coronavirus crisis, as well as a happy hour event with young voters, during which some of them drank beer. Biden, who doesn't drink alcohol, sipped Gatorade from a paper cup. And from a television studio recently built in his basement, Biden is doing more live media interviews, appearing on the Sunday shows along with programs like the US ABC's The View and late-night talk shows hosted by Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon. 'We need to create intimacy at a distance."" The goal is to get Biden's message out to new audiences, and to help him connect with voters, said Stefan Smith, who served as Pete Buttigieg's online engagement director. Replay   ""We need to invest in platforms that help us bridge the physical distance that COVID has forced between candidates and voters - we need to create intimacy at a distance,"" he said. ""And the vice president's digital strategy is trying to do that by putting him as close to voters as possible."" The launch of new formats is as much a necessity for the campaign as it is an opportunity, however, as Biden works to compete with the daily noise of White House briefings, live briefings from governors and a non-stop stream of breaking coronavirus news. The Biden camp says for the past three weeks ending last Sunday, they received 45 million views for their campaign-created video - including interviews, roundtables and other virtual events - across digital platforms. But he faces an uphill battle in competing with Trump's online army. The Trump campaign has launched its own livestreamed videos that feature the President's surrogates and air online daily at 8pm Eastern time. They typically receive more than 1 million views every night. The President himself racks up millions of views for his daily press briefings. He also occasionally calls in to Fox News, where he can speak to an audience of millions. ""I'm glad to see Joe Biden adapting to the new normal because it often feels like Donald Trump is manipulating his way to a second term,"" said Democratic strategist Andrew Feldman. Indeed, Biden himself acknowledged during the Friday fundraiser that he's had ""a lot of people who are supporters getting very worried,"" asking, ""Where's Joe?"" He said while he's gotten more comfortable online, ""you can't compete with the President."" ""That's the ultimate bully pulpit,"" Biden said. AP Copyright © 2020"," Alex,ra Jaffe ","April 10, 2020"

""When they need airway intervention immediately, to know whether they are positive or negative is essential for their management."" It means patients can be moved to either intensive care, a ward for COVID-19 patients or a ward treating other respiratory illnesses, improving their treatment and streamlining the process in emergency. The test was being rolled out in the hospital's emergency department on Friday, but for now it could be used only for seriously ill patients because of  limited stock and uncertainty around further supply, Associate Professor Cunningham said. ""The test was released in the US only last week and as you can imagine, the global demand for this test is enormous,"" he said. ""This is great at the moment. If we can continue to get the supplies, our acute-care physicians will be in a really good place."" Associate Professor Cunningham said while other facilities around the country were interested in the rapid test, the hospital jumped on it ""pretty quickly"" because of the number of COVID-19 patients they were receiving. ""With Bondi and Waverley hotspots, St Vincent's has been the major hospital to receive those cases. It's fair to say we've seen a lot of people coming through,"" he said. Replay   The rapid test is a nose swab, similar to the main method being used to test people for the virus. However, instead of the four-to six-hour turnaround, Associate Professor Cunningham said results could be available in as little as 45 minutes. It detects the viral antigen – the virus's RNA [its DNA] – and can pick up cases of COVID-19 within a day of that patient's infection. For now, it won't be used for every patient arriving at the hospital's emergency department with a cough or fever. ""The issue is because we're not getting the supply we need, clinicians are going to have to make some hard and fast rules about when they can use the test,"" he said. ""They're having to ration it."" Associate Professor Cunningham said if supply of the test improves it could be used for more people, including healthcare workers down the track.

""The test was released in the US only last week and as you can imagine, the global demand for this test is enormous,"" he said. ""This is great at the moment. If we can continue to get the supplies, our acute-care physicians will be in a really good place."" Associate Professor Cunningham said while other facilities around the country were interested in the rapid test, the hospital jumped on it ""pretty quickly"" because of the number of COVID-19 patients they were receiving. ""With Bondi and Waverley hotspots, St Vincent's has been the major hospital to receive those cases. It's fair to say we've seen a lot of people coming through,"" he said. Replay   The rapid test is a nose swab, similar to the main method being used to test people for the virus. However, instead of the four-to six-hour turnaround, Associate Professor Cunningham said results could be available in as little as 45 minutes. It detects the viral antigen – the virus's RNA [its DNA] – and can pick up cases of COVID-19 within a day of that patient's infection. For now, it won't be used for every patient arriving at the hospital's emergency department with a cough or fever. ""The issue is because we're not getting the supply we need, clinicians are going to have to make some hard and fast rules about when they can use the test,"" he said. ""They're having to ration it."" Associate Professor Cunningham said if supply of the test improves it could be used for more people, including healthcare workers down the track.

Border Force has confirmed a telephone conversation took place between the harbourmaster and one of its officers in the hours before the troubled cruise ship was due to dock on March 19. Replay   In a statement Border Force said: ""The ABF officer made internal enquiries and subsequently advised the NSW Port Authority that the vessel had been cleared by NSW Health."" But a senior NSW government source said there ""is no evidence to date that Border Force spoke to NSW Health immediately prior to giving approval to dock"". Sources with knowledge of official inquiries said the Border Force officer told the ports authority employee they were worried that as many as 140 ill passengers were on board. The officer stressed that a major concern was exposing Border Force employees to possible coronavirus, prompting the harbourmaster to offer to stop the ship at Bradley's Head. According to sources, the harbourmaster was told by the Border Force officer they needed to check with a supervisor but 15 minutes later, the officer called back and said the ship could dock. Border Force did not respond to questions about when NSW Health was contacted before the Ruby Princess docked. Investigators conducting inquiries on-board the Ruby Princess on Wednesday evening.Credit:NSW Police The Ruby Princess debacle began on March 19 when almost 2700 passengers were allowed to disembark at Circular Quay. Just hours later four cases of COVID-19 were confirmed. The latest figures from NSW Health show there 363 NSW passengers who have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 21 crew members. The figures nationally for passengers now top 650. The Ruby Princess is under a criminal investigation, being led by NSW homicide detectives. The ""hundred or so"" people on shore making the decisions that led to the fiasco will be the priority of the 30 specialist detectives seconded to the investigation known as Strike Force Bast. Police sources with direct knowledge of the investigation say they will look at the decision-making process before interviewing any passengers or crew. Clad in personal protective equipment, detectives on Wednesday night boarded the Ruby Princess docked at the secure facility at Port Kembla, seizing a number of items. Investigators boarded the boat at 7pm, then left in the early hours of the morning. They spent Thursday collating what they found and going through evidence. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said investigators boarded the ship under an order by the state coroner. He said investigators had spoken to the ship's captain who was ""extremely helpful"". ""Ships have a black box very similar to that of international planes and that and other evidence has been seized for further investigation,"" Mr Fuller said. Mr Fuller said more than 1000 crew remain on the ship, and three-quarters want to stay on board. ""They feel safe on the ship, and I think that's a good outcome.""

35,/national/coronavirus-clusters-pervade-australian-hospital-wards-20200409-p54ip4.html,Coronavirus clusters pervade Australian hospital wards,"Coronavirus clusters are blooming within several Australian hospitals, as the virus spreads between staff, patients and their visitors from untraceable sources. Undetected coronavirus cases have infiltrated wards and units in NSW, Victoria and Tasmania, sending hundreds of exposed healthcare workers into quarantine, as staff and patients report lax policing of screening and distancing rules within some facilities. Replay   Australia's coronavirus death toll sits at 51, with total number of confirmed cases climbing to 6089 on Thursday. However, the rate of new cases continues to decline under the government's social distancing and isolation measures. NSW accounts for 2773 confirmed cases – 39 new transmissions in the 24 hours up to 8pm on Wednesday night, the lowest number since March 16. Ahead of the Easter long weekend, Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged the public ""not to leave your home unless you absolutely have to"". A cluster of 12 coronavirus cases at Gosford Hospital was among 416 coronavirus transmissions that NSW health authorities have not been able to trace back to their source. The first case was detected on March 27. Within two weeks, two elderly patients, four family members and six nurses and doctors had tested positive for coronavirus. Several more staff were sent home to self-isolate as NSW Health authorities traced the contacts of the confirmed cases to identify anyone who may have come into contact with them while they were infectious. The affected ward has since been designated a dedicated COVID-19 unit for low-risk patients. Both patients in the hospital cluster have been isolated in single patient rooms and were recovering well, chief executive of Central Coast Local Health District Dr Andrew Montague said. Dr Montague said the health district had taken several precautions to prevent the spread of the virus within its hospitals, including splitting emergency departments into general and high-risk ""red"" COVID sections to separate patients with respiratory symptoms, screening staff before each shift and restricting visitors to one person per patient per visit. Staff wearing face masks outside the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPA) in Camperdown, Sydney.Credit:AAP Similar protocols have been introduced to all public hospitals, but the undetected community transmissions that have become the overriding concern for all state and territory governments are still finding ways inside. A cluster of 23 COVID-19 cases in Tasmania's North West Regional Hospital – including 15 staff and five patients, and one discharged patient – accounts for more than one-fifth of the state's 107 confirmed coronavirus cases. Another 60 staff have been told to self-isolate. In Melbourne's The Alfred Hospital, a cluster of at least 15 cases – including five cancer patients (three of whom died) and 10 staff – knocked out more than 100 healthcare workers who had to self-isolate for 14 days. Last week the Herald reported two radiation therapists at Westmead Hospital tested positive for coronavirus, prompting two cancer patients and roughly 20 radiation oncology staff to self-isolate. Ryde Hospital was the nucleus of Australia's first cluster, that spread between the north-west hospital, the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility, two high schools, defence personnel and had links to a case at Liverpool Hospital. Up to 200 staff across Liverpool and Ryde hospitals were quarantined for 14 days as a result. The risk of clusters within hospitals is not unique to Australia. Major clusters in parts of the US and Europe have been traced back to hospitals. In March, Vietnam locked down one of its major hospitals after the country's biggest cluster of 16 people was linked to the facility. Healthcare workers have been identified as a high risk group for exposure to the virus. On Wednesday night, NSW Health revealed 127 confirmed cases in the state were healthcare workers during a teleconference with Australian Medical Association NSW members, though not all had contracted the virus at work. But healthcare workers, patients and visitors in Sydney and Melbourne have said protocols designed to limit exposure in hospitals were not uniformly enforced. Several clinicians in NSW, Queensland and Victoria have documented hand sanitiser that was zip-tied to dispensers being cut free and stolen. Signs indicating that patients are allowed only one designated visitor are ignored, with up to four family members gathering at the bedside of older patients. There was no adherence to social distancing within hospital wards, between patients and visitors, as well as staff conferring at nurses stations. Staff have repeatedly raised concerns over official guidelines that restrict the use of masks and other personal protective equipment. An AMA NSW survey of trainee doctors found one-third had witnessed colleagues hoarding personal protective equipment.

Bitter disputes have broken out across the sector as thousands of residents plan a rent strike and owners fear they will lose thousands of dollars in rent, with no government guarantees to ensure repayment when the economy comes out the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Sydney business owner Kyara Coakes outside the warehouse for her property-styling business. Credit:James Brickwood Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar has called for at least a 50 per cent waiver of all rent for businesses in financial distress, warning they will be saddled with debt if they come out of hibernation without some of their rent dismissed altogether. But landlords say they are being forced to act as guarantors for businesses and would have no way of recouping deferred rent payments if their tenants went bankrupt during the crisis. On Tuesday morning, a neighbour alerted property stylist Kyara Coakes her landlord was out the front of her Chatswood business. Her rent was three days late. She had asked for a pause in her $7000-a-month repayments as her revenue dropped 90 per cent when house inspection after house inspection was cancelled.

Bitter disputes have broken out across the sector as thousands of residents plan a rent strike and owners fear they will lose thousands of dollars in rent, with no government guarantees to ensure repayment when the economy comes out the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Sydney business owner Kyara Coakes outside the warehouse for her property-styling business. Credit:James Brickwood Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar has called for at least a 50 per cent waiver of all rent for businesses in financial distress, warning they will be saddled with debt if they come out of hibernation without some of their rent dismissed altogether. But landlords say they are being forced to act as guarantors for businesses and would have no way of recouping deferred rent payments if their tenants went bankrupt during the crisis. On Tuesday morning, a neighbour alerted property stylist Kyara Coakes her landlord was out the front of her Chatswood business. Her rent was three days late. She had asked for a pause in her $7000-a-month repayments as her revenue dropped 90 per cent when house inspection after house inspection was cancelled.

Although tough measures imposed on the public by governments to halt the spread of COVID-19 are broadly supported, about two in five Australians say they are making life “very difficult”, with young people and those living in the inner suburbs finding them the hardest to deal with. Australians are struggling with the impact of physical distancing restrictions on their lives. Credit:Peter Rae Newgate Research's weekly tracking study of more than 1000 Australians, taken between Monday and Wednesday, has found people are struggling most with the lack of social interaction, impacts on their income, having to stay at home and being unable to exercise like they usually would. Community alarm about coronavirus remains very high although it has dipped for the first time in the five surveys conducted since the start of March, with 63 per cent “extremely concerned” about it, compared to 74 per cent last week. This easing of concern is mostly being driven by a growing belief the spread of the virus is being brought under control and it will get better over the next few months. More than a quarter of respondents said having no social interactions or not being able to see family members have been the most difficult changes to deal with, while almost one in four Australians (24 per cent) found losing their job or an income source were the biggest challenges. The survey found the current economic impacts continue to bite despite a dip in the overall level of concern, with around two thirds of Australians now spending less money than they usually do, while 43 per cent have had their income reduced. One in five respondents say they have been laid off however there was been a slight drop in concern about job security, with 67 per cent now ""extremely"" or ""quite"" concerned, compared to 71 per cent last week. Replay   Newgate Research managing director Sue Vercoe said for now most Australians were continuing to follow instructions in relation to social distancing, with nearly nine in 10 avoiding all non-essential contact, avoiding shaking hands and staying at home. Ms Vercoe said despite a significant level of hardship there was continued confidence in Australia's leaders as well as the health system and other institutions managing and responding to the crisis. The survey found there had also been another significant increase in the proportion who believe Australia is responding appropriately to coronavirus, 66 per cent up from 56 per cent last week, taking it to the highest point so far. ""Australians’ advice to government and business leaders this week is to continue to take tough measures to stop the spread of the virus,"" Ms Vercoe said.

49,/business/the-economy/sudden-black-hole-the-us-economy-is-cratering-at-astonishing-speed-20200410-p54ist.html,‘Sudden black hole’: The US economy is cratering at astonishing speed,"Another 6.6 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week as the coronavirus outbreak continued its devastating march through the US economy, the Labor Department reported. With astonishing swiftness, the pandemic has shut down both long-standing and new businesses, leaving veteran workers and recent hires in nearly every type of industry without a pay cheque. In just three weeks, more than 16 million US workers have lost their jobs — more losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The US economy has been paralysed by the coronavirus.Credit:AP It's as if ""the economy as a whole has fallen into some sudden black hole,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics. Many Wall Street analysts concede that at this point, forecasts are not much more than guesses: The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted. Given the current information, though, several economists expect that by the end of the month more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work, pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 per cent. In February, it was 3.5 per cent, a result of 113 straight months of job growth. The country's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the goods and services produced, could fall this quarter at an annual rate of as much as 35 per cent from the preceding three months. It is clear that this quarter will be ""really terrible,"" Bostjancic said. ""We just don't know the degree of terribleness."" The weekly tally of people filing claims is one of the best measures of the virus' effect on the labour force, but it does not capture the full extent of the joblessness. Despite feverish efforts in many states to expand staffing and upgrade technological capacity, unemployment offices have been vastly overpowered by demand. Applicants in several of the hardest-hit places, like New York and California, say they've made dozens of attempts — even hundreds — to get through online or by telephone. Some have still not succeeded. In addition, directives to stay at home took effect only last week in many states. Florida and Texas, which together account for 15 per cent of the nation's payrolls, decided midweek to close nonessential businesses. As a result, the spike in claims in those states may not show up in the Labor Department's report until next week. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted Kendall Clark, an information technology recruiter said she had not managed to file despite more than 1200 attempts, some at 1am. ""For now, I don't really know what else to do,"" said Clark, who lives with her husband and two sons. ""I'm stuck, I'm frustrated, and I don't really know where to go from here. ""The plan is that we don't pay some bills but pay the mortgage so we don't lose the house,"" she said. Although each state sets the level and duration of its unemployment benefits, the federal $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) emergency relief act passed two weeks ago expanded the program, widening eligibility and extending the period for compensation. Virtually no industry has been immune to job cuts.Credit:Bloomberg Those payments will be crucial in helping families survive the crisis, said Robert G. Valletta, senior vice president and associate director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""It's exactly the kind of bridge that we need to make sure people are able to maintain some level of household stability and come out of this without complete devastation,"" he said.   Getting money immediately into the hands of people who need it not only helps households buy groceries and pay rent during an acute crisis but also aids in the economy's recovery. ""That helps to keep establishments open and running,"" said Cathy Barrera, founding economist of the Prysm Group, and that could help prevent a short, sharp shock from turning into a prolonged slump after the epidemic ebbs. The government's relief package — which includes low-interest loans and grants for businesses, ready cash for individuals and expanded unemployment insurance — was enacted with that goal in mind. Individuals should soon start receiving $US1200 emergency assistance checks. But Barrera worries that the expanded unemployment benefits won't come through rapidly enough. ""I am concerned that the way this relief has been channelled through the existing unemployment insurance system — which can be difficult to access in an expedient way — can be causing us some problems,"" she said. Several states, including Connecticut, have warned that cheques could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others, like Florida, start benefits only when a claim is filed, regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for example, allows workers who don't normally qualify — like independent contractors, part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others, Kandy Thomas, a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City, found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that ""these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the US Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs."" ""There's nothing for someone like me,"" Thomas said. ""As soon as you say you're self-employed, you're done."" Normally, most states offer roughly half of a worker's previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $US215, and just 9 per cent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $US550, and 57 per cent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $US600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks.

With astonishing swiftness, the pandemic has shut down both long-standing and new businesses, leaving veteran workers and recent hires in nearly every type of industry without a pay cheque. In just three weeks, more than 16 million US workers have lost their jobs — more losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The US economy has been paralysed by the coronavirus.Credit:AP It's as if ""the economy as a whole has fallen into some sudden black hole,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics. Many Wall Street analysts concede that at this point, forecasts are not much more than guesses: The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted. Given the current information, though, several economists expect that by the end of the month more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work, pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 per cent. In February, it was 3.5 per cent, a result of 113 straight months of job growth. The country's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the goods and services produced, could fall this quarter at an annual rate of as much as 35 per cent from the preceding three months. It is clear that this quarter will be ""really terrible,"" Bostjancic said. ""We just don't know the degree of terribleness."" The weekly tally of people filing claims is one of the best measures of the virus' effect on the labour force, but it does not capture the full extent of the joblessness. Despite feverish efforts in many states to expand staffing and upgrade technological capacity, unemployment offices have been vastly overpowered by demand. Applicants in several of the hardest-hit places, like New York and California, say they've made dozens of attempts — even hundreds — to get through online or by telephone. Some have still not succeeded. In addition, directives to stay at home took effect only last week in many states. Florida and Texas, which together account for 15 per cent of the nation's payrolls, decided midweek to close nonessential businesses. As a result, the spike in claims in those states may not show up in the Labor Department's report until next week. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted Kendall Clark, an information technology recruiter said she had not managed to file despite more than 1200 attempts, some at 1am. ""For now, I don't really know what else to do,"" said Clark, who lives with her husband and two sons. ""I'm stuck, I'm frustrated, and I don't really know where to go from here. ""The plan is that we don't pay some bills but pay the mortgage so we don't lose the house,"" she said. Although each state sets the level and duration of its unemployment benefits, the federal $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) emergency relief act passed two weeks ago expanded the program, widening eligibility and extending the period for compensation. Virtually no industry has been immune to job cuts.Credit:Bloomberg Those payments will be crucial in helping families survive the crisis, said Robert G. Valletta, senior vice president and associate director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""It's exactly the kind of bridge that we need to make sure people are able to maintain some level of household stability and come out of this without complete devastation,"" he said.   Getting money immediately into the hands of people who need it not only helps households buy groceries and pay rent during an acute crisis but also aids in the economy's recovery. ""That helps to keep establishments open and running,"" said Cathy Barrera, founding economist of the Prysm Group, and that could help prevent a short, sharp shock from turning into a prolonged slump after the epidemic ebbs. The government's relief package — which includes low-interest loans and grants for businesses, ready cash for individuals and expanded unemployment insurance — was enacted with that goal in mind. Individuals should soon start receiving $US1200 emergency assistance checks. But Barrera worries that the expanded unemployment benefits won't come through rapidly enough. ""I am concerned that the way this relief has been channelled through the existing unemployment insurance system — which can be difficult to access in an expedient way — can be causing us some problems,"" she said. Several states, including Connecticut, have warned that cheques could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others, like Florida, start benefits only when a claim is filed, regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for example, allows workers who don't normally qualify — like independent contractors, part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others, Kandy Thomas, a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City, found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that ""these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the US Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs."" ""There's nothing for someone like me,"" Thomas said. ""As soon as you say you're self-employed, you're done."" Normally, most states offer roughly half of a worker's previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $US215, and just 9 per cent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $US550, and 57 per cent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $US600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks. Workers in the country illegally and those newly entering the labor force remain ineligible. The New York Times Copyright © 2020"," Patricia Cohen , Tiffany Hsu ","April 10, 2020"

The company's first significant cut in A320-family output, to 40 jets a month, brings production to the lowest level since 2012 and will be implemented in May or June, unions said. Onlookers believe Airbus will have to cut more in the future. Credit:Bloomberg Airbus shares, which have fallen around 50 per cent this year due to the crisis, wobbled on Thursday but ended up 2 per cent as several analysts said the company had acted swiftly to reset output. But with all but a handful of airlines shunning deliveries as they hoard cash to survive the crisis, several industry officials and economists suggested the rate may be optimistic. ""We have too many planes,"" said Avitas senior vice-president Adam Pilarski, who has long warned of a jet market bubble - though nothing on the scale of the meltdown in air travel seen since quarantines rippled across the globe last month. Airlines are warning of $US252 billion ($398 billion) in lost revenues and 38 per cent lower traffic, many times higher than past corrections. With Boeing's competing 737 MAX still grounded after more than a year of safety reviews following two accidents, Airbus signalled on Wednesday that it was ready to act again if needed. ""It is a first step,"" said Rob Morris, chief consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, adding more reductions could be needed because of a large potential jet surplus. That contrasts with 2001 when Boeing cut output sharply after 9/11 attacks, while Airbus - reluctant then as now to cut output due to rigid European labour laws - spotted an opening with upstart budget carriers and went on a selling spree. The travel industry has been savaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:Getty Images One such carrier, easyJet, is now one of Airbus's top customers and says it is deferring deliveries. On Wednesday, Airbus was forced by the scale of the crisis to act as Boeing's 737 MAX remained grounded for safety reasons - having also played an unplanned role in curtailing supply that one source likened to a ""spent shock-absorber"". Airbus ""will have to share the (market) pain with Boeing,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said in a recent note. To defend its new output rate, experts said Airbus appeared to be banking on a sharp increase in retirements of older jets, echoing moves seen after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. Airlines have an incentive in bad times to idle jets early to avoid costly scheduled repair visits. But low oil prices like those seen today tend to push airlines in the other direction. According to Ascend by Cirium, the new Airbus target assumes every plane delivered this year will replace an older one being taken out of service. That suggests borrowing some demand from future years when some of those jets were due to be retired. Other tools used in past crises include pressure on leasing companies to take delivery. They place large speculative orders for good prices and are expected to pull their weight in a downturn - but they too are reeling as airlines hand back jets. Even so, market sources said, Airbus will need to make use of its relatively strong balance sheet to spur deliveries by providing finance to airlines or offering advances or discounts. Unlike in past downturns, the industry is currently facing a fundamental drop in demand everywhere, meaning there is little room for error if Airbus's output calculations go awry. ""Right now it looks like a tug of war between Airbus and airlines to see who should store some of those planes,"" an aircraft finance veteran said, asking not to be named.

The central bank announced programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses as the country tips into what economists say may be the worst recession in decades. It's the latest unprecedented move by the Fed, which has rushed to ensure cash gets to parts of the economy that need it after markets got snarled by a rush of investors pulling cash out of the system. For the week, the S&P 500 jumped 12.1 per cent, its best performance since late 1974.Credit:AP The stock market is not the economy, and that distinction has become even more clear this week. The S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent Thursday, the same day the government announced 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the nation. For the week, the S&P 500 jumped 12.1 per cent, its best performance since late 1974. Markets will be closed for Good Friday. Stock investors are continuously looking ahead to where the economy will be a few months or more in the future. From mid-February through late March, they sent stocks down by a third on expectations that a steep recession was imminent, before the economy really began to crunch. In the last few weeks, though, investors have sent the market back up more than 20 per cent following promises for massive aid from the Fed, other central banks and governments around the world, even as evidence piles up that the recession fears were prescient. This week, some investors have begun to look ahead to the economy possibly reopening amid signs the outbreak may be peaking or plateauing in several of the world's hardest hit areas. ""The market is solely focused on the number of cases,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""The question is when can the restrictions be lifted? That's what the market is focused on, when does America open up for business again?"" The S&P 500 rose 39.84 points to 2,789.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 285.80, or 1.2 per cent, to 23,719.37, and the Nasdaq climbed 62.67, or 0.8 per cent, to 8,153.58.. Many professional investors have been sceptical of the rally, saying there is still too much uncertainty. They say predictions for a relatively quick economic rebound are overly optimistic, and the head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday the global economy is set for its deepest recession since the Great Depression.. While hopes are building that a plateau may be arriving for infections in several hotspots, it's not assured. In the meantime, businesses continue to shut down and one in 10 U.S. workers has lost their jobs in the last three weeks. ""You typically have very strong rebounds, even in a bear market,"" Krosby said of markets where stocks have fallen more than 20 per cent. ""The question is whether or not we see selling into this rebound, or can we continue to build on it."" The market's big gains this week have been somewhat tentative. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 charged to an early 3.5 per cent gain before it disappeared in the final minutes of trading. On Thursday, the index nearly gave up all of an early 2.5 per cent gain, paring it down to 0.5 per cent before climbing again in the last hour of trading. Such volatility has become routine in markets at the end of each week recently. ""People are a little nervous to hold risk going into the weekend, especially a 72-hour weekend,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist with TD Ameritrade. The afternoon's fade also coincided with another abrupt downdraft in the price of oil. Benchmark US crude oil fell $US2.33, or 9.3 per cent, to settle at $US22.76 per barrel after being above $US28 earlier on speculation that big oil producers were set to announce a sharp cutback in production. Demand for energy has withered as economies shut down to slow the spread of the virus, and the world is awash in oil. Brent crude fell $US1.36, or 4.1 per cent, to $US31.48 per barrel. The Fed's immense programs announced Thursday touch far-reaching corners of lending markets, and if they continue for the long term, they could eventually lead to market bubbles. But in the short term, ""what the Fed is doing is great and helping markets function and providing liquidity so investors can do what they need (and) want to do,"" said Warren Pierson, deputy chief investment officer at Baird Advisors. The programs even include bonds for companies that have weak enough credit ratings to be called ""junk,"" or speculative grade. Worries have been high about the ballooning amount of corporate debt concentrated at the bottom edge of high-quality ""investment grade."" The looming recession could push a lot of that into ""junk"" status, which would force many investors to sell it because they're required to hold only investment-grade bonds. A run from such bonds could trigger sell-offs in other areas of the market and lead to even more pain across the economy. Also in the Fed's programs are municipal bonds, which allow cities and state governments to raise cash. On a normal day, trading in the market might see 15 buyers make a bid for a particular bond. But as recently as a few weeks ago, there were 15 sellers for every buyer, according to Gabe Diederich, portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management. All the difficulty in selling caused prices to tumble more than they otherwise should, even for high-quality bonds. That makes it more difficult for local governments to borrow.

Gorman, 61, started to feel sick in mid-March, he said. After getting tested and confirmed as having COVID-19, he self-isolated at home but did not stop leading regular calls with Morgan Stanley's operating committee and board of directors, nor did he experience severe symptoms, he said. Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman revealed the news in a 10-minute video to staff. Credit:Bloomberg His disclosure in a 10-minute video emailed to staff is one example of how and when financial firms are choosing to disclose sensitive health information during a global pandemic that has sickened half a million people, upended the global economy, and put banks at the centre of relief efforts for any potential recovery. The US Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to disclose material facts to the public, but there is widespread debate about when corporations must disclose information about the health of an executive, corporate governance lawyers said. Last month, Jefferies Financial Group Inc disclosed its chief financial officer, Peg Broadbent, died of complications related to the coronavirus. Perella Weinberg Partners LP founding partner Joseph Perella also tested positive for the coronavirus and recovered after treatment, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorised to discuss the information publicly. A spokeswoman said it is the firm's policy not comment on the health of its employees.

57,/world/europe/organised-effort-helping-drive-5g-virus-conspiracy-theory-online-20200410-p54isx.html,Organised effort helping drive 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory,"London: A conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the outbreak of the coronavirus is quickly gaining momentum, with celebrities including actor Woody Harrelson promoting the idea. But the theory is also getting a boost from what some researchers say is a coordinated disinformation campaign. Attendees are silhouetted beside a 5G display on the Deutsche Telekom exhibit in Berlin.Credit:Bloomberg Marc Owen Jones, a researcher at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar, who specialises in online disinformation networks, analysed 22,000 recent interactions on Twitter mentioning ""5G"" and ""corona"" and said he found a large number of accounts displaying what he termed ""inauthentic activity."" He said the effort bore some hallmarks of a state-backed campaign. ""There are very strong indications that some of these accounts are a disinformation operation,"" Jones said. Jones said the campaign used a strategy similar to that employed by Russia's Internet Research Agency, which was behind a disinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential campaign. But he said he hasn't yet concluded that Russia, or any other government or organisation, is behind the effort. Blackbird.AI, a New York-based company that monitors online disinformation campaigns, said it had in recent weeks identified a surge in the number of social media posts promoting the 5G conspiracy theory. In the previous 24 hours, there had been more than 50,000 posts about the topic on Twitter and Reddit, Naushad UzZaman, the company's chief technology officer and co-founder, said on Wednesday.

58,/world/europe/organised-effort-helping-drive-5g-virus-conspiracy-theory-online-20200410-p54isx.html,Organised effort helping drive 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory,"London: A conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the outbreak of the coronavirus is quickly gaining momentum, with celebrities including actor Woody Harrelson promoting the idea. But the theory is also getting a boost from what some researchers say is a coordinated disinformation campaign. Attendees are silhouetted beside a 5G display on the Deutsche Telekom exhibit in Berlin.Credit:Bloomberg Marc Owen Jones, a researcher at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar, who specialises in online disinformation networks, analysed 22,000 recent interactions on Twitter mentioning ""5G"" and ""corona"" and said he found a large number of accounts displaying what he termed ""inauthentic activity."" He said the effort bore some hallmarks of a state-backed campaign. ""There are very strong indications that some of these accounts are a disinformation operation,"" Jones said. Jones said the campaign used a strategy similar to that employed by Russia's Internet Research Agency, which was behind a disinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential campaign. But he said he hasn't yet concluded that Russia, or any other government or organisation, is behind the effort. Blackbird.AI, a New York-based company that monitors online disinformation campaigns, said it had in recent weeks identified a surge in the number of social media posts promoting the 5G conspiracy theory. In the previous 24 hours, there had been more than 50,000 posts about the topic on Twitter and Reddit, Naushad UzZaman, the company's chief technology officer and co-founder, said on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, religious leaders around the globe on Thursday urged people to celebrate Good Friday and Easter from the safety of their homes. Amid COVID-19 concerns, fast food worker Silay Penalosa wears a mask and Easter bunny ears as she carries an order to customer a waiting outside a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Dallas.Credit:AP Governments warned that the hard-won gains against the scourge must not be jeopardised by relaxing social distancing over the holiday weekend. Across Europe, where Easter is one of the busiest travel times of the year, authorities set up roadblocks and otherwise discouraged family gatherings. A spike in deaths in Britain and New York and surges of reported new infections in Japan and in India's congested cities made it clear the battle is far from over. In over developments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care after three days. The 55-year-old leader had taken a turn for the worse early this week. New York state reported 799 more dead, its third straight day of record-high fatalities. More than 7000 people have died in the state, accounting for almost half the US death toll of around 16,000. Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church is silhouetted against the rising sun in Kansas City, Missouri.Credit:AP ""That is so shocking and painful and breathtaking, I don't even have the words for it,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, though he added that there are hopeful signs, including slowdowns in the number of people being hospitalised and being admitted to intensive care. He said hospitals are standing up to the strain so far and the onslaught of patients has not been as big as feared. Worldwide, the number of dead rose past 90,000 and confirmed infections reached about 1.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed much higher, in part because of different rules for counting the dead and cover-ups by some governments. Numbers released on Thursday by the world's largest economy showed that 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that. That amounts to about 1 in 10 US workers, the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since record-keeping began in 1948. The real numbers could be even higher because state unemployment offices around the country have been overwhelmed with claims, and some people have been unable to get through by telephone or website. And still more job cuts are expected. The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent - a number last seen at the tail end of the Depression. Xian Chang, whose Cafe China and two other New York restaurants normally employ around 150 people, said only about 40 are working. One restaurant is closed, the others are offering takeout only, and workers aren't coming in, in some cases because they are sick or afraid. ""Frankly, we are losing money every day we're open,"" he said. Sharon Bridgeman, 57, of Kansas City, Missouri, was laid off from her job two weeks ago at a nonprofit that helps homeless people and is still waiting to be approved for unemployment benefits. ""I'm worried I may not have a job to go back to,"" she said. ""I'm also worried about the people I work with."" In the US, the Federal Reserve announced it will provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in loans targeted toward both households and businesses. In Europe, finance ministers from the 19-nation euro zone were set to make another attempt on Thursday to agree on measures to help the bloc weather the crisis. In many European countries, where the social safety nets tend to be stronger than in the US, government programs that subsidise workers' pay are keeping millions of people on payrolls in places like Germany and France, though typically with fewer hours and at lower wages. The United Nations' labour organisation said the equivalent of 195 million full- time jobs could be lost in the second quarter, while the aid organisation Oxfam International estimated half a billion people worldwide could be pushed into poverty if wealthier nations do not take urgent action. Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse, Japan, the world's third-largest economy, and France are all, like the US, either in a recession or feared headed for one. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top American infectious-diseases expert, shot down hopes that warmer spring weather would bring an end to the crisis. ""One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather,"" he said. ""You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing."" Amid widespread restrictions on public gatherings, major religious denominations are holding virtual services where members can watch on TV, online or on their phones. Others are holding services at drive-in theatres, where people can stay in their cars. Instead of Easter egg hunts, there are virtual events where children seek out hidden items on YouTube. The virus ""doesn't take a day off for Good Friday or Easter Sunday,"" said Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Still, other churches plan to move ahead with Easter, especially in states like Texas, where the governor declared religious gatherings ""essential services."" A Houston church has installed hand-washing stations and rearranged the 1000-person sanctuary to hold about 100 people with 6 or more feet between them. Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside. In England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video. The British government is running ads urging people to ""Stay Home, Save Lives"" over the weekend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised that ""even short trips inside Germany, to the seaside or the mountains or relatives, can't happen over Easter."" The Dutch prime minister said border crossings with Germany and Belgium could be closed if there is too much traffic. New Zealand police warned people not to drive to vacation homes over Easter and risk arrest. Greece also tightened restrictions ahead of next week's Orthodox Easter, increasing roadblocks, doubling fines for lockdown violations and banning travel between islands. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested mass gatherings may be barred through the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which runs from late April through most of May. Indonesia's president banned civil servants, police officers, military personnel and employees of state-owned companies from returning to their hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. New infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off in hard-hit Italy and Spain, which together have around 33,000 deaths, but the daily tolls are still shocking. Spain reported 683 more dead, bringing its total to more than 15,200. Britain recorded 881 new deaths, for a total of close to 8000. Japan recorded more than 500 new cases for the first time, a worrisome rise since it has the world's oldest population and COVID-19 can be especially serious in the elderly. For most, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms like fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia. About 350,000 people have recovered, by Johns Hopkins' count. AP Copyright © 2020", Michelle R. Smith ,"April 10, 2020"

The real numbers could be even higher because state unemployment offices around the country have been overwhelmed with claims, and some people have been unable to get through by telephone or website. And still more job cuts are expected. The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent - a number last seen at the tail end of the Depression. Xian Chang, whose Cafe China and two other New York restaurants normally employ around 150 people, said only about 40 are working. One restaurant is closed, the others are offering takeout only, and workers aren't coming in, in some cases because they are sick or afraid. ""Frankly, we are losing money every day we're open,"" he said. Sharon Bridgeman, 57, of Kansas City, Missouri, was laid off from her job two weeks ago at a nonprofit that helps homeless people and is still waiting to be approved for unemployment benefits. ""I'm worried I may not have a job to go back to,"" she said. ""I'm also worried about the people I work with."" In the US, the Federal Reserve announced it will provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in loans targeted toward both households and businesses. In Europe, finance ministers from the 19-nation euro zone were set to make another attempt on Thursday to agree on measures to help the bloc weather the crisis. In many European countries, where the social safety nets tend to be stronger than in the US, government programs that subsidise workers' pay are keeping millions of people on payrolls in places like Germany and France, though typically with fewer hours and at lower wages. The United Nations' labour organisation said the equivalent of 195 million full- time jobs could be lost in the second quarter, while the aid organisation Oxfam International estimated half a billion people worldwide could be pushed into poverty if wealthier nations do not take urgent action. Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse, Japan, the world's third-largest economy, and France are all, like the US, either in a recession or feared headed for one. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top American infectious-diseases expert, shot down hopes that warmer spring weather would bring an end to the crisis. ""One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather,"" he said. ""You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing."" Amid widespread restrictions on public gatherings, major religious denominations are holding virtual services where members can watch on TV, online or on their phones. Others are holding services at drive-in theatres, where people can stay in their cars. Instead of Easter egg hunts, there are virtual events where children seek out hidden items on YouTube. The virus ""doesn't take a day off for Good Friday or Easter Sunday,"" said Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Still, other churches plan to move ahead with Easter, especially in states like Texas, where the governor declared religious gatherings ""essential services."" A Houston church has installed hand-washing stations and rearranged the 1000-person sanctuary to hold about 100 people with 6 or more feet between them. Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside. In England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video. The British government is running ads urging people to ""Stay Home, Save Lives"" over the weekend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised that ""even short trips inside Germany, to the seaside or the mountains or relatives, can't happen over Easter."" The Dutch prime minister said border crossings with Germany and Belgium could be closed if there is too much traffic. New Zealand police warned people not to drive to vacation homes over Easter and risk arrest. Greece also tightened restrictions ahead of next week's Orthodox Easter, increasing roadblocks, doubling fines for lockdown violations and banning travel between islands. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested mass gatherings may be barred through the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which runs from late April through most of May. Indonesia's president banned civil servants, police officers, military personnel and employees of state-owned companies from returning to their hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. New infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off in hard-hit Italy and Spain, which together have around 33,000 deaths, but the daily tolls are still shocking. Spain reported 683 more dead, bringing its total to more than 15,200. Britain recorded 881 new deaths, for a total of close to 8000. Japan recorded more than 500 new cases for the first time, a worrisome rise since it has the world's oldest population and COVID-19 can be especially serious in the elderly. For most, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms like fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia. About 350,000 people have recovered, by Johns Hopkins' count. AP Copyright © 2020", Michelle R. Smith ,"April 10, 2020"

This morning, the frontline unfolded across my dining room table. My daughter took to home-schooling like a fish takes to the beach: just not her natural environment. She commenced with “no”, escalated to “never” and only conceded “this is fun” after I’d pulled half my hair out and threatened to film her having a tantrum and download it on the school distance-learning app on the basis that if technology can be used to torment me, I can use it to torment others. Lucy Robb Vujcic is a Sydney barrister and reluctant home-schooler. Since this morning, I have taught fractions, drawn pie charts with inconveniently numbered slices (can anyone actually divide a circle into equal sevenths, freehand?), mapped out a presentation on different number systems throughout history (during which I inadvertently taught myself how to use an abacus), went cross-eyed trying to appreciate my daughter’s PowerPoint presentation on tea bags (yes, tea bags, that was not a typo) and carded wool for a weaving project. My son was a wholly different challenge. At least some part of his DNA is shared with a Mexican jumping bean, so we leapt out of bed and tried to ward off the wiggles by a bicycle ride around the bay. My bicycle has one working gear (possibly gear 7 but it’s unclear), no suspension and brakes that are permanently engaged, so the Mexican jumping bean went faster than I did unless I absolutely floored it. Round we went, narrowly missing fat-bottomed ladies with earplugs in both ears, swinging their hips literally from one side of the bike track to the other like a gauntlet while I tried to drink coffee out of a sustainable go cup with a pop-top that spurted coffee at me. My T-shirt is no longer white. Then we tried his home-schooling, only to discover that 1600 other boys were on the same website and we could not access it. So. We spelled every word we could think of, found some maths homework we forgot about last week and then gave up and went for a walk. At which point my husband turned up. He gets away with saying he works in an essential service, which is somehow more essential than my service as a fulltime working barrister with jury trials to run. He took one look at my face and, contrary to all good sense, told me I was in an awful mood. Then he sat and fiddled with a 20-year-old rowing machine that he swung back and forth on for a while before announcing it needed new rubber. It will now live on my front deck like the rusted wreck it is, next to an old door that used to attach to the kids’ wardrobe. My husband took the door to the front gate for disposal some time ago (he says he knows where the tip is) and somehow never made it any further. Then I tried to work but my son was trying to take a piano lesson via Zoom at the same time. Nuff said. Then I tried to work but it was afternoon tea time. We had run out of milk (because you can only buy two items at the moment and my kids are capable of going though 22 litres of milk a week, which requires a lot of separate trips to the supermarket when you can’t buy in bulk). So out we went. And it rained. Then I tried to work again and one of my contact lenses fell out. Only one, mind you, so I could not justify cracking open a new lens and making my stock of lenses uneven, so I tried using the dictation program on Microsoft. Then my son started to listen to The BFG on Audible. Then I reviewed the document I was working on (or talking at, depending on your view of these things) and had to edit the word “frobscottle” out of every second paragraph. Extra points for those of you who know what frobscottle is – and no, it’s not the thing you want to do to your husband when he marches in and announces (again) that he is in an essential industry and that you are being really awful today.

Then it was dinner time – which sort of pounced on me unexpectedly because I thought I had only just accomplished afternoon tea. Then I got 42 separate emails from solicitors who needed something urgently. Most of which I eventually worked out were not urgent or had been urgent for some time but had been ignored until it was too late to fix. Then I got a reminder from my son’s school that he is expected to do his home-learning in his school uniform, ironed shirt, creased shorts, sock garters, school badge and all. Right. Then I discovered that my children had tipped something unrecognisable over their bedclothes so I had to change the sheets. Then I found my Navy mess shirt tangled at the bottom of my son’s duvet cover. I hadn’t noticed it was missing. All I can say is “thank frobscottle” that the annual Mess dinner has been cancelled due to coronavirus. Then my computer ran out of juice, so I lay on the floor and shut my eyes, since there did not appear to be anything else I could do at that point.

67,/national/nsw/for-those-ready-to-cast-blame-over-ruby-princess-consider-the-dianne-brimble-tragedy-20200407-p54hs4.html,"For those ready to cast blame over Ruby Princess, consider the Dianne Brimble tragedy","Death, a cruise ship, a homicide investigation. While the fateful events unfolded slowly and quietly in the cabins, passengers continued to party, enjoying their holiday of a lifetime and, until the end, the cruise company ensured it was business as usual, and life on board went on. While the scale of the disaster that is the Ruby Princess is far greater, and its global context unprecedented in modern times, there are striking similarities with another cruise ship death – that of Brisbane mother Dianne Brimble, who died alone in September 2002 on board the Pacific Sky. Dianne Brimble: A cruise ship tragedy that provides a cautionary tale about leaping to conclusions before a thorough investigation of the Ruby Princess case.  Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. Replay   That said, cruise companies are businesses. They know the basic rules of public relations: co-operate with the investigation, apologise, replace the chief executive, all in the hope it will allow survival long enough to start a new chapter. Cruise passenger numbers actually exploded after Brimble’s death, despite the negative publicity. Cruising will likely survive this crisis too. But it is certain there will be other deaths, diseases and tragedies on board cruise ships in the future.The international Cruise Victims Association, represented in Australia by Mark Brimble, Dianne’s former husband, issued a recent statement about the coronavirus crisis six days before the Ruby Princess disembarked its passengers in Sydney. It called on the cruise industry to ""cease the practice of business as usual"" and to suspend its operations in US ports, citing data on the industry’s deficiency in controlling viral outbreaks on ships. “This situation will not be remedied by continuing business as usual,” the ICV said. Hopefully, that’s where the similarities between these two tragedies end, and this police investigation will result in change that disrupts the ""business as usual"" attitude in cruising.

There is a limit to how much the government can borrow to deal with the economic challenges. A simple non-budget solution would be to legislate so that for the next six months every salary and wage earner in Australia may choose to take their compulsory 9.5 per cent superannuation contribution in their pay packet. Compulsory contributions will automatically return to normal at the expiration of the legislation unless otherwise approved by Parliament. The nation must decide its best path forward: People lining up at a Centrelink office amid the COVID-19 shock.Credit:Getty Images That is equivalent to a 9.5 per cent overnight increase in pay available to every working Australian. An increase on which they will pay tax according to their tax bracket. There is no cost to government and, in fact, an increase in income tax revenue. There is no cost to business, which is important as many businesses are struggling to survive. Theoretically the Australian annual GDP is approximately $2 trillion ($1.89 trillion in 2019) and wages and salaries are approximately 55 per cent of that - say $1 trillion a year. A 9.5 per cent increase is worth approximately $100 billion a year. Last year super contributions totalled $120 billion. Assuming conservatively that 50 per cent choose to keep paying into their super, that is an instant $50 billion to $60 billion per year increase in overall pay. This would be a much needed boost to a dissolving economy and just as importantly would give a lift to consumer and business confidence. The super funds have $3 trillion under management. I understand that this could cause some short-term liquidity problems for the funds and in particular for the smaller funds. This is a better solution than eating into existing super balances at a time of depressed asset values. The Reserve Bank could establish a facility to help with any short-term liquidity problems. Given that compulsory contributions would commence again in six months, the funds are eminently bankable. The super funds are a major portion of our savings pool. This is not a proposal to dip into the existing pool. It is a proposal to temporarily reduce the growth of the pool at a time of great economic and social distress. Most of business is suffering and are playing their part in keeping things going. It is not unreasonable to ask the super funds who have a rare, privileged position in our economy to make a short-term contribution. It is, after all, the members' money and they should have the opportunity to decide how they use it over a defined short period in these strained times. I never thought I would see the day when average hard-working Australians were lining up at Centrelink. Our focus must be on keeping the economy going, helping the many who are suffering and then speeding up the recovery. An injection of $50 billion to $60 billion per annum or more into wages satisfies all three criteria without adding further to the growing deficit. Super is for a rainy day but we are in a cyclone. This is the people’s money and their future. It is a time for reality and not a time for paternalism.

The spare toothbrush sitting on the vanity basin that I could easily return to a drawer. The half dozen Matchbox cars that I should just put back with the others in a box in the spare wardrobe. The plastic container of pine nuts that she pointed to, up in a cupboard , thinking they were Rice Bubbles. Joan Brown in pre-lockdown days with her  great- granddaughter, Abbie. 
 Yes, all the things that were part and parcel of a visit, when my 2½-year-old great-granddaughter  would in equal measure bamboozle and delight me. How could such a small human being create such a mess in such a short time? How could she melt my heart with a soulful glance in my direction? How could she absolutely love bananas one day, and later recoil in horror if offered one? When she was old enough, I brought out the toys kept from my own children’s young days. Thesturdy wooden blocks that my granddaughter, her mother, used to set out as a giant shoppingcentre, all over the family room floor, and then drive and park the Matchbox cars that had passed down the generations. This young firebrand was just as likely to throw a car onto the blocks. At lunchtime, there was a chair which was indisputably hers. There had to be cutlery, even if the food was easily picked up. At least she eventually learned not to turn the loaded spoon over just before it entered her mouth. Then, she would lead me into the bathroom to get her toothbrush out of the drawer and wait for me to add a squeeze of toothpaste. Several refills were deemed necessary before the job was finished. It was only by good fortune that I stopped her once from squeezing some heat rash cream from a similar tube. Now, of course, these visits have ceased, courtesy of COVID-19. I’m one of those people classed as vulnerable, confined to the house, and even when other family members call in, we keep our distance. There is no way a toddler can comprehend the idea of social distancing, of not lunging onto whoever is comfortably seated. Safer if she and her mother just don’t come. When I saw her last, I was returning from a quick visit to Melbourne, and she was brought out to meet me at the airport. As I entered the terminal, she raced across and embraced my legs, calling me by the name we had chosen, Jojo. Even at that stage, three weeks into March, I didn’t pick her up and cuddle her. Things had changed quickly in the five days I was away. “ You’ve got to go onto Facebook, Mum. That way at least you can see her.” And so I reluctantly agreed. There’s only been one occasion so far, partly because it’s a bit difficult to learn how to use this system when the person giving me the instructions can’t stand or crouch close enough to show me. She and her mummy came up on the screen, saw me and said, “Look! Jojo!” Her face lit up, she smiled her big toothy grin. But it’s not the same. The other day I found a plastic block that had escaped being put away with the others. I did restore it to its rightful place, and must do the same with the toothbrush and the toy cars. “On the other side”, as we are constantly reminded, things will return to normal and once again there’ll be those delightful, hair-raising, messy, laughter-inducing visits.

70,/national/stop-looking-for-loopholes-what-are-the-new-covid-19-social-rules-20200407-p54hyd.html,'Stop looking for loopholes': What are the new COVID-19 social rules?,"Guests are pinged for being at a dinner party. Five young people in a car are fined for driving around aimlessly together. Three friends are fined for playing video games in a loungeroom. All had breached laws aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. In our new reality during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter where you live in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised there are really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Bottom line: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care,"" as federal government text messages are saying. Sound a bit full-on? So are the potential consequences of getting COVID-19. The idea of these rules is to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus by limiting contact with others, thereby flattening the rate of infections and ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed. So far, Australians have been doing a good job of following the rules. The number of new infections recorded every day is falling. But our medical experts have warned now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"" – complacency could see Australia lose its window to contain the outbreak, and cases rapidly explode again. Replay   As questions from you flood into police, governments – and our newsrooms – about what will and won't get you fined on the spot, we've scoured guidelines and public comments from leaders, and put your questions to governments and the police. Here is what we know so far. In all states, you can still visit someone in an emergency or to provide care – or even drop off supplies. But when it comes to social visits to households, it's the unnecessary guests that are now advised against, even if you live alone. Spending time together inside a house, as opposed to on a walk outside (1.5 metres apart), gives the virus more opportunities to spread in bathrooms and kitchens. Victoria has taken one of the tougher lines on guests - banning all non-essential, social visits to homes even between relatives. Premier Daniel Andrews has spoken of a recent dinner party in Victoria at which one person was infected with COVID-19 at the start and several guests had come down with the new illness by the end. In NSW, the position is similar. There are 16 excuses for leaving your home but none of them involve dinner parties, barbecues or beers with mates (see the list below). In Queensland, social visits are allowed for up to two visitors to each household, although strangers can't visit. Tasmania and the ACT still also let you have up to two visitors as long as you are following social distancing measures – allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In WA, social visits are strongly discouraged but not banned outright. (We are still seeking clarification on this.) In South Australia and the Northern Territory, socialising is discouraged but gatherings are limited to 10. Here's something else to bear in mind when deciding what to do: people over 70 and people with a chronic illness, including common conditions such as high blood pressure, are particularly susceptible to complications, even death, from the virus. Every visit brings with it the chance of infection, and some carriers are asymptomatic too – you may not know you are carrying the virus. This was briefly a vexed issue in Victoria and NSW because social visits are otherwise banned. Victoria quickly backed down on its ""bonk ban"", after advising on April 1 that people should not visit or be intimate with partners they didn't live with. Within hours, it had made a specific exemption for romantic couples. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route: he said visiting a partner fell under the category of ""care"", which is one of the 16 reasonable excuses (listed above) for not staying home. ""Mental health,"" he said, ""we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you."" In the other states and territories, visitors can include partners. People can visit as carer.Credit:  While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear – although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. In NSW, the government has yet to clarify this. Victoria has said its own rules allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. 'It’s not smart and it’s not right,' said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews about grandparents babysitting. Still, older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia's chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of the case of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit. Yes, but only if it's essential (this is no time for a backyard blitz) and while keeping your distance. In NSW, as we've seen above, cleaning will fall under caring when it's for someone vulnerable. In Victoria, if you are unwell, disabled, elderly or pregnant you can have a service provider or tradie over ""if you really need help"". ""For example,"" the government advice says, ""your Wi-Fi might be faulty and you need it to work from home. Or, you might have a leaking pipe causing damage. A tradesperson is permitted to enter your home to fix the problem, but you must ensure physical distancing while they are there."" Similarly, house cleaners are framed in the guidelines as being for those who need help, physically. If you're helping an elderly friend or relative who lives alone with cleaning and housework, the government advises, think about having them sit somewhere comfortable and away from you while you work. For the rest of us, it might be time to dust off the feather duster. In Queensland, the limit of two visitors is not affected by someone who's at the house to work (for example, a cleaner, a nanny or tradesperson), according to guidelines. ""This means for example, three tradespeople could be at your house to do repairs, and you can still have a close friend at your house, with your regular household members."" Safe Work Australia is advising cleaners and tradespeople to maintain physical distance at all times in homes. No mucking around! Make beach visits quick and for exercise. And check whether a beach is open before you head out.Credit:  Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has kept going for morning walks every day during the crisis. Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has mentioned taking a 20-minute evening constitutional around his neighbourhood. As the Prime Minister has said, exercise is one of the four acceptable reasons to be out of your home. Exercise can be with one other person so long as you keep 1.5 metres distance from one another. While group boot camps are out, you can walk, jog, cycle or do push-ups with your household or someone external, including a personal trainer, as long as it's just the two of you. You could even grab a takeaway coffee but, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged, keep moving – the aim is to avoid people clustering together, and NSW Police have stressed that people hanging about will attract their attraction. Note that the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services has said: ""Recreational exercise such as fishing, hunting, boating, golf and other activities that go beyond basic exercise, are not allowed."" If you keep the word ""essential"" in mind, then rambling Sunday drives or road trips where you pop out of the car right at the end to stretch your legs are not on right now. In fact, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has told ABC Radio the Easter long weekend is not an excuse for people to travel just anywhere and people should not be going for a drive – even if they have no intention of getting out of the car. In Victoria, Police Minister Lisa Neville has urged people to exercise in their local community and not travel to the coast for a surf, walk or swim even if a beach is open. Surfing, swimming and walking are all permitted on beaches but, while driving the 20 minutes from Aireys Inlet to Lorne would be reasonable, driving the two hours from Melbourne to Lorne would be ""inappropriate"".  Police rescinded a fine for a man who was driving half-an-hour to go mountain biking alone – at the nearest track to his home. Driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable. (Given the two-person rule, you could conceivably meet someone from another household at your destination but you should not drive there together.) In Queensland, those considering travelling to walk on a beach should think again: beaches are accessible only to people who live in the immediate area, with police signalling they will step up random ID checks over the Easter weekend. People are not allowed to travel, for example, from Brisbane to the Gold Coast to visit the beach, and will be fined if police do spot checks. Border controls are in force in Queensland too and more than 900 cars had been turned around by April 8. Within WA too, if you drive far enough, you might come up against one of the around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among the state's nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down for all but essential services. See details below. L-platers: depends where you live.Credit:  That depends on where you live. NSW Police have issued a statement saying learning to drive with a household member is considered a reasonable excuse to leave home ""given that this is a learning activity that cannot be done from home and is akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Victoria has come down differently on the issue. A learner driver made news recently after she was fined $1652 for practising driving with her mother, which police said was ""non-essential"". Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton later acknowledged this was not a fair fine because the rules were unclear and there was no precedent. But Victorian authorities stand by the fact that a driving lesson is not essential, and Patton has said any future cases will be fined. An L-plater can drive for essential activities, such as buying food or for medical care. In Queensland, the Chief Health Officer's direction is to only undertake essential travel. So, again, you could supervise your child driving to and from these essential activities. The WA government is recommending all learner driver lessons, outside essential travel, also be deferred for now but the transport department is ""prioritising driving tests for emergency services and personnel and for heavy vehicles to keep the freight industry operating"". Easter holidays? Stay home. Credit:  Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"". An influx of visitors to holiday spots exposes communities in those areas to infection and could strain local medical services if someone becomes ill. In Victoria, Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton has said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for food and other essentials; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. In NSW, taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse to be moving about. A man told 3AW radio on April 7 he had received a $1652 fine for non-essential travel after visiting his beach house on the Mornington Peninsula to check its security. ""I went down by myself. On the way home, I thought, I'll make a little detour and get rid of an empty gas bottle …"" he said. Towing a caravan and setting it up somewhere is also out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental. ""You should be cancelling your booking for the Easter weekend. If you've booked an Airbnb, you should be staying home in your permanent residence,"" Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said. Airbnb have cancellation policies in place that allow you to cancel and get a full refund if you booked before March 14.  In NSW, the public health orders specifically spell it out: ""Taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse."" And NSW Police have explicitly said not to go on holidays. They've even revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. Short-term rentals such as Air BnBs can be used for work, education or for caring purposes but not for holidaying. In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, ""Easter holidays are cancelled this year"". Queensland police have strongly suggested they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. If you are able to make a convincing case that your travel is for essential purposes, such as for work, that might be fine but if the ""work"" is simply mowing the yard or so on then it is not advisable. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. You couldn't travel from Perth to a holiday home in, say, Dunsborough, in the South West region, unless you were an essential worker or travelling on compassionate grounds. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. While you can't go to church, some Easter services are being broadcast on television and some are being ""live-streamed"", which means you can watch them on your computer broadcast in real time. Of course, there won't be any parishioners, just the priest and whoever is needed to film the service. Search online for details. Yes if you have to. You can even have removalists but you must adhere to physical distancing rules. You bet. In every state and territory, blood donations are exempt from the current restrictions. Fishing? It depends where you live.Credit:  ""No one likes playing golf more than I do,"" Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said. ""You might want to play golf but you don't need to play golf. No round of golf is worth someone's life."" Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has ruled out not just golf but fishing, boating, hunting, camping and ""all recreational activity beyond basic exercise"". ""Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your [golf] clubs at home."" In NSW, hunting is suspended but fishing is OK – the Department of Primary Industries characterises it as exercise. Golf is fine, too. (Golf courses were initially closed on advice of the federal government but, after reconsideration, the NSW Office of Sport deemed golf an activity that can be played in line with Public Health Orders.) And so is boating. A ""reasonable excuse"" to use your boat could be to exercise (for example, kayaking, sailing, paddling); fish; get to and from work when you can't work from home; get groceries; and provide help or care to an immediate member of the person's family. Again, social distancing rules always apply – at the boat ramp and on your boat. You should be in your boat alone or with just one other person; or with family who ordinarily live in the same household as you. In Queensland, even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. Golf is good in Queensland as long as it is with just two people who are physically distant. Boating was banned but now boaties can locally fish or travel for food but not recreation (it's not clear where this leaves anglers). Other forms of water sports, including kayaking and paddleboarding, are also still allowed in Queensland, and state-run boat ramps remain open. Even so, the federal provisions limiting public gatherings to two people or less still apply, and even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. WA has not expressly banned recreational fishing or boating but fishers have been encouraged to stay at home and recreational fishing body Recfishwest says you should head out only for essential food gathering. Golf is OK, though. Some clubs are open and some have opted to shut. You have to play in a one or a two, physically distancing as you go, and call the club first, both to see if they're open and to get an allocated tee-time. The ACT has banned all outdoor recreation beyond exercise as non-essential. You can do these things, if it's essential or for compassionate reasons (say, you physically cannot wash and style your own hair) but governments strongly urge people aged 70 or over, or 60 with chronic medical conditions, to avoid contact because they are at higher risk of complications or death from COVID-19. So, while banks and hairdressers are deemed essential services and remain open, it's better if you speak to your bank over the telephone and see how they can assist you; or potentially request that a hairdresser visit you at home; or find a relative, carer or support person who can help you. Now is the time to prevail on others. You can phone the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 for more information. Victoria's Council on the Ageing has a phone hotline from 9.30am until 4pm on 1300 135 090. In Queensland, the Community Recovery Hotline, a free call on 1800 173 349, will link seniors and other vulnerable Queenslanders to essential services and support. If you want to talk through how you are feeling and gain advice and support to suit your circumstances, phone Beyond Blue's new Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Service on 1800 512 348. WA Police have set up around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among WA’s nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down, meaning any person who is outside the region can only enter if: People who cross into another region without valid reasons could face a $50,000 fine. A hard state border closure is also in force. Anyone seeking to come into WA will now be turned away unless they have a valid exemption. Who is exempt from the border closure?  There will also be exemptions for fly-in-fly-out workers and their families but strict 14-day quarantine measures will need to be followed, paid for by the industry. So anyone travelling from interstate or overseas will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, and anyone who does not adhere to this law can be prosecuted.   People in WA will be allowed through road blocks if they want to donate blood. It is exempt from the current restrictions in all states and territories. Road blocks are set up across the nine regions of WA.Credit:  As of April 7, NSW Police have issued 122 personal infringement notices under the Public Health Act since March 17. Among the latest was an off-duty policewoman who was observed allegedly drunk on a city street being assisted by a man. She later told police she had been at a nearby apartment with others including another off-duty policeman. Five people in total were issued infringement notices resulting from the incident. In Victoria, police have issued more than 600 fines for breaches of coronavirus lockdown rules. Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said police have been directed to only give fines for ""deliberate, obvious and blatant breaches"" and to use a ""common-sense approach"". Clear examples include Airbnb parties with 20 guests, where every attendee was fined; a seven-person dinner party at a house; three friends playing video games in a loungeroom who did not live together; a group of friends hanging out in a park; and four people walking the streets seeking drugs. Police fined 98 people in the 24 hours to 11pm on April 9, including nine youths gathered in a house. There have been grey areas. Police in Victoria have rescinded fines for a man booked for driving to mountain bike alone – driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable and it was the closest bike track to his home. And there was the 17-year-old L-plater whose fine for having a driving lesson with her mum was later rescinded, although police have clarified that driving lessons are indeed non-essential moving forward and so you can be fined for them. In Queensland, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned that police would step up fines after seeing images of a bustling farmers' market on April 4 where patrons had ignored social distancing rules. In the same weekend, police went on to issue 132 fines for $1334, including to 58 people at one car rally in Rochedale. By April 8, police had given out 208 fines, including to five people on April 7 for partying at a Sunshine Coast hotel, claiming they did not know about the social distancing requirements. In WA, drones with lights, sirens and speakers have been brought in to deter people from breaking the rules and there are new on-the-spot $1000 fines for anyone found to be flouting them. According to Premier Mark McGowan, by April 8 three infringements had been issued and eight people had been summoned for breaching directives such as quarantine and self-isolation rules. – with Michael Fowler, Marta Pascual Juanola, Rachel Eddie If you'd like some expert background on an issue or a news event, drop us a line at explainers@smh.com.au or explainers@theage.com.au.

Five young people in a car are fined for driving around aimlessly together. Three friends are fined for playing video games in a loungeroom. All had breached laws aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. In our new reality during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter where you live in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised there are really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Bottom line: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care,"" as federal government text messages are saying. Sound a bit full-on? So are the potential consequences of getting COVID-19. The idea of these rules is to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus by limiting contact with others, thereby flattening the rate of infections and ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed. So far, Australians have been doing a good job of following the rules. The number of new infections recorded every day is falling. But our medical experts have warned now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"" – complacency could see Australia lose its window to contain the outbreak, and cases rapidly explode again. Replay   As questions from you flood into police, governments – and our newsrooms – about what will and won't get you fined on the spot, we've scoured guidelines and public comments from leaders, and put your questions to governments and the police. Here is what we know so far. In all states, you can still visit someone in an emergency or to provide care – or even drop off supplies. But when it comes to social visits to households, it's the unnecessary guests that are now advised against, even if you live alone. Spending time together inside a house, as opposed to on a walk outside (1.5 metres apart), gives the virus more opportunities to spread in bathrooms and kitchens. Victoria has taken one of the tougher lines on guests - banning all non-essential, social visits to homes even between relatives. Premier Daniel Andrews has spoken of a recent dinner party in Victoria at which one person was infected with COVID-19 at the start and several guests had come down with the new illness by the end. In NSW, the position is similar. There are 16 excuses for leaving your home but none of them involve dinner parties, barbecues or beers with mates (see the list below). In Queensland, social visits are allowed for up to two visitors to each household, although strangers can't visit. Tasmania and the ACT still also let you have up to two visitors as long as you are following social distancing measures – allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In WA, social visits are strongly discouraged but not banned outright. (We are still seeking clarification on this.) In South Australia and the Northern Territory, socialising is discouraged but gatherings are limited to 10. Here's something else to bear in mind when deciding what to do: people over 70 and people with a chronic illness, including common conditions such as high blood pressure, are particularly susceptible to complications, even death, from the virus. Every visit brings with it the chance of infection, and some carriers are asymptomatic too – you may not know you are carrying the virus. This was briefly a vexed issue in Victoria and NSW because social visits are otherwise banned. Victoria quickly backed down on its ""bonk ban"", after advising on April 1 that people should not visit or be intimate with partners they didn't live with. Within hours, it had made a specific exemption for romantic couples. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route: he said visiting a partner fell under the category of ""care"", which is one of the 16 reasonable excuses (listed above) for not staying home. ""Mental health,"" he said, ""we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you."" In the other states and territories, visitors can include partners. People can visit as carer.Credit:  While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear – although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. In NSW, the government has yet to clarify this. Victoria has said its own rules allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. 'It’s not smart and it’s not right,' said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews about grandparents babysitting. Still, older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia's chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of the case of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit. Yes, but only if it's essential (this is no time for a backyard blitz) and while keeping your distance. In NSW, as we've seen above, cleaning will fall under caring when it's for someone vulnerable. In Victoria, if you are unwell, disabled, elderly or pregnant you can have a service provider or tradie over ""if you really need help"".

A hard state border closure is also in force. Anyone seeking to come into WA will now be turned away unless they have a valid exemption. Who is exempt from the border closure?  There will also be exemptions for fly-in-fly-out workers and their families but strict 14-day quarantine measures will need to be followed, paid for by the industry. So anyone travelling from interstate or overseas will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, and anyone who does not adhere to this law can be prosecuted.   People in WA will be allowed through road blocks if they want to donate blood. It is exempt from the current restrictions in all states and territories. Road blocks are set up across the nine regions of WA.Credit:  As of April 7, NSW Police have issued 122 personal infringement notices under the Public Health Act since March 17. Among the latest was an off-duty policewoman who was observed allegedly drunk on a city street being assisted by a man. She later told police she had been at a nearby apartment with others including another off-duty policeman. Five people in total were issued infringement notices resulting from the incident. In Victoria, police have issued more than 600 fines for breaches of coronavirus lockdown rules. Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said police have been directed to only give fines for ""deliberate, obvious and blatant breaches"" and to use a ""common-sense approach"". Clear examples include Airbnb parties with 20 guests, where every attendee was fined; a seven-person dinner party at a house; three friends playing video games in a loungeroom who did not live together; a group of friends hanging out in a park; and four people walking the streets seeking drugs. Police fined 98 people in the 24 hours to 11pm on April 9, including nine youths gathered in a house. There have been grey areas. Police in Victoria have rescinded fines for a man booked for driving to mountain bike alone – driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable and it was the closest bike track to his home. And there was the 17-year-old L-plater whose fine for having a driving lesson with her mum was later rescinded, although police have clarified that driving lessons are indeed non-essential moving forward and so you can be fined for them. In Queensland, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned that police would step up fines after seeing images of a bustling farmers' market on April 4 where patrons had ignored social distancing rules. In the same weekend, police went on to issue 132 fines for $1334, including to 58 people at one car rally in Rochedale. By April 8, police had given out 208 fines, including to five people on April 7 for partying at a Sunshine Coast hotel, claiming they did not know about the social distancing requirements. In WA, drones with lights, sirens and speakers have been brought in to deter people from breaking the rules and there are new on-the-spot $1000 fines for anyone found to be flouting them. According to Premier Mark McGowan, by April 8 three infringements had been issued and eight people had been summoned for breaching directives such as quarantine and self-isolation rules. – with Michael Fowler, Marta Pascual Juanola, Rachel Eddie If you'd like some expert background on an issue or a news event, drop us a line at explainers@smh.com.au or explainers@theage.com.au.

""The ultimate sign that [the curve was flattening] would be the number of deaths but the good thing in Australia is that total deaths is very low compared to other countries, and because the number is so small it can bounce around a lot,"" professorial research fellow at Victoria University and former World Health Organisation staff member Maximilian de Courten said. He said the latest deaths also reflect case numbers from previous weeks, rather than the present situation. ""The trend in a fall in the number of new cases will translate to fewer deaths in two weeks. Nobody wants to call it too early but [the numbers] look encouraging.""

""There's a lot of fluctuation in the figures and it depends a lot on the rate of testing and other factors,"" Professor Leeder said. The number of new cases reported daily has dropped at regular intervals in the past month before surging again. There has been a more sustained fall in the number of new cases in NSW since late-March but Professor de Courten said the growing proportion of cases with an unknown source of infection was concerning. Nearly 400 of the 2640 cases recorded in NSW by Sunday were locally acquired and had no known links to any other confirmed case or cluster, representing 15 per cent of the state's total cases. This proportion has been rising steadily for the past two weeks, from 9 per cent on March 24. In comparison, only 6.6 per cent of all cases in Victoria had an unknown source of infection by Sunday. ""Public health experts have a keen eye on NSW and why that figure is higher, and whether that's [trending up] or coming under control,"" Professor de Courten said. ""For that reason we still hold our breath. If community spread decreases, that means we're becoming more efficient in testing and identifying cases."" Additionally, although the number of new cases in NSW has trended down for about a week, the average number of new tests conducted every day so far this month has fallen to 2700, from nearly 4000 per day last month. The number of total cases as a proportion of total tests conducted in NSW has continued to grow since early-March and was at 2.13 per cent on Sunday. NSW Health did not respond to questions about why the number of new daily tests has fallen. Professor Leeder said the response to the pandemic has ""been handled remarkably well"" by governments and the community in Australia. Australia's infection curve also compares well to other countries such as the US and the UK, which are ""still on a very steep increase"", Professor de Courten said. Australia has 5687 cases 26 days after its 100th case. At the same point in its trajectory, the US had 104,686 cases, China had 50,054 cases and Italy had 41,035 cases.

74,/business/the-economy/where-will-all-the-money-come-from-to-fund-the-stimulus-20200403-p54goi.html,Where will all the money come from to fund the stimulus?,"The Morrison government has unleashed stimulus worth more than $200 billion in a bid to save Australia from a very deep and prolonged coronavirus-induced recession. Announcing this week's $130-billion wage subsidy for workers, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg justified the spending by declaring: “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.” But where is all this money coming from? Was it sitting there all along? Who will we have to repay when all this is over? And will we ever get the budget back into black? Understanding what is about to happen to the government's budget requires a basic knowledge of a few things. The federal government has a commitment, over the long run, to balance incoming money from tax collections with outgoing spending on welfare, health services etc. When the government raises more revenue than it spends in a year - for example because a mining boom has turbocharged company tax collections - its budget is said to be in surplus. These surplus funds can then be used to pay down any existing debt. When the Morrison government boasted of getting the budget ""back into black"", it only ever meant that it was going to start running annual budget surpluses – not that it had eliminated debt altogether. In fact, Australian governments have never completely paid off debts accumulated in previous downturns and crises, according to Deloitte Access Economic's Chris Richardson. It's just that economic growth has been so rapid as to dwarf the size of the debt relative to our national income. ""We have always had debt,"" says Richardson. Debt is incurred when government spends more money than it raises in a year – either because revenue has fallen short or spending demands have risen, or both – and the budget falls into deficit. In order to be able to keep paying its regular incoming bills – such as public service wages – the government must borrow to fund any shortfall, adding to any existing pile of debt. Prior to the global financial crisis, the Howard government had managed to reduce Australia's net debt to effectively zero, thanks to the mining boom. After a decade of running big deficits, however, Australian government debt today is, in dollar terms, higher than at any other time in history. As a percentage of our economy, however, net debt is about where it was in the mid-1990s in the aftermath of the early '90s recession. Last financial year, Australian government net debt stood at $373 billion or 19.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares favourably to other nations. Both the United Kingdom and the United States carry net government debt worth about 80 per cent of their economies. At the time of the last budget, the Australian government was forecasting it would achieve a budget surplus this financial year and use the surplus funds to pay down net debt to $360 billion, or 18 per cent of GDP. Now, however, net debt can be expected to top half a trillion dollars. On level three of the Treasury building in Canberra's parliamentary triangle, sits a group of people known as the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM). These people are the government's debt managers. Essentially, they act as intermediaries between the government and its potential lenders. Every couple of days, depending on requirements, they set up online auctions for things called government bonds. These bonds are essentially government promises to repay borrowed money, plus interest, to investors. Investors lodge bids to buy these bonds by indicating what interest rate they will accept, and it's all over in minutes. As of April 3, the AOFM had $579.2 billion of these bonds on issue to investors. We call this the level of Australia's gross debt, with net debt figures much lower, reflecting the offsetting value of various assets also held by the government. In order to fund the stimulus package, the Australian government will simply instruct the AOFM to conduct more frequent and larger auctions of these bonds. As a result, the level of outstanding government debt will go up and so too will the total interest bill that must be paid out. So who buys these bonds? According to the AOFM, just over half of Australian government bonds are held by non-residents. These include foreign banks, central banks and investors, including big pension funds. Even during a crisis, big global pension funds continue to receive a steady stream of contributions from workers and they need somewhere to park the money. The remainder is held by Australian entities, including banks, super funds and other institutional investors. The Reserve Bank has also started to purchase Australian government bonds. It is seeking to keep interest rates low by adding to demand for such bonds. The Reserve has said it will not buy bond directly at the AOFM auctions, to avoid crowding out other lenders, but will instead pick them up in the secondary market. Ultimately, however, we can expect the central bank to become a bigger owner of Australian government bonds. The good news is that debt is very cheap at the moment because interest rates are low. It has been observed that the world has a savings glut of money looking for attractive investment returns, of which, given increased risk aversion in the post-GFC era, there have not been a lot. So far, AOFM auctions for Australian government bonds have tended to be oversubscribed. So, while the value of Australian government debt in dollar terms is historically high, the interest bill on that debt as a proportion of the broader economy is not. The government paid $14 billion in net interest payments on its borrowings last financial year. But as a per cent of GDP, net interest payments were just 0.7 per cent of GDP, compared to 1.7 per cent in the aftermath of the early 1980s and early 1990s recessions. With interest rates as low as they can go, however, and debt set to soar, that interest bill will rise. Slowly, over time. When the virus has run its course, and particularly if the stimulus has been successful in protecting jobs, we can expect spending needs to subside and economic activity to lift, producing more tax revenue. When we start to run budget surpluses again, we can start to pay down the accumulated debt. This may take a very long time. But it is not impossible. The mining boom of the 2000s helped the Howard government restore the budget to balance after the 1990s recession. Chris Richardson is keen to dispel the idea that borrowing today will impose an unfair burden on future generations. With interests rate so low, the interest bill on the additional $213 billion of borrowings will be just $1.6 billion a year. ""That’s not nothing,"" says Richardson. ""You’d much prefer not to have to pay that much extra in interest every year ... Yet these costs are far from scary."" Were, however, the government to fail to act to counteract this economic crisis, Richardson fears the budget – and nation – could end up in a much worse state, as joblessness soars, revenue plummets and welfare costs soar. Richardson says Australia must now be on a war footing: ""Australia’s economy will grow again on the other side of this war. So, here’s a simple suggestion: let’s just let our debts from this new war simply become a smaller share of our growing economy over time. That’s what we did with the war-time debts of the past. And it’s probably the smart play this time too."" ""There are lots of things to be scared of,"" concludes Richardson. ""The fight for our health is a long way from being won. But don’t be scared of the debt – its costs aren’t that bad. And chances are that taking on this debt will be a great investment in Australian livelihoods.""

Four years ago it was Meanjin that was knocked back by the council. This time Australian Book Review, Overland and the online Sydney Review of Books all missed out, much to their chagrin.  Credit:Andrew Dyson As ABR editor Peter Rose put it bluntly in a statement on the magazine's website: ""The Council and its peers demonstrate an unfortunate disregard for the magazine sector, little understanding of its contribution to the literary ecology and no appreciation of the dire consequences for readers, authors, contributors and publishers."" And he continued thus: ""Non-funding imperils the work and the future of magazines around the country, already battered by the unique threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems extraordinary that the Australia Council, at such a perilous time, will not fund seasoned, proven, innovative magazines that so strongly promote Australian writing and publishing."" It is hard to disagree with him. Rose was due to hold talks (along with outgoing chair Colin Golvan and incoming chair Sarah Holland-Batt) with Wenona Byrne, director of literature this week. He told Bookmarks he would be questioning the whole process ""and we will be seeking answers"". SRB editor Catriona Menzies-Pike was disappointed at being knocked back for funding and said the decision would complicate things. ""But we'll be able to carry on publishing."" She said she would be asking questions about the process. ""I am troubled by the implications for the sector generally."" Menzies-Pike's salary is paid by the University of Western Sydney and all grant money SRB has goes to pay its writers, so the decision was ""pulling the rug out from under a large group of writers and critics"". Menzies-Pike said a literary culture needed a lot of different critical, literary publications. ""One of the consequences will be that it be hard for small experimental and emerging publications that are pushing the boundaries."" 'Deplorable': Peter Rose, editor of ABR, is seeking answers to funding cuts. Pictured here in 2001.Credit:Eddie Jim Rose said it was extraordinary that literary magazines should go unfunded by a council that has always supported them as part of the literary scene. He considered the decision evidence of a cultural change at the council that ""we find deplorable"". The loss of the funding represents about 15 per cent of ABR's annual budget and while acknowledging that the magazine would receive special transitioning funding in the next financial year, Rose said the magazine would have to dip into the reserves it had built up over the past few years. Some of the ways in which the magazine had expanded over the past decade, such as prizes, fellowships, tours and podcasts, are likely to be threatened. ""We are a 60-year-old project of some national significance. To give it nothing is very dubious. We have taken a deep blow but we are here for the long haul – just in a diminished form."" He also pointed out that ABR had managed to increase what it paid its critics from a miserly $10 per hundred words to $55. However, a plan to lift their rates to $75 per 100 words would now be put on hold. What Australian literary magazines and bookshops need is someone like James Patterson, who has helped out literacy projects and independent bookshops in the US. The prolific crime writer gave $US250,000 ($412,000) to school libraries and $US1 million to US bookshops in 2015. Of course it helps that he's loaded – in 2019, according to Forbes, he was worth about $US800 million and earned about $US70 million. With advent of the coronavirus he is donating another $US500,000 to help the independent bookshop sector. There is a new campaign in the country, spearheaded by Patterson, actor and book enthusiast Reese Witherspoon and the American Booksellers Association. James Patterson gives more cash to help bookshops.Credit:Dallas Kilponen Patterson has quite a track record. He once put a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the US government to take some sort of action in the face of closing bookshops and consolidation of publishers. ""The White House is concerned about saving the airline industry and big businesses – I get that,"" Patterson said this week. ""But I'm concerned about the survival of independent bookstores, which are at the heart of main streets across the country. I believe that books are essential. They make us kinder, more empathetic human beings. And they have the power to take us away – even momentarily – from feeling overwhelmed, anxious and scared. I hope that the funds we raise keep bookstores alive at a time when we need them the most."" So what we want now is a stinking rich Australian to help out our literary magazines and independent bookshops before any of them get into real strife.

She said she would be asking questions about the process. ""I am troubled by the implications for the sector generally."" Menzies-Pike's salary is paid by the University of Western Sydney and all grant money SRB has goes to pay its writers, so the decision was ""pulling the rug out from under a large group of writers and critics"". Menzies-Pike said a literary culture needed a lot of different critical, literary publications. ""One of the consequences will be that it be hard for small experimental and emerging publications that are pushing the boundaries."" 'Deplorable': Peter Rose, editor of ABR, is seeking answers to funding cuts. Pictured here in 2001.Credit:Eddie Jim Rose said it was extraordinary that literary magazines should go unfunded by a council that has always supported them as part of the literary scene. He considered the decision evidence of a cultural change at the council that ""we find deplorable"". The loss of the funding represents about 15 per cent of ABR's annual budget and while acknowledging that the magazine would receive special transitioning funding in the next financial year, Rose said the magazine would have to dip into the reserves it had built up over the past few years. Some of the ways in which the magazine had expanded over the past decade, such as prizes, fellowships, tours and podcasts, are likely to be threatened. ""We are a 60-year-old project of some national significance. To give it nothing is very dubious. We have taken a deep blow but we are here for the long haul – just in a diminished form."" He also pointed out that ABR had managed to increase what it paid its critics from a miserly $10 per hundred words to $55. However, a plan to lift their rates to $75 per 100 words would now be put on hold. What Australian literary magazines and bookshops need is someone like James Patterson, who has helped out literacy projects and independent bookshops in the US. The prolific crime writer gave $US250,000 ($412,000) to school libraries and $US1 million to US bookshops in 2015. Of course it helps that he's loaded – in 2019, according to Forbes, he was worth about $US800 million and earned about $US70 million. With advent of the coronavirus he is donating another $US500,000 to help the independent bookshop sector. There is a new campaign in the country, spearheaded by Patterson, actor and book enthusiast Reese Witherspoon and the American Booksellers Association. James Patterson gives more cash to help bookshops.Credit:Dallas Kilponen Patterson has quite a track record. He once put a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the US government to take some sort of action in the face of closing bookshops and consolidation of publishers. ""The White House is concerned about saving the airline industry and big businesses – I get that,"" Patterson said this week. ""But I'm concerned about the survival of independent bookstores, which are at the heart of main streets across the country. I believe that books are essential. They make us kinder, more empathetic human beings. And they have the power to take us away – even momentarily – from feeling overwhelmed, anxious and scared. I hope that the funds we raise keep bookstores alive at a time when we need them the most."" So what we want now is a stinking rich Australian to help out our literary magazines and independent bookshops before any of them get into real strife.

On Easter Sunday, she and husband Jeff, and their daughters, Saraya, 10, and Sapphire, 6, will gather as usual with her wider family for lunch – only this time it’ll be via Zoom. In the evening, they’ll enjoy a virtual dinner with Jeff’s Anglo-Indian family. “My background is Italian so food and sharing a meal is really important,” Sanelli says. But it won’t be just eating together over the internet. “Between the three sisters, we’ve all said we’re going to make a different kind of pasta because that’s kind of traditional,” Sanelli says. “We tried making cannelloni the other night (online) with my mum. So we’ll do it together and then nonna can watch over us.” Replay   Sanelli’s girls have also been busy making the place festive, putting up Easter decorations and creating an Easter village. “Every night, we put the lights on the Easter village and have a little Easter egg hunt and make it feel a bit more like Easter and not so locked down.” To overcome the difficulties of running a smooth conversation on Zoom, her daughters have coloured in Easter facemasks, which they’ll hold up as a cute signal they’re ready to speak. Nancy Policheni and husband Joe, traders at the Queen Victoria Market for 25 years, are preparing for their first Easter Sunday physically separated from their family. Usually, the couple and their family would kick off early with an Easter egg hunt for the grandkids before getting into the kitchen to cook up “a fantastic lazy, lazy lunch”, Nancy says. “But things have changed this year so we’ll be FaceTiming each other from each other’s homes,” she says. While two of their daughters live within a couple of minutes’ drive, their third daughter is in LA, and will join the celebration at her dinnertime. “I’ll still make the fritters, I’ll still make certain things and then my husband’s going to be our Uber and deliver them to my daughters' houses so we’ll all still eat the same thing.” Nancy says she is missing her grandchildren “like crazy” but because she and her husband work at the market, they believe it’s safest to stay separate for Easter. “I think I’ll probably shed a tear or two because I won’t have my family around me, but I know that they’re healthy and that to me is the most important,” she says.

I’m not sure if more confident is the way to feel. Probably more relaxed is the way it goes. All the crew’s the same, been hanging out with Hamish [Blake] again, hanging out with everyone again, it was just more familiar and more relaxed. Less pressure, I guess, and expectations – I didn’t know what the world of television was like first time round, it wasn’t my world. It was a lot more fun, we had a blast. Ryan 'The Brickman' McNaught at a Lego show at the Scienceworks Museum in Melbourne last year.Credit:Eddie Jim So you enjoy being on camera? You know what, this is going to sound so lame, and please excuse me if it’s a television cliché because I don’t mean it to be, but you kind of forget that the cameras are even there. It’s all about the contestants and the Lego and all the stuff that’s going on; the fact there’s a bunch of people wearing black behind a camera, you kind of forget about them anyway. I’ll say I leave the TV to the experts, the people who know what they’re doing: the producers and the EPs and the camera guys. I just do what I need to do. Take me back into the past, to the moment when the love affair between you and Lego began. I got my first ever Lego set for my third birthday, from my grandmother. It was a little blue boat. Lego people – the little minifigs – didn’t even exist back then, it was a very long time ago. It stayed with me up until I was about 12 or 13: then it stopped, then sport took over, footy and cricket and cycling. I never played with Lego again until my 30s, when my kids came along. I’ve got twin boys and once they came along, Mum had kept all my Lego from when I was a kid, she said: “You better have all your junk back.” And that included my Lego, and I was like wow, I remember this, and I got back into it that way. So I had a very long period without it; started young and had a bit of a break in the middle. You have an official title in the Lego world. Yeah, Lego Certified Professional – that’s on the business card. But people call me whatever they want, I don’t really mind. There’s 14 of us in the world that hold that title, so I’m very fortunate in that regard. How does one become a Lego Certified Professional? All 14 of us are very different, and we all do different things with Lego bricks. We all push the limits of Lego in different ways. You can’t go to Lego uni and get a degree in Lego-ology. Me, for example, about 10 or so years ago, Lego had this really cool thing in schools called Mindstorms, which was teaching kids about robotics. It was brand new but it was really hard to use; you had to be a Danish mathematician to figure it out, it was almost impossible. Apple had just released the iPad, and I used to be in IT, so what I did was I wrote a piece of software that allowed kids to control this robotics system using the iPad. So I got two letters from Lego: one letter saying this is awesome, we love what you’re doing, let’s do some stuff together; and another letter which was a cease-and-desist for breaking into their software and trying to change things. I had to tell them to talk to each other. It’s one way to get attention. So you’re at the cutting edge of Lego technology. It’s funny … Lego’s developed a lot since I did that; they’ve taken what I did and amplified it 5000 times over with many more clever people than me. But what I like to do nowadays is really push the physical limits of what the brick is capable of doing and that means doing big, stupid, crazy things with Lego bricks. Things that not even Lego knew that it was capable of doing. So my charter over the past 10 years has been to do things that people don’t expect with Lego bricks. What’s an example of something that people don’t expect that you’ve done? Well, a life-size car out of Lego bricks. Weighs more than a real car. Things like, we built a 10-metre-high Christmas tree, the one that was in Fed Square a couple of years back – you’ve got to use cranes and big machinery and that kind of stuff. You don’t think about Lego in that kind of mindset, so it’s my job to inspire people to go wow, Lego can do that? Imagine what I could do at home. You’ve pushed the limits of Lego to such an extent – when you go on the show can the contestants still impress you? Definitely is the short answer. The long answer is: the trick about Lego Masters is that six Lego bricks – plain two-by-four Lego bricks – can go together 900 million different ways. So when we give the contestants a couple of million Lego bricks, there’s not a supercomputer on Earth that can work out the permutations. Every single build is unique in its own way. So watching the creative process of these amazing people is inspiring for me. When I’m doing my Lego at home, should I follow the instructions? Apart from on Lego Masters, which is the only time this statement doesn’t apply, there is absolutely no right or wrong with Lego bricks. I always tell kids that when I build Lego, I build it to the instructions first and then it’s a matter of how long will it last until I pull it apart and build something else.

Woo-hoo! On a day when the sacrifices Australians are making continued to pile up exponentially, the NRL declared that its own game-day sacrifices are coming to an end. Let’s get this party started! All on its own, league is creating a coronavirus-free world. Each day, you hope to discover that rugby league is not actually like this, that it still has the brain you thought it had. Your hopes are raised when you see headlines of stories warning the NRL not to ‘trash its brand’ or ‘act irresponsibly’, but it turns out that its only concern is that the competition has an equitable number of rounds or that the measures to control a viral outbreak among players and staff can be controlled. About the real issue, there is no discussion.  Credit:Illustration: Simon Letch The NRL’s plans are formulated by an ‘innovation’ committee with a name, Apollo, that suggests rocket science, but it’s more like Greek myth. Its fate is pre-determined. Whatever ‘innovation’ takes place is confined within the committee’s brief, which is to find ‘innovative’ ways of restarting the competition in May, a full four months before the rest of us have been told we can expect our world to return to normal. Thinking truly outside the box – say, asking whether rugby league has a greater duty to the community than getting its income streams flowing again, or asking whether it is humanly decent to place sport on such a pedestal to its own self-regard – is too far outside. It’s not a box, it’s a hall of mirrors. And then you look to the outside world to speak truth to league. Governments and health authorities are entering a particularly difficult time. They seem to have done a good job containing the virus, but this only taxes people’s patience more. Unrest is growing every day. The corona-sceptics are on the march. It was all exaggerated. People are getting restless and need persuasion, more than ever, to work together. But here’s rugby league, putting out a big noise: we can loosen up now! Is anyone going to control them? Up steps John Barilaro, the leader of the NSW National Party, informing us that rugby league is ‘the tonic we need’ to get us through the virus. And you thought the tonic was drinking hot water and swallowing malaria pills. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. So here comes rugby league, afloat in its bubble, engorged with its self-importance, looking after its own, breaking ranks with Australia and the world. When families can’t see each other for Easter, rugby league is celebrating the Easter miracle of once again making itself the news. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. But what also appeals, from a lifetime of enjoying league, is its decency. After encountering league people over the years, you almost invariably come away with the feeling that you have met someone fundamentally decent. In fact, this decency sets league apart from so many other sports. League people are the salt of the earth. You know that that has to be a fantasy as well, but it’s your personal experience. Compared to other sports, league is replete with genuine, straight-talking, likeable humans. Not people who’ve got their heads so far up their fundaments that they don’t see, much less respect, what is going on in the world outside their bubble. So, while you, the league fan, are fighting with your son to convince him why he can’t go and visit his girlfriend, league is back on. While you can’t celebrate your elderly widowed mother’s birthday with her, league is on. While you go outside in this horrible Australia where police question you for being outdoors and people stink-eye other people for stopping and talking to each other, league is on. While another million people catch a disease and tens of thousands die, league is back on. But you know what? When the NRL starts again, on May 28 or whenever, you will have wrestled with your conscience over whether it is the right thing to sit down and watch this renegade sport, this pariah code, this arena of self-absorption. By then it will have all worn you down. You will give in, because you just want to feel good again, and league will make you feel good. Like a dumb animal, you’ll go towards the thing you can’t help loving, and you’ll celebrate it, because by then, who knows, you might desperately need something to celebrate. League will give you what you need, by giving itself what it needs. You will watch it. And this is when you realise you were kidding yourself all along, you were the simple fool; and you will give up trying to convince your friends that you love league because it is an intelligent and decent game.

About the real issue, there is no discussion.  Credit:Illustration: Simon Letch The NRL’s plans are formulated by an ‘innovation’ committee with a name, Apollo, that suggests rocket science, but it’s more like Greek myth. Its fate is pre-determined. Whatever ‘innovation’ takes place is confined within the committee’s brief, which is to find ‘innovative’ ways of restarting the competition in May, a full four months before the rest of us have been told we can expect our world to return to normal. Thinking truly outside the box – say, asking whether rugby league has a greater duty to the community than getting its income streams flowing again, or asking whether it is humanly decent to place sport on such a pedestal to its own self-regard – is too far outside. It’s not a box, it’s a hall of mirrors. And then you look to the outside world to speak truth to league. Governments and health authorities are entering a particularly difficult time. They seem to have done a good job containing the virus, but this only taxes people’s patience more. Unrest is growing every day. The corona-sceptics are on the march. It was all exaggerated. People are getting restless and need persuasion, more than ever, to work together. But here’s rugby league, putting out a big noise: we can loosen up now! Is anyone going to control them? Up steps John Barilaro, the leader of the NSW National Party, informing us that rugby league is ‘the tonic we need’ to get us through the virus. And you thought the tonic was drinking hot water and swallowing malaria pills. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. So here comes rugby league, afloat in its bubble, engorged with its self-importance, looking after its own, breaking ranks with Australia and the world. When families can’t see each other for Easter, rugby league is celebrating the Easter miracle of once again making itself the news. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. But what also appeals, from a lifetime of enjoying league, is its decency. After encountering league people over the years, you almost invariably come away with the feeling that you have met someone fundamentally decent. In fact, this decency sets league apart from so many other sports. League people are the salt of the earth. You know that that has to be a fantasy as well, but it’s your personal experience. Compared to other sports, league is replete with genuine, straight-talking, likeable humans. Not people who’ve got their heads so far up their fundaments that they don’t see, much less respect, what is going on in the world outside their bubble. So, while you, the league fan, are fighting with your son to convince him why he can’t go and visit his girlfriend, league is back on. While you can’t celebrate your elderly widowed mother’s birthday with her, league is on. While you go outside in this horrible Australia where police question you for being outdoors and people stink-eye other people for stopping and talking to each other, league is on. While another million people catch a disease and tens of thousands die, league is back on. But you know what? When the NRL starts again, on May 28 or whenever, you will have wrestled with your conscience over whether it is the right thing to sit down and watch this renegade sport, this pariah code, this arena of self-absorption. By then it will have all worn you down. You will give in, because you just want to feel good again, and league will make you feel good. Like a dumb animal, you’ll go towards the thing you can’t help loving, and you’ll celebrate it, because by then, who knows, you might desperately need something to celebrate. League will give you what you need, by giving itself what it needs. You will watch it. And this is when you realise you were kidding yourself all along, you were the simple fool; and you will give up trying to convince your friends that you love league because it is an intelligent and decent game.

The NRL has earmarked May 28 as the day the premiership will recommence, although they need the players’ union to first agree to the revenues, operating costs and welfare provisions in order for that to happen. Replay   The Rugby League Players Association and head office had agreed to a new pay deal based on the worst-case scenario of no matches being played in 2020, with the parties still yet to agree to the terms of a resumption. That includes receiving a minimum of 29.5 per cent of any additional revenue that could flow into the game as a result in play resuming. The players are keen to return to the field but first want some assurances before doing so. That includes an understanding of the NRL’s operational costs to restart, an important consideration given the stinging criticism head office has received over how much money is being spent to run the game. The Herald last month revealed Rugby League Central spends almost $500,000 a day to run the competition, while broadcast partner Channel Nine - the publishers of this masthead - claims countless millions were “squandered by a bloated head office” in an extraordinary broadside on Thursday. RLPA CEO Clint Newton said the game can’t restart until his members are given assurances about the manner in which it will do so. RLPA board member Daly Cherry-Evans and his fellow NRL players are yet to sign off on a May 28 return.Credit:Getty “I’d like to think it won’t be like a CBA negotiation given the time criticalities associated with this,” Newton said. “We need to be very clear on what’s been brought in and that we’re agreeing on the operational costs. We then need to reach agreement over the distribution to the stakeholder groups over those revenues. “There are a number of key areas and we need to work through the detail. A lot will hinge on what we’re able to generate when building those contract arrangements. “To be clear, we understand why the NRL have proposed a start date. But there are things critical in all of this and that’s why the player consultation process and engagement is paramount. “We still need that information before the players are in a position to endorse or support it. That’s around the welfare and well-being support, the injury management and the revenue, which comes in two parts - the operational costs and the distribution of the revenues.” The RLPA have negotiated the right to conduct a special purpose audit of the NRL’s books and are likely to commence that process next week. The players are keen to understand why the game’s running costs are currently $181 million per annum and what steps the NRL will take to reduce them. The union also wants assurances the health of the players won’t be compromised during the coronavirus, while wanting the Warriors to be given every support while they are away from home. That could include having their families travel with them to Australia. “Player well-being and welfare support (are key considerations),” Newton said. “Medical and injury management, the treatment of injuries and access to facilities and revenue. “We want to know what revenue we are able to generate via a revised competition and one that may be without crowds for an entire year. “Then the operational costs of ensuring best practice is applied and then the percentage distribution of that revenue.” Adrian Proszenko is the Chief Rugby League Reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald.

Sources with knowledge of the deal suggest Fox Sports will have to pay the final quarterly sum for this season, due on April 15, but could issue FFA with a breach notice if the A-League remains postponed by the end of this financial year. Barrister Bret Walker, SC (left) is advising FFA through its looming broadcast clash with Fox Sports. Credit:AAP Under the terms of the contract, the FFA is free to postpone the A-League season without punishment so long as they complete the entire season within a contract year, which runs from July 1 until June 30. FFA is due to decide on April 22 as to whether the season can resume but there appears to be very little prospect of play being resumed in the short term. Senior A-League sources are touting a possible return date in July, but even that isn't certain.

FFA chief James Johnson is looking at alternatives in case Fox Sports withdraws from the A-League.Credit:AAP Sydney-based Walker is one Australia's foremost legal minds and has taken on a wide range of high-profile cases throughout his career, having represented rugby league players, tobacco companies, politicians and alleged organised crime figures. He also headed the royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, the review into national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and Swimming Australia's probe of drug use within the country's swimming team at the London Olympics in 2012. A High Court appeals specialist, Walker successfully argued Cardinal Pell's convictions for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996 should be quashed. The involvement of a barrister of Walker's calibre in football's affairs is a sign of how seriously FFA and the A-League is treating the prospect of a court battle with Foxtel, the owners of Fox Sports, to enforce the remainder of the TV contract and other similar arrangements with sponsors which could also come into question. There are three seasons left to run on the current broadcast deal but Fox Sports has not given any assurances to FFA, clubs or players about the future. The uncertainty has prompted FFA and club owners to begin canvassing potential broadcasters for next season. Fox Sports is facing a major financial crisis of its own, with more than 200 workers at parent company Foxtel made redundant this week and a further 140 stood down without pay in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fox is not expected to step away from its obligations with the AFL or NRL, but has been unhappy with the ratings performance of the A-League for some time, and many recent staff cuts have included football-specific presenters, producers and journalists.

The involvement of a barrister of Walker's calibre in football's affairs is a sign of how seriously FFA and the A-League is treating the prospect of a court battle with Foxtel, the owners of Fox Sports, to enforce the remainder of the TV contract and other similar arrangements with sponsors which could also come into question. There are three seasons left to run on the current broadcast deal but Fox Sports has not given any assurances to FFA, clubs or players about the future. The uncertainty has prompted FFA and club owners to begin canvassing potential broadcasters for next season. Fox Sports is facing a major financial crisis of its own, with more than 200 workers at parent company Foxtel made redundant this week and a further 140 stood down without pay in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fox is not expected to step away from its obligations with the AFL or NRL, but has been unhappy with the ratings performance of the A-League for some time, and many recent staff cuts have included football-specific presenters, producers and journalists.

Instead he will battle his 11-year-old son Charlie for it over putting competitions. The Masters, which Woods won in magical fashion for a fifth time a year ago to claim his first major since 2008, has been postponed until November because of the coronavirus pandemic which has shut down world sport on an unprecedented scale. Tiger Woods dons his fifth green jacket following his remarkable win at Augusta National last year.Credit:AP Like his rivals, Woods, 44, has been kicking his heels at home, waiting for the day the PGA Tour can restart. While he has enjoyed the family time, including 2000-piece jigsaw puzzles and cupcakes, Woods admits being ""wired"" to play but not preparing for Augusta's first tee has been difficult. His local course (Medallist) in Hobe Sound, Florida has remained open, however, and playing against Charlie has meant he can sharpen his competitive instincts. ""We've been able to go out there and compete,"" Woods said in an interview with streaming service GOLFTV. ""He's got a lot better at throwing the needle at me now and he's accepting it faster and reversing it back. We have a deal, in the backyard generally every night we'll play putting matches and the winner gets to keep the green jacket in the closet. ""Occasionally it's gone into his closet. Primarily it's stayed in mine but the fact he's been able to earn it off me because there are no wins that are given in this family. ""It's been fun to see him tease me about beating me and being able to wear the jacket and have it in his closet where he says it belongs."" As a defending champion, the build-up to the Masters is unique. Not being able to host the Champions Dinner, or enjoy the par-three event held the day before, has left a void. Woods held an improvised Champions Dinner at home with partner Erica Herman and children Charlie and Sam instead. ""We had exactly the same. We had steak and chicken pieces, sushi and sashimi,"" Woods, who battled back from knee and back injuries to claim his 15th major at Augusta last year, said. ""We had cupcakes and milkshakes for dessert. So it was exactly what I was going to serve. As I said, Masters Dinner quarantine style with my family. ""It got a little bit interesting at the end, a little ugly, where icing was flowing across people's hair and face! We had a little bit of fun at the end."" Joking aside, Woods says the Masters postponement is tough. ""This is not the way that I would've wanted to keep the jacket for a longer period of time,"" he said. ""I wanted to get out there and compete for it and earn it again. ""I'm wired, I've been doing it for 25 years now and so it's hard to find the wire, those circuits now, I do feel a little edgy. I want to get there and play - I want to compete. ""Fortunately, we potentially could have a Masters in November and play it then. I guess I'll be defending then and hopefully that all comes about."" Apart from playing golf with Charlie, Woods says cycling and watching his children on the tennis court in his garden have helped him stay relaxed during the lockdown. The long injury lay-offs that have snagged his career have also helped him deal with the current situation he describes as ""a war with an invisible enemy"". ""I've been through episodes like this in my career with my back, where seconds seem like months, you have to slow things down and do things at a different pace,"" he said. ""I know it's frustrating, it's boring at times, but in the end we are trying to save lives, flatten the curve,"" he said. ""It's not a normal world.

Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk though a long-term plan."" In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfilled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic.

The sickness attacking sport was cost-accelerating, unsustainable debt, mainly for media rights of the football codes and cricket. All this came at a time the revenue streams of the free-to-air and pay-TV broadcasters were under siege from streaming services such as Netflix. Replay   So, when the NRL’s long-time FTA broadcast partner, Channel Nine, delivered a scathing attack on the code on Thursday, it was paradoxically both unprecedented and unsurprising. It’s all about cost. Nine doesn’t want to pay full freight for a disrupted season with falling viewership. Nor will the network even agree to pay a pro-rata amount for games telecast, given it will be played in empty stadiums, devoid of the theatre of the crowd, possibly all through 2020. Furthermore, Nine boss Hugh Marks probably wants to renegotiate the final two years of the 2018-22 contract. In fact, he almost certainly seeks to extend the existing contract at significantly reduced rates. The days when networks bought sports rights to prevent the opposition acquiring them – as Manly bought North Sydney first-graders and relegated them to reserve grade – are over. But for Nine to launch this brutal salvo on rugby league because it has been shut out of the confidential talks over a restructured 2020 competition is a diversion. Fox Sports, which televises exclusively five games a week to Nine’s simulcasted three, has been sidelined, too. Given that ARLC chairman Peter V’landys is very close to News Corporation, which owns Fox, and has been the beneficiary of some recent, lavish praise from its newspapers, Fox’s Patrick Delany could have come out with a petulant page one protest. ARLC chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP However, the shunning of both of the code’s telecasters ignores V’landys management approach, which is the converse of today’s inclusive style of empowering everyone around the boss. He is autocratic and makes decisions quickly. NRL clubs are finding that ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce and ex-member for Dubbo Troy Grant, a former NSW Nationals leader, have formed a triumvirate, with V’landys dominating and everyone else subservient. Clubs are equally in the dark, unsure whether the competition, due to restart on May 28, will be located in Sydney or Queensland, or whether it will be two conferences or one. Now, with the Herald suggesting all remaining rounds will be played, it would seem V’landys, while not talking to the telecasters, is at least listening, or more accurately, reading Marks’s play. While Fox Sports hasn’t attacked the NRL with the unprecedented venom of Nine, it’s not as if the Murdoch empire hasn’t played a hard line with the other football codes in these belt-tightening times. It is a network that has previously demonstrated a duty of care to Australian sports – it paid a restructured FFA above market rates to unshackle it from a nationalistic, sectional club structure and it elevated rugby union from shamateurism, launching Super Rugby 25 years ago with a $US550m 10-year contract. But Fox Sports is bleeding red ink. It is dependent on $1.07 billion in shareholders' loans, has made 200 staff redundant and stood down another 140 on Tuesday. Those numbers could yet double as it seeks to further protect its bottom line. Now Fox Sports is refusing to make another rights offer to Rugby Australia and will seek to free itself from soccer, with both sports having already sacked most of their staff. So, where does that leave rugby league? It is a sport on the federal government’s anti-siphoning list, meaning it must be offered to a FTA broadcaster before Foxtel can bid. The financial meltdown, aka the Corona Correction, won’t result in NRL being screened on the ABC, because no commercial network can exist without NRL or AFL. Channel Ten had NRL in the 1990s, lost AFL rights 10 years ago and, as Global Sport and Media’s Colin Smith says, it has caused ""a downward spiral ever since and led to their insolvency”. Rather than abandon rugby league, Nine is likely to seek  “exclusive NRL” content in a renegotiated contract, refusing Fox’s simulcast of its games. Nine’s boss has picked only his first mark.

In a statement, tennis's governing body said it was implementing a range of measures to ""safeguard jobs and protect the long-term health of our organisation and our sport"" with president David Haggerty voluntarily taking a 30 per cent salary cut for the rest of the year. Ashleigh Barty and Sam Stosur in last year's Fed Cup final.  This year's revamped finals were scheduled to begin next week.Credit:Getty Images ""The situation we are facing represents a fundamental challenge to our organisation and our sport,"" Haggerty, who was re-elected for another term last year, said in a statement. ""Our purpose is to ensure the long-term growth and sustainability of our sport in collaboration with our 210 member nations, which is why we are making difficult decisions in the short term so that we can continue to deliver tennis for future generations across the globe."" The London-based governing body said half its staff would be placed on the UK government's job retention scheme. Under the scheme, employers can claim for 80 per cent of furloughed employees' monthly wages, capped at £2500 ($4923) per month. The ITF will top up those payments to ensure all staff stood down receive 80 per cent of their full salary. The ITF's revamped Fed Cup Finals was one of the high-profile events postponed. It was supposed to have taken place this month in Budapest. ""We have postponed more than 900 tournaments across all ITF circuits, including the Fed Cup by BNP Paribas Finals 2020, and it remains uncertain when play can resume,"" a statement read. ""While postponing events and prioritising safety is the appropriate response in these exceptional circumstances, it has resulted in a number of complex challenges, including a significant loss of income."" With so many tournaments postponed, the earning potential of hundreds of players has effectively dried up - a serious issue for those lower down the rankings who struggle to make a living even in normal times. The ITF said it was in discussion with other tennis stakeholders to provide support for nations and players. Reuters Copyright © 2020", ,"April 10, 2020"

Bangladesh's Mominul Haque plays a shot against  Australia  in Chittagong in 2017.  Credit:AP The widespread expectation was the trip would be cancelled because of the health crisis, which has prompted governments around the world to introduce a wide range of restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed the inevitable postponement on Thursday night, with chief executive Kevin Roberts calling it ‘‘regrettable’’ in a statement. ‘‘I would like to thank the Bangladesh Cricket Board for the open, honest and responsible discussions that led us to this mutually agreed position,’’ Roberts said. The health of our people and communities is the No.1 priority for both boards. ‘‘The health of our people and communities is the No.1 priority for both boards and that is reflected in the action we have taken in postponing the two Test matches. ‘‘As we know, the global cricket calendar is very busy, but we will do everything we can to honour our commitment to Bangladesh and will continue to work with the BCB on an agreed date.’’ Australia’s next scheduled commitment beyond Bangladesh is a limited-overs tour of England in July,  and that trip is also in extreme doubt. CA, other national boards and the International Cricket Council (ICC) face a tough ask attempting to piece the schedule back together whenever the sport resumes, especially with the inaugural world Test championship final set to be held at Lord’s in 2021. The Australia-Bangladesh series was set to count towards the world Test championship table, likewise the recent series between England and Sri Lanka that was also aborted because of COVID-19 concerns. Paine and national coach Justin Langer have both identified reaching and winning the world Test championship final as a key goal for their team. ‘‘I hope they don’t push it back too far for my sake, that’s for sure,’’ the 35-year-old Paine said recently, regarding the prospect of the much-anticipated game being possibly delayed. ‘‘I think all players would be in favour of trying to finish that ...  if it doesn’t happen, there are bigger issues in the world. ‘‘Maybe the players are going to have to go through a period where we play quite a bit of cricket if we want to complete the Test championship as it is.’’ Copyright © 2020", Rob Forsaith ,"April 9, 2020"

The ARL Commission is due to receive a recommendation from the organisation’s Project Apollo innovation committee on Thursday about when and in which form the season should resume, with chairman Peter V’landys hopeful of a May 21 return. Replay   The proposal to have a rebooted competition up and running again without crowds in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, however, has not won the support of the game’s long-time free-to-air broadcaster Nine. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has told the NRL there is less value attached to the game being played behind closed doors and under a different structure and the media company wants to negotiate a new contract with the code. But with the game’s administrators preparing to announce the shape and timing of a resumed season, Nine has delivered an extraordinary shot at League Central on Thursday. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” said a spokesperson for Nine, the owner of The Sydney Morning Herald. “It would now appear that much has been squandered by a bloated head office.” “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on to support the clubs, the players and supporters. In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. “It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk though a long-term plan."" The attack will add to fears Nine could walk away from the game after a decades-long association with rugby league. The company announced to the stock exchange last week that it would save $130m if the sport did not resume this year because of COVID-19 as it outlined plans to shave $266m from its costs. Marks, who was unveiled as CEO at Willoughby in the same month that the NRL’s $1.8 billion television deal with Nine and Foxtel was signed in November 2015, has also in the past made clear his belief that broadcasters can no longer afford to bid exorbitant amounts for sports rights if it is not profitable. The NRL's long-time free-to-air broadcaster has hit out at the game's powerbrokers.Credit:Getty Images The NRL’s current agreements with Nine, Foxtel and Telstra, which began in 2018, run until 2022. Foxtel’s deal is worth about $1 billion, or $200m a year, while Nine signed up to pay a reported $625m over the life of the contract, or $125m a year. Neither company paid their quarterly instalments last week after the competition was put on hold following advice from the NRL’s biosecurity expert. The NRL has been rushing to get the season started again as the rate of infection decreases sharply in Australia, eager to have revenue from broadcasters pouring into the game again. It has stood down most of its staff and as costs are cut significantly across the game and chief executive Todd Greenberg has agreed to take the same 71 per cent pay cut as players. Yet with Nine arguing for a new contract - and Foxtel also having told the NRL the value of its deal decreases if the season runs beyond October - there are tense negotiations ahead.

Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk though a long-term plan."" In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfilled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic. Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany did not return calls. Chris Barrett is Sports Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", Chris Barrett ,"April 9, 2020"

Brian Borruso said in court papers on Tuesday he tried to take a selfie as Woods approached his tee shot left of the 13th green in the third round at Innisbrook. Replay   But Joe LaCava ""intentionally shoved"" him, causing him to stumble and fall into the crowd. Josh Drechsel, the lawyer representing Borruso, said the lawsuit was filed two years after the tournament to get a better understanding of the injuries, described in the lawsuit as ""either permanent or continuing."" Mark Steinberg, the agent for Woods at Excel Sports Management, did not immediately reply to a text seeking comment. LaCava said he had no comment. Tiger Woods' caddie Joe LaCava has been accused of ""intentionally shoving"" a fan.Credit:AP Drechsel, meanwhile, issued a public plea for evidence from fans who might have been at the 13th green that day and witnessed the incident. One video Dreshsel has shows LaCava approaching the fans with his left arm extended saying: ""You've got to back it up."" Drechsel says he wants to find the fans who could be heard on another video. ""One says, 'I love Tiger, but I don't like him' and another voice is heard saying, 'He just pushed him. He just shoved him right out of there.'"" The lawsuit says Borruso went to the hospital to be treated for his injuries. Woods played the Valspar Championship for the first time in 2018, a key event in his return from back surgeries. Before record crowds, at times standing a dozen rows deep around tee boxes, he came within one putt on the 18th hole of forcing a play-off and finished one shot behind Paul Casey. Woods was named as a defendant because he employs LaCava, who previously was the long-time caddie for Fred Couples and began working for Woods in the autumn of 2011. Drechsel said he asked the PGA Tour for video from the tournament but said the tour told him it was unable to provide any without a court order. AP Copyright © 2020", Doug Ferguson ,"April 9, 2020"

Remarkably, even losing bets were offered cash-out figures and those customers were given bonus bets in way of an apology. The cash-out option on quaddies remains unavailable to customers as Tabcorp tests the software. Favourite Rubisaki wins the last leg of Saturday's quaddie at Randwick but by then some punters had cashed out for a windfall.Credit:AAP Tabcorp has worked through 1353 cases on the Victorian, ACT and NSW TABs and has paid punters the final quaddie dividend if they cashed out and were alive going into the fourth leg of the exotic bet, regardless of whether they had the winner in the final leg. “Those customers who weren’t alive in the quaddie at the time, but nonetheless received and accepted an incorrect cash-out offer, have received an apology message from us and a bonus bet,” TAB’s Adam Hamilton said. “The remaining group that were alive after the third leg will be given the greater of the correct cash-out amount or the full quaddie payment irrespective of whether they got the final leg or not. “This group was notified of that last night and that payment process has begun. These customers will also receive an apology bonus bet. “Almost all impacted customers have had their full account access restored.” One punter posted a picture on social media that they accepted an offer of $235,447.87 for just over 51 per cent of the Sydney quaddie, which ended up paying just $7506.80 for 100 per cent in NSW. The Cash Out option allows punters to take a dividend at any point for a quaddie, a bet where you have to select the winners of four selected races, usually for a smaller percentage of the dividend. The TAB froze the accounts of punters involved and the majority of those are now active again. It was fortunate for the TAB that the only betting on Saturday’s meeting was done through accounts with all agencies and PubTABs shut because of the coronavirus crisis. “[The] incorrect cash-out offers were generated as a result of a systems error. Where these were accepted, in some cases this led to incorrect credits being made to those customers' accounts,” Hamilton said. “We have been working through this issue to ensure we provide the correct reconciliation of balances. “The process has now been finalised. Communications went out to impacted customers last night and payments to those eligible have been initiated, while customers who weren’t eligible received an apology bonus bet.” Tabcorp managing director for wagering and media Adam Rytenskild apologised to customers involved in the quaddie drama. “I’m sorry for the frustration this technical fault has caused some of our customers,” Rytenskild said. “Rectifying the problem has been our top priority this week and our people have been working around the clock to fix it to ensure customers that are entitled to receive payment get those funds as soon as possible and that all impacted customers are looked after. “That process is nearing completion with payments and bonus bets being distributed.” Racing writer for The Sydney Morning Herald Copyright © 2020", Chris Roots ,"April 9, 2020"

The 30-year-old former Sydney Roosters and Penrith front-rower suffered the career-ending injury in January when making a routine tackle for Hull KR in a trial match. Replay   Masoe snapped ligaments in his neck and was initially initially paralysed from the shoulders down. Three months into his stay at a specialist spinal unit at the Pinderfields Hospital in Yorkshire, Masoe was told last week he would need to move home to continue his rehabilitation due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, doctors managed to persuade hospital officials to keep him on the ward so his improvements could be monitored more closely. “I’m just making the most of every day in here,” Masoe said in an interview with Sky Sports. “I’ve made so much progress in myself and I’m very grateful to be in here “In just one week I've learnt how to transfer from my chair into a bath chair, I’ve started to walk with crutches. “I’ve got my own walking frame, so I walk around my bed just with a frame.

As other football codes get on the front foot with plans to restart respective competitions, rugby’s predicament is far more complex given the amount of international travel and convoluted beast that is Super Rugby, which was paused seven rounds into the season. Replay   Rugby Australia’s general manager of professional services, Ben Whitaker, is a leading figure on a committee – a 'Think Tank"" if you will – that features Australian Super Rugby club chief executives, other RA officials and the Rugby Union Players Association. The group catch up via a phone hook-up twice a week and have been doing so for the last three weeks. They analyse a number of drafted models that fluctuate from kick-offs as early as May and as late as November, while also taking into account what the international season could entail. Ideas are then presented at weekly meetings with SANZAAR, which is keeping an eye on the fast-changing situations in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. First and foremost, Whitaker has stressed that player safety is paramount and that rugby is not sitting on its hands despite a perception that may be the case. The Sunwolves have had to remain in Japan due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Credit:Getty “I wouldn’t have thought we’re that different [to other codes],” Whitaker told the Herald. “It might be a bit different how we’re communicating it. “We’re ready to go once the restrictions for sport, but more importantly the community, are able to be lessened. Like all sports, we’ve got direct connections in through government to make sure we’re on top of the latest information. “We’re really well positioned to deliver Super Rugby and Test-match footy as soon as we can start playing. We’re updating our modelling that makes us as as agile as possible.” The immediate priority is getting rugby back on Australians shores, thus ensuring there is a broadcast revenue stream. A five-team competition, with the four Super Rugby sides plus the Western Force was scrapped late last month due to escalating restrictions. Whitaker has revealed the Sunwolves, an Australian conference rival who were set to be cut from Super Rugby at the end of this season, have flagged interest in being involved. Border restrictions would need to be relaxed – only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members are able to enter the country – and the team subjected to a self-isolation period but it is certainly an option. Six teams would provide three games a weekend and more content. “The modelling is inclusive of them and they’re very keen to participate if and when they can,” Whitaker said. “We’ve engaged with the Western Force as well to be part of it. That’s how six teams would come together quite quickly. “If it was possible, you can see isolation periods coming into play. If that wasn’t an option … we’d move to another model.” A lot will depend on the international calendar, with travel restrictions potentially ruining plans for Test matches in 2020, which would be a disaster for not only RA but other unions around the globe. “Our No.1 goal is to deliver both levels of footy,” Whitaker said. “The inability to travel internationally is worst case scenario but we have the model for that. We’re very hopeful we don’t have to go down that path.” So what about the idea of a ‘bubble’, whereby teams can bunker down in one location to train and play away from the general public? It seems even the NRL has gone cold on the idea and while it is not warmly received by rugby’s decision-makers, Whitaker said it couldn’t be ruled out. For something like the Rugby Championship, it could be extremely beneficial. “Our advice is that would be very difficult to implement immediately,” Whitaker said. “It doesn’t mean it’s not an option in the future if it enables rugby to get up and running. The health and safety of our participants and community must be absolutely guaranteed.” A Bledisloe Cup fixture at Twickenham on October 31 was another left-field suggestion tossed out, as well as a three-match series against the Kiwis in Australia in December. Club rugby is expected to run concurrently with a domestic competition, while a supercharged four-week Australian Club Championship with 16 teams has been discussed, which could see Test players return if there is no international action. “If we’ve maximised the chance to play Super Rugby, then that could be an option,” Whitaker said. “I have to emphasise though we want to deliver our professional rugby comps first and foremost.” Tom Decent is a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald Copyright © 2020", Tom Decent ,"April 9, 2020"

There is enough speed for him to get his chance in this and he won’t be spotting such a big start this time around. The bonus is Tom Marquand in the saddle. 1. Yao Dash was confidently supported first up in the Fireball but never looked comfortable and found nothing when asked to quicken. Too classy to dismiss off one bad run.How to play it: Indy Car to win. 2. Through The Cracks motored to the line behind 10. Asharani in the Gosford qualifier run at Newcastle. He meets Asharani 1.5kg better off in the final. That was dropping back to 1200m having been so impressive at his first crack at 1400m seven weeks prior at Warwick Farm. The barrier looks ugly but it’s inconsequential with this five-year-old as he generally flops out the back anyway. That’s the negative – the start he’ll give away – but James McDonald jumps aboard replacing apprentice Jenny Duggan. He trialled brilliantly since too, splitting two group 1 winners. The market looks too heavily weighted towards the heat winners as can make a case for 1. McCormack to turn the tables on 12. Electric Girl from Kembla.How to play it: Through The Cracks to win. How much gas is still in the tank for 2. Away Game? That’s the gamble because if this iron filly holds her form, she’ll win. None of these rivals boast a record anything even close to watch she has achieved in six starts. She won the Magic Millions by a space and won the group 3 Widden just as comfortably before running a brave fourth in the Blue Diamond given the way the track played. She wasn’t done yet, running second to Farnan in the Golden Slipper. It’s two-year-old form off the very top shelf. The cautionary tale would be that Golden Slipper winner Kiamichi ran last in this race last year. 10. Rock My Wand is on the back-up after trouncing her rivals in testing conditions at Rosehill. Recent run behind Thermosphere ties in with some of the second-tier form here.How to play it: Away Game to win. Still scratching my head as to what happened to 1. Cosmic Force in the group 1 Galaxy. The three-year-old was heavily backed to start a clear favourite but, after peeling off backs at the 300m, he didn’t let down. It wasn’t anything like what we saw from the Peter and Paul Snowden-trained colt first-up when he savaged the line behind 11. Villami in the Fireball. The trial of Cosmic Force since then restored my faith that the horse is flying. With James McDonald back in the saddle, and the winkers on, Cosmic Force made light work of his rivals on the Kensington track to win by a widening seven lengths. 9. Flit is a group 1 winner over the mile but suspect she is a sprinter. Challenge for her is coming back off a 1600m run, and a very tough one when asked to lead, in the All-Star Mile.How to play it: Cosmic Force. 4. Colette was a dominant winner of the Adrian Knox and while she has yet to face a filly with the class of 1. Probabeel, she couldn’t have done much more to press in her Oaks claims in her past three starts. Profiles like she’ll relish the 2400m and Glen Boss should be able to land her forward of midfield. If she shows the same acceleration over the trip, and confident she will given the Knox was a good test being so genuinely run, just can’t see anything coming from behind her to run her down, which is what lies ahead for Probabeel. Probabeel beat Funstar first-up landing her first group 1 then ran second to that filly with Quick Thinker in third. Opie Bosson is six from eight aboard his fellow Kiwi. 9. Quintessa best smokey.How to play it: Colette to win. The Sydney Cup is no stranger to a blowout and 11. Sweet Thomas would be one of epic proportions. The eight-year-old comes through the right lead-up races, running seventh in the Manion Cup last start (finishing alongside Raheen House), but wasn’t suited by the sit-sprint set-up of that race nor the Randwick City Cup the start prior. A truly-run race here could see some big form reversals. He plummets to 51kg and four of the past five winners of the Sydney Cup have carried 52kg or less. It’s such a big advantage over the two-mile slog. The last time Sweet Thomas won a race he trounced his rivals in the German St Leger over 2800m with 60kg. If you’re still not convinced, check out his recent tickover trial where he smoked to the line. As the market suggests,2. Young Rascal is the horse to beat dropping 3kg despite winning the Manion Cup so impressively.How to play it: Sweet Thomas each-way. 2. Addeybb was outstanding in winning the group 1 Ranvet fighting back to beat 12. Verry Elleegant. They crawled in the early stages of the race with Tom Marquand clicking Addeybb up at the 800m. The six-year-old sustained his sprint right through the line, clocking the fastest last-200m section across the entire meeting. That was on a soft 5, he is even better on wetter ground. Tactics will be interesting from the inside draw as Addeybb profiles as a horse that needs galloping room to click through his gears. Verry Elleegant has the grounding of a 2400m run where she gave her rivals a galloping lesson in the Tancred but loses James McDonald who jumps on 1. Danon Premium, a Japanese import who oozes class. Has never raced on anything other than firm and good tracks. That’s the gamble. A firm track he’d be clearly on top. 10. Master Of Wine is a group 1 winner in waiting.How to play it: Addeybb to win. 17. Funstar had her Oaks mission aborted after she failed in the Vinery Stud Stakes over 2000m last start but Foxplay in 2017 and Alizee in 2018 both ran fourth in the Vinery before winning this race. There is a lot of speed engaged here which will give James McDonald the opportunity to settle the daughter of Adelaide in the second half, get her to drop her head and savage the line. She handles the wet and certainly won’t mind getting back to Randwick given her record at the track (5:3-2-0). 2. Nettoyer bloused her rivals to win the Doncaster Mile last Saturday with 51.5kg on her back. Gets back to weight-for-age now but is against her own sex.  7. Danzdanzdance is in the most suitable race she has found all campaign. The wetter the better.How to play it: Funstar to win. 14. Bangkok is flying and threatens to win a race at big odds. The five-year-old has found a very deep group 2 mares’ race but if she can settle closer and still produce the same turn of foot, she can win. First-up she didn’t get the clearest passage home but was rattling to the line behind 7. Fasika and subsequent Galaxy winner 1. Am Excited. They are both single-figure odds here. If 3. Savatiano produces her best, she’ll win.How to play it: Bangkok to win.

This is always a tricky race to assess with the two-year-olds tackling the mile for the first time but happy to take a punt on Dundeel colt  3. Azaly. The Hayes and Dabernig yard have won the past two Fernhills (Power Scheme and Futooh) and it’s obviously been some kind of target race for Azaly given he has trialled in Sydney since his eye-catching Bendigo debut over 1100m back in late February. In his Randwick trial Azaly led and although Tom Marquand, who rides the horse here too, had to shake him up, there was a response as he split Ole Kirk and Rulership. 1. Postcode did a big job at Hawkesbury last Saturday lumping 62kg to win on a heavy 9 over 1300m. The Baillieu has provided two of the past four winners of this race and race favourite 2. Untamed ran second to Holyfield in it this year.How to play it: Azaly each-way. Queen Elizabeth Stakes top pick Danon Premium is unproven on a soft or worse surface.  Credit:AAP 9.

The day finally comes with the Sydney Cup at Randwick on Saturday. The son of Animal Kingdom hasn’t won since the Derby, nor has he run a place, but this has been a long-held target. Angel Of Truth ready to stay the two miles of the Sydney Cup.Credit:Getty Images “I always thought he would make a two-mile horse because he is tough,” Markwell said. “He has been going all right this prep and his last run he showed just how tough he is. “He just kept coming last week and he has had a good week at home. ""This race has been the plan for him since the spring and everything points to him running well."" Angel Of Truth never got on the track in the Chairman’s Handicap as he didn’t have the speed to get to the front but after being three wide was kicking on for fifth at the post. It was his best effort since his Derby win and he remains well-respected in the Sydney Cup market at $11, where English stayer Young Rascal is the $2.45 BetEasy favourite. Sam Clipperton takes over from Glen Boss and it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Angel Of Truth back leading like he did in his Tulloch Stakes and Derby wins last year. “His toughness is probably his best asset, so he will be up there and I think he will run the trip right out,” Markwell said. “The English horse looks pretty good but I think we'll run a good race, especially if the track is soft.” The Kembla Grange trainer also has Electric Girl in the Provincial Championships, which is owned in the same interests as Angel Of Truth by Ross Williams’s Superhorse syndicate. The three-year-old filly has to take on the older horses but is riding a winning run of three, including her 1400m Provincial Championships heat victory where she ran a track record at Kembla. “It is a big task for a filly against these horses but she is very good,” Markwell said. “She will need to get the right run but she has a fair bit of class.""
