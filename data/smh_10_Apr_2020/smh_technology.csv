But this isn't exactly what the services where designed for, with the former emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online and the latter optimised for business meetings. Replay   While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, here are some tips to stay safe. This is a mobile-focused video chat app for iOS, Android and computers which was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games in the middle of last year.  It wasn't especially well known until everyone started looking for a good way to catch up with their friends virtually from isolation. Houseparty is  a straightforward app that connects up to eight people at a time for video hangouts and simple games, without many settings or advanced features, but there are still a few things you should look out for. Friends are added by entering in their exact username or allowing the app to look through your contacts or Facebook friends. If you allow the app to see your location, you can also request to be friends with people physically near you (kind of moot during a global shutdown). Because you're likely to end up with a very diverse list of friends, it's important to get to know the ""lock"" feature. Hitting the padlock once a chat's going makes it so nobody else can drop in without asking. By default, people using Houseparty can see when their friends are in a room and will be able to barge right in, so you could conceivably end up in a chat with friends of friends you don't know. If you never want to be in an open room like this, you can enable private mode in settings to automatically lock every room you're in. As its name suggests Houseparty was designed for casual, open gatherings. Houseparty has become a popular app for school-aged kids who want to keep up with friends from home. If you're worried about your child using Houseparty you should make sure they know to use the lock or private mode options, and that they're only adding people they know personally. Houseparty is a less scary service than many in this sense, because you can essentially only add people you know, but if you don't lock the rooms or if you're playing fast and loose accepting Facebook friend requests it could still get dicey. Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. Finally, there were rumours circulating last month that installing Houseparty allowed hackers to take control of your other accounts including Spotify and even banks. This is very likely not the case. The Houseparty app only asks for permissions it needs (microphone and camera, plus optionally contacts, Facebook or location), and there's no indication it has suffered any kind of data breach. Focused less on socialising and more on remote conferencing for businesses and schools, Zoom has also seen a massive uptick in users since social isolation measures began, with the company behind the service saying there are now 200 million people using it, up from 10 million just weeks ago. This is a much more versatile program with a lot of features and settings, which is great for general business use but has caused some issues now that there are 20 times more people on board. Potential weaknesses in Zoom's encryption standards have seen companies, including NASA and more recently Google banning their employees from using Zoom when working from home. While iffy encryption is a serious concern for secretive businesses and government agencies, most regular folk don't need to worry as much. You should be more concerned with locking down your settings to block out scammers and interlopers.

Credit:Twitter/@BorisJohnson By default Zoom trades quite a bit of security for increased convenience, and while the company has been working to strike a better balance since reports of ""Zoombombing"" started making international headlines, there are still several things you should do. By default you need a meeting ID and a password to join a Zoom call, and making sure you only distribute these to the people you actually want to join is the most important step to prevent uninvited guests, or Zoombombers. Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. You also have the option of sending a Zoom URL, which combines the ID and password so users can join the meeting in a single click. This is the most convenient option, but not the safest. Aside from making it easier for an invitation to fall into the wrong hands, it also encourages people to click apparent Zoom URLs that land in their email inbox, which are increasingly being used by scammers to steal personal info. To be safe, distribute meeting IDs and passwords instead. Attendees can enter these in the Zoom app or website to access a meeting. Every Zoom user also has a personal meeting ID, which other users can use to connect directly to you at any time. Think of it like your own office, where people you know can drop by unannounced. You have the option to use this ID when setting up meetings, but from a security standpoint that's a bad idea. Stick to generating new, randomised meeting IDs each time, and prevent your personal ID from being published on the internet in any capacity. And just in case, despite your best efforts, someone dodgy does make it into your Zoom chat, there are a couple of settings in your profile you should change from the defaults to limit the potential damage. Specifically, make it so that only the host (i.e. you) can share their screen, and turn off file transfers. If you are Zoombombed, the last thing you want is for your meeting to become an impromptu pornography party, or for the scammer on the other end to start distributing malware.

4,/technology/video-games/animal-crossing-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-a-life-indoors-20200407-p54huz.html,Animal Crossing is the perfect antidote to a life indoors,"With its open-ended DIY village simulation and a never-ending stream of laid-back challenges, Animal Crossing New Horizons offers daily doses of an irrepressibly happy virtual life in the slow lane. It might sound morbid (and it was certainly by coincidence), but Nintendo could not possibly have picked a better time than during a global pandemic to release this latest entry in its long-running series of quirky life sims. Your island starts basic, but can become as complex as you like. With the real world filled with uncertainty and viewed mostly from the isolation of our homes, who doesn't want to get away to a magical island where your biggest decision is whether to go fishing or bug hunting, and where even getting stung by wasps is a charming experience? This is by far the nicest iteration of the game to date, with both more guided objectives and more options for self-led tomfoolery, wrapped in a much higher definition version of the familiar rustic-meets-plushies visual and audio motifs. When you first arrive on the deserted island there isn't a whole lot to do other than clean up branches and weeds on the small patch of land you have access to, catch fish and chill out. But every day that argyle-vest-wearing business racoon Tom Nook will introduce new elements — a museum to house your fossils and fish, a store to barter in — and eventually your island will become a village. A new 'Nook Miles' system that rewards you with points for achieving certain goals is an excellent guide if you're looking for something to do, but for the most part you're free to follow your heart here. Work towards expanding your house and filling it with all your favourite things, propagate flowers and fruit trees, or spend time hanging out with the bizarre animal villagers your little town attracts. Brand new touches like the ability to learn crafting recipes and make items from collected resources makes for a much more satisfying and less capitalist vibe than previous games, while the late-game ability to totally terraform your island will be thrilling for perfectionists. Creative types will find endless opportunities to customise and build on their town — from designing your own garments or zen gardens to completely overhauling what your main strip's cobblestones look like — while social players will find it easier than ever (though still not seamless) to visit each other's towns over the internet and compare turnip prices. Like other games in the series, the content in New Horizons is tied to the real world clock and calendar. If it's 4pm in the real world it's 4pm on your island. If it's April your village will be visited by a frankly disturbing rabbit who's hidden eggs all over the place. For the first time this all lines up nicely with the southern hemisphere too, with seasonally appropriate weather, bugs and fish. As a result you may find there's a limit to what you can do in a single day, with resources like wood needing time to regenerate. But then this is a game designed to play for a few hours a day, not in marathon sessions, and the many deep sub systems and seasonal approach to content and challenges means you could be dipping in for years to come.

6,/technology/latest-vive-vr-set-is-slick-but-vexing-20200406-p54hg2.html,Latest Vive VR set is slick but vexing,"HTC's original Vive headset was a groundbreaking product that helped shape virtual reality as we know it today. Shipping with motion controllers for hand tracking and room scale for player movement, the Vive set a high bar for consumer VR that left rivals playing catch-up. But a lot has changed in three years and, despite some notable improvements over the original, HTC's first true successor to the Vive — the Cosmos — ultimately falls short of its rivals. The $1299 Vive Cosmos is the latest in the line of tethered PC-based VR headsets, slotting somewhere between the more affordable $649 Oculus Rift S and the premium $1600 Valve Index which is yet to make its way to Australia. You get a great display, top notch build quality, a super comfortable design, excellent audio with the built-in headphones, strong ecosystem of supported accessories and a unique modular faceplate system that allows you to alter the headset's capabilities. The Vive Cosmos is a slick VR headset, with a few flaws. However, the tracking out of the box is the weakest of the bunch and the bulky controllers are a step behind the competition, making the high asking price difficult to justify. The headset itself looks like a piece of tech from the future with a slick dark blue and black aesthetic punctuated with hollow triangles all over the front faceplate. The headset has more heft to it and overall looks and feels like it can take more of a beating than its competitors. A welcome addition is that you can effortlessly flip up the screen away from your eyes to converse with someone in the real world; an extremely useful feature that I hope makes its way to other VR headsets in the future. Unfortunately, though the display is faster and higher resolution than the Rift S,  it has a very small sweet spot to the point that I found myself having to regularly adjust it so my eyes lined up. Like the Rift S, the Cosmos uses 'inside-out tracking' where the cameras on the headset are used to track the movement of the headset and the controllers, ditching the need for external base stations and making setup much easier. However I found HTC's tracking solution not as accurate or as consistent as those found on Oculus' headsets. The Cosmos would sometimes lose tracking when I reached for something on the floor and, while it had no issues in keeping up with fast-paced rhythm games like Beat Saber and Audica, bringing the controllers closer to my eyes for a reloading action in Arizona Sunshine would cause my virtual hands to float and drift for a while. HTC does offer an upgrade path for Cosmos owners looking for the best tracking possible, but it means investing in an expensive SteamVR tracking faceplate as well as external trackers. One of the main selling points of the Vive ecosystem is that it gives you access to HTC's wireless adapter (sold separately for $479) which, as the name suggests, makes the Cosmos completely wireless. I had a chance to test it out and I was blown away by the fact that I didn't even notice a difference in performance going from wired to wireless. It essentially gives you the freedom of an Oculus Quest with a roughly equivalent battery life of three hours, but with the full power of your PC behind it. However the cost of the Cosmos, adapter and PC together is significant. Overall, the Cosmos is a strong headset on many fronts that is ultimately let down by inconsistent tracking and an eye watering price tag.

8,/technology/video-games/providing-a-virtual-playground-with-online-games-at-home-20200408-p54iam.html,Providing a virtual playground with online games at home,"The Polish government is setting up Minecraft servers for children trapped at home during the coronavirus lockdown, as the internet becomes the virtual school playground in the age of social distancing. Each day, the Polish government plans to publish new educational challenges to keep children entertained while exercising their brains, including logic puzzles, game development webinars and Minecraft building competitions with prizes. Minecraft is a great virtual playground that kids and adults can explore together online. I've undertaken a similar project in my neighbourhood, obviously on a somewhat smaller scale, creating an online Minecraft server open to my two teenagers and the neighbourhood children. This way they can all play in the same Minecraft world even when they're not in the same house and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. While the kids are playing, they can also run a separate Skype voice call on speakerphone, so they can talk as if they were sitting in the same room. It's more social than just staring at the screen. I created an online Minecraft PE server which the children can all access via their iPads, but there are other options such as a Minecraft Realms subscription. Every game is different, so if you're looking to do something similar with your friends then you need to consider the games they want to play, the devices they have at their disposal and how much you all want to spend. Some games are ""cross platform""; for example my kids are using our PlayStation 4 to play Rocket League online against the next door neighbours who have an Xbox One. To play against each other online we needed to sign up for the PlayStation Plus subscription and they needed an Xbox Live Gold membership. Once again, there's plenty of cheering and trash-talking via Skype while they play. Meanwhile, my son is also playing Portal 2 with his friend two doors up. They purchased the game via the Steam online games store, which makes it easy to connect with other players online. He's also created a Discord server —it's basically Skype for gamers — so he can stay in touch with his school friends until they're all back in the classroom.

10,/technology/home-truths-the-lesson-to-be-learned-from-workers-in-isolation-20200407-p54hwq.html,Home truths: the lesson to be learned from workers in isolation,"It is hard to find positives as we come to terms with the coronavirus and its impact on society. Every parent I know is struggling to keep their children happy, healthy and entertained. Close friends have seen their income suddenly disappear, and the enormous lines around Centrelink offices are heartbreaking. And, of course, many people will get sick and many will die. So I'm not trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation, but I do think there is a silver lining from this great disruption to our lives. Like many people reading this I'm now working from home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do from almost anywhere, as long as I have an internet connected computer. This has been true for a decade, but for a decade I've spent the majority of my working hours in an office. The question is why? Working from home has its limits and challenges, but there are also great opportunities. Well, for a start, humans are social creatures. We enjoy the camaraderie of the office and bouncing ideas off each other, and as annoying as the people you shared your cubicle with might have been you're probably missing them right now. So I'm not expecting this forced work from home experiment to revolutionise the workplace, but I am hoping it will normalise working from home. Over the last decade I've worked in truly flexible workplaces that treated their employees as adults, and in workplaces that talked a big game when it came to flexibility but in reality were only as flexible as each manager allowed. In my experience the flexible corporations had happier, more productive staff, and I would guess those workplaces are coping with the lockdown far better than the companies that made its employees feel guilty whenever they asked to work from home. Adults have lives and responsibilities outside the office. Too many organisations ignore this fact and end up with employees spending hours sitting in an office chair, whose minds are elsewhere, stressing over who will pick the kids up from daycare, or when they'll get a chance to do the laundry. This has to change. My day job is tech support, so I know many people aren't experiencing a great introduction to working from home; not just because their kids aren't interested in that 10am Zoom check-in. For years, the default assumption of many workplace IT departments was that you'd only ever connect to the services you need from a hardwired Windows desktop within the walls of your company. Suddenly, we're asking employees to connect over a VPN to a thin client, and install this or that certificate, with accounts IT have locked down. We never trained employees to navigate these systems from home, and most IT technicians have never experienced the road blocks our users are facing, because we've always given ourselves super user status. This also has to change. In the last two weeks of enforced work from home, I've seen these assumptions questioned for the first time. I'm hoping this will bring about real change. We have an opportunity to redefine white collar work, if not revolutionise it. The benefits could be enormous if we all worked from home one or two days a week; happier, more productive employees, less stressed parents, fewer cars on the road during peak hour.

11,/technology/home-truths-the-lesson-to-be-learned-from-workers-in-isolation-20200407-p54hwq.html,Home truths: the lesson to be learned from workers in isolation,"It is hard to find positives as we come to terms with the coronavirus and its impact on society. Every parent I know is struggling to keep their children happy, healthy and entertained. Close friends have seen their income suddenly disappear, and the enormous lines around Centrelink offices are heartbreaking. And, of course, many people will get sick and many will die. So I'm not trying to downplay the seriousness of the situation, but I do think there is a silver lining from this great disruption to our lives. Like many people reading this I'm now working from home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do from almost anywhere, as long as I have an internet connected computer. This has been true for a decade, but for a decade I've spent the majority of my working hours in an office. The question is why? Working from home has its limits and challenges, but there are also great opportunities. Well, for a start, humans are social creatures. We enjoy the camaraderie of the office and bouncing ideas off each other, and as annoying as the people you shared your cubicle with might have been you're probably missing them right now. So I'm not expecting this forced work from home experiment to revolutionise the workplace, but I am hoping it will normalise working from home. Over the last decade I've worked in truly flexible workplaces that treated their employees as adults, and in workplaces that talked a big game when it came to flexibility but in reality were only as flexible as each manager allowed. In my experience the flexible corporations had happier, more productive staff, and I would guess those workplaces are coping with the lockdown far better than the companies that made its employees feel guilty whenever they asked to work from home. Adults have lives and responsibilities outside the office. Too many organisations ignore this fact and end up with employees spending hours sitting in an office chair, whose minds are elsewhere, stressing over who will pick the kids up from daycare, or when they'll get a chance to do the laundry. This has to change. My day job is tech support, so I know many people aren't experiencing a great introduction to working from home; not just because their kids aren't interested in that 10am Zoom check-in. For years, the default assumption of many workplace IT departments was that you'd only ever connect to the services you need from a hardwired Windows desktop within the walls of your company. Suddenly, we're asking employees to connect over a VPN to a thin client, and install this or that certificate, with accounts IT have locked down. We never trained employees to navigate these systems from home, and most IT technicians have never experienced the road blocks our users are facing, because we've always given ourselves super user status. This also has to change. In the last two weeks of enforced work from home, I've seen these assumptions questioned for the first time. I'm hoping this will bring about real change. We have an opportunity to redefine white collar work, if not revolutionise it. The benefits could be enormous if we all worked from home one or two days a week; happier, more productive employees, less stressed parents, fewer cars on the road during peak hour. I hope we don't miss the chance, and return to business as usual, whenever that may be. Peter Wells works at Swinburne University and is a technology commentator in his spare time.

""We have been working around the clock to ensure that all of our users — new and old, large and small — can stay in touch and continue running businesses during these times"". The US-based company's video conferencing service has surged in popularity since March, becoming the go-to option for millions of people forced to work and socialise from home amid the Coronavirus pandemic.But the newfound popularity has led to increased scrutiny on some of the service's existing issues, new use cases the company never predicted, and brand new problems owing to unexpected stress on the technology. Dr Ritesh Chugh, discipline lead in information systems and analysis at Central Queensland University, warned the sudden influx of new Zoom users has not only resulted in poor security practices — such as the posting of meeting details on social media or failing to use privacy settings — but also exposed existing flaws in the service. ""There is no doubt as the number of users have increased rapidly these issues have come to the forefront ... and Zoom has to ramp up the privacy and security it offers its users,"" he said. Replay   ""For organisations like SpaceX and NASA to discontinue the use of Zoom speaks volumes in itself but users also need to ramp up their privacy settings, and ensure a safe virtual environment for everyone."" One of the most visible side effects of Zoom's popularity has been the rise of ""Zoom bombers"", or gatecrashers who show up unexpectedly in video conferences. Some have reportedly invaded chats to abuse users, insert pornographic content or share malicious files, while comedian Hamish Blake has been encouraging users to secretly forward him meeting details so he could surprise participants. Over the weekend the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab published research critical of many of Zoom's security features, which it said were designed to remove friction from the video conferencing experience at the potential expense of confidentiality. Though Zoom's ease of use may have made it attractive to its many new users, Citizen Lab warns it may not be suitable for users requiring privacy such as governments, health care providers, activists, lawyers and journalists.

One of Citizen's Lab's chief concerns was Zoom's custom encryption methods, which it says have ""significant weaknesses"". While Zoom had previously claimed to use ""end to end encryption"", implying that interception of a call between two parties was mathematically impossible, Citizen's Lab found the keys could in fact be intercepted in some scenarios. The researchers also found that some data from their test calls — including encryption keys — was routed through Chinese servers. Since Zoom has hundreds of developers in China making its software, the researchers suggested the company could be susceptible to pressure from the country's government to facilitate spying. Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a response that the routing through China was an error caused by the company's haste to add more capacity as demand grew. Ordinarily data may move to other regions during times of extremely high traffic, but China is supposed to be ""geo-fenced"" so that data from non-Chinese users does not go there. He says the error was corrected on April 2. Before the Citizen's Lab report, in a blog post on April 1, Zoom apologised for incorrectly suggesting its product utilised end-to-end encryption.

The eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant said there was a 40 per cent increase in reports over the past three weeks, compared with the previous 12-month weekly average. Reports of image-based abuse had increased by about 86 per cent, while reports about cyber-bullying of children were up 21 per cent. eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant speaking at a conference in February.Credit:Janie Barrett ""It is concerning because we're so early on in the pandemic,"" Ms Inman Grant said.

""As children are exploring their sexuality and aren't seeing the teenage love of their life, we're expecting them to seek out more pornography … and to be engaging in more sexting and sending nudes."" Ms Inman Grant urged parents to use parental controls, secure passwords, develop family screen policies, and encourage children including teenagers to use their devices in common areas of the house. Research from eSafety in 2019 suggests the average teenager spends 38 hours a week on screens outside school hours.

To date, governments, medical experts and the media have used location data from transport apps such as CityMapper, which shows how people move throughout cities like Sydney and Melbourne using public transport, in an attempt to determine whether people's movement has reduced. Mobile phone location data can be used to track the movement of people.Credit:Robert Rough But such data is limited in its use as it relies on active usage of one app alone - an app that isn't necessarily used by a large percentage of Australians.

Mobile phone location data of millions of users from one of Australia's telco providers, however, can provide a clearer picture. In a statement to the Sun-Herald and Sunday Age, Vodafone Australia's director of corporate affairs, Dan Lloyd, said the telco had ""provided, on request, aggregated network information to the NSW Department of Customer Service and the federal Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet"". ""This information simply shows the total number of subscribers in various areas at points in time,"" Mr Lloyd said. ""This information can help show trends in population movements immediately before and after the lockdown measures with the aim of assisting in the reduction of the spread of COVID-19."" When asked by a journalist a week ago whether he would follow the British government, which is using such data from telcos to track whether Britons are following lockdown laws, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""the Australian government isn't doing that."" ""What I want to be clear about is the policies and measures that we will put in place for Australia will be right for Australia,"" Mr Morrison said last Sunday. ""They'll understand how Australia works and how Australia thinks and what our rules are and what our society understands and accepts. Our values. That's what we will do in Australia.""

""This data can provide a picture of the effectiveness of measures taken to address the COVID-19 crisis generally,"" the spokesperson said, adding that ""no personal information has been provided to PM&C by any telecommunications company nor was it requested"".

18,/technology/zoom-video-conferencing-apps-under-privacy-commissioner-s-microscope-20200403-p54gsk.html,"Zoom, video conferencing apps under privacy commissioner's microscope","Privacy authorities are poised to crack down on video and teleconferencing apps including Zoom that have soared in popularity during social distancing amid a global storm about privacy breaches. Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk warned of ""new risks to privacy"", saying providers needed to be transparent about how they handle personal information, make their controls user-friendly and build in privacy and security ""by default"". There has been global concern about security over Zoom, which is now recording up to 200 million daily users, up from 10 million in December, as the world works from home due to the coronavirus. International media has been publishing sustained coverage of Zoom's alleged privacy deficiencies. In the US, the FBI said it had received multiple reports of meetings being gatecrashed (or ""Zoom bombed"") by uninvited visitors with pornographic images or threatening language. One built-in feature, called ""attention tracking"", displays an icon next to the name of participants who haven't had Zoom in focus for 30 seconds or more, allowing bosses to see whether attendees are paying attention. On Thursday, inquiries by The New York Times prompted Zoom to begin removing a feature that allowed people to access LinkedIn profile data about other users without their knowledge. Investigating: Australian Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk. In addition to fears about improper encryption, users have raised concerns about the chat feature, with ""private"" conversations being recorded and saved in the meetings' minutes. Ms Falk said video and tele-conferencing services could be highly beneficial but warned ""they can also pose new risks to privacy"". ""[My office] is considering any privacy impacts arising with the increased use of these technologies and whether any regulatory action is required. ""Organisations that shift to using new mediums for doing business need to replicate, as far as possible, privacy and security measures that would apply in their regular environment."" A Zoom spokesperson said a meeting host is only able to record private chats which they participate in; hosts cannot see private messages between non-host attendees of Zoom meetings. However, experts say the feature still poses a threat to privacy, as hosts could later share the data with others or upload it to the cloud. E-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the booming popularity of videoconferencingplatforms including Zoom, Skype and Houseparty meant it was important users took steps to protect their privacy.

19,/technology/zoom-video-conferencing-apps-under-privacy-commissioner-s-microscope-20200403-p54gsk.html,"Zoom, video conferencing apps under privacy commissioner's microscope","Privacy authorities are poised to crack down on video and teleconferencing apps including Zoom that have soared in popularity during social distancing amid a global storm about privacy breaches. Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk warned of ""new risks to privacy"", saying providers needed to be transparent about how they handle personal information, make their controls user-friendly and build in privacy and security ""by default"". There has been global concern about security over Zoom, which is now recording up to 200 million daily users, up from 10 million in December, as the world works from home due to the coronavirus. International media has been publishing sustained coverage of Zoom's alleged privacy deficiencies. In the US, the FBI said it had received multiple reports of meetings being gatecrashed (or ""Zoom bombed"") by uninvited visitors with pornographic images or threatening language. One built-in feature, called ""attention tracking"", displays an icon next to the name of participants who haven't had Zoom in focus for 30 seconds or more, allowing bosses to see whether attendees are paying attention. On Thursday, inquiries by The New York Times prompted Zoom to begin removing a feature that allowed people to access LinkedIn profile data about other users without their knowledge. Investigating: Australian Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk. In addition to fears about improper encryption, users have raised concerns about the chat feature, with ""private"" conversations being recorded and saved in the meetings' minutes. Ms Falk said video and tele-conferencing services could be highly beneficial but warned ""they can also pose new risks to privacy"". ""[My office] is considering any privacy impacts arising with the increased use of these technologies and whether any regulatory action is required. ""Organisations that shift to using new mediums for doing business need to replicate, as far as possible, privacy and security measures that would apply in their regular environment."" A Zoom spokesperson said a meeting host is only able to record private chats which they participate in; hosts cannot see private messages between non-host attendees of Zoom meetings. However, experts say the feature still poses a threat to privacy, as hosts could later share the data with others or upload it to the cloud. E-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the booming popularity of videoconferencingplatforms including Zoom, Skype and Houseparty meant it was important users took steps to protect their privacy. ""Nude gatecrashing, cyber flashing and other forms of online abuse can happen on any video conferencing service providing instantaneous interactivity but not all platforms have incorporated 'safety by design' into these services.
