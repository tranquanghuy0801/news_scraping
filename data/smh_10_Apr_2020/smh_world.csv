Meanwhile, religious leaders around the globe on Thursday urged people to celebrate Good Friday and Easter from the safety of their homes.

Across Europe, where Easter is one of the busiest travel times of the year, authorities set up roadblocks and otherwise discouraged family gatherings. A spike in deaths in Britain and New York and surges of reported new infections in Japan and in India's congested cities made it clear the battle is far from over. In over developments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved out of intensive care after three days. The 55-year-old leader had taken a turn for the worse early this week. New York state reported 799 more dead, its third straight day of record-high fatalities. More than 7000 people have died in the state, accounting for almost half the US death toll of around 16,000.

He said hospitals are standing up to the strain so far and the onslaught of patients has not been as big as feared. Worldwide, the number of dead rose past 90,000 and confirmed infections reached about 1.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed much higher, in part because of different rules for counting the dead and cover-ups by some governments. Numbers released on Thursday by the world's largest economy showed that 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that. That amounts to about 1 in 10 US workers, the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since record-keeping began in 1948. The real numbers could be even higher because state unemployment offices around the country have been overwhelmed with claims, and some people have been unable to get through by telephone or website. And still more job cuts are expected. The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent - a number last seen at the tail end of the Depression. Xian Chang, whose Cafe China and two other New York restaurants normally employ around 150 people, said only about 40 are working. One restaurant is closed, the others are offering takeout only, and workers aren't coming in, in some cases because they are sick or afraid. ""Frankly, we are losing money every day we're open,"" he said. Sharon Bridgeman, 57, of Kansas City, Missouri, was laid off from her job two weeks ago at a nonprofit that helps homeless people and is still waiting to be approved for unemployment benefits. ""I'm worried I may not have a job to go back to,"" she said. ""I'm also worried about the people I work with."" In the US, the Federal Reserve announced it will provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in loans targeted toward both households and businesses. In Europe, finance ministers from the 19-nation euro zone were set to make another attempt on Thursday to agree on measures to help the bloc weather the crisis. In many European countries, where the social safety nets tend to be stronger than in the US, government programs that subsidise workers' pay are keeping millions of people on payrolls in places like Germany and France, though typically with fewer hours and at lower wages. The United Nations' labour organisation said the equivalent of 195 million full- time jobs could be lost in the second quarter, while the aid organisation Oxfam International estimated half a billion people worldwide could be pushed into poverty if wealthier nations do not take urgent action. Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse, Japan, the world's third-largest economy, and France are all, like the US, either in a recession or feared headed for one. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top American infectious-diseases expert, shot down hopes that warmer spring weather would bring an end to the crisis. ""One should not assume that we are going to be rescued by a change in the weather,"" he said. ""You must assume that the virus will continue to do its thing."" Amid widespread restrictions on public gatherings, major religious denominations are holding virtual services where members can watch on TV, online or on their phones. Others are holding services at drive-in theatres, where people can stay in their cars. Instead of Easter egg hunts, there are virtual events where children seek out hidden items on YouTube. The virus ""doesn't take a day off for Good Friday or Easter Sunday,"" said Archbishop John Wester of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Still, other churches plan to move ahead with Easter, especially in states like Texas, where the governor declared religious gatherings ""essential services."" A Houston church has installed hand-washing stations and rearranged the 1000-person sanctuary to hold about 100 people with 6 or more feet between them. Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside. In England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video. The British government is running ads urging people to ""Stay Home, Save Lives"" over the weekend. German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasised that ""even short trips inside Germany, to the seaside or the mountains or relatives, can't happen over Easter."" The Dutch prime minister said border crossings with Germany and Belgium could be closed if there is too much traffic. New Zealand police warned people not to drive to vacation homes over Easter and risk arrest. Greece also tightened restrictions ahead of next week's Orthodox Easter, increasing roadblocks, doubling fines for lockdown violations and banning travel between islands. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested mass gatherings may be barred through the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which runs from late April through most of May. Indonesia's president banned civil servants, police officers, military personnel and employees of state-owned companies from returning to their hometowns to celebrate the end of Ramadan. New infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off in hard-hit Italy and Spain, which together have around 33,000 deaths, but the daily tolls are still shocking. Spain reported 683 more dead, bringing its total to more than 15,200. Britain recorded 881 new deaths, for a total of close to 8000. Japan recorded more than 500 new cases for the first time, a worrisome rise since it has the world's oldest population and COVID-19 can be especially serious in the elderly. For most, the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms like fever and cough. But for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia. About 350,000 people have recovered, by Johns Hopkins' count. AP Copyright © 2020", Michelle R. Smith ,"April 10, 2020"

10,/world/north-america/this-is-how-america-s-coronavirus-response-went-wrong-20200409-p54ii6.html,This is how America's coronavirus response went wrong,"Washington: The view that the United States is an exceptional nation has long been central to the country's self-image. Ronald Reagan famously described America as ""a shining city upon a hill"". Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's secretary of state, called it ""the indispensable nation"". Replay   ""To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation,"" former Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee said in 2009. But the belief in American exceptionalism has taken a battering in recent years. The Iraq War, the global financial crisis, regular mass shootings, entrenched poverty and the rise of China have shaken the country's sense of superiority. When it came to combating COVID-19, however, there were still good reasons to believe America would stand above the rest of the world. The country is home to many of the world's leading medical experts, pharmaceutical companies and public health institutions. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index - a detailed study published by Johns Hopkins University and the Nuclear Threat Initiative - judged the US better placed than any other nation to respond to a pandemic or epidemic. But that's not how things have turned out. The Trump administration moved quickly to restrict arrivals from China, but did little to prevent the spread of the virus domestically. Donald Trump spent weeks downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus as it was spreading through the US.Credit:Bloomberg The virus is now killing almost 2000 Americans each day - more than anywhere else in the world. Almost 16,000 people have died in the US after contracting the virus, putting it second only to Italy. Rather than affirming American exceptionalism, the pandemic has fed into a narrative of American decline. ""Long before COVID-19 ravaged the earth, there had already been a precipitous decline in the appeal of the American model,"" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. ""The federal government’s slow, incoherent, and all too often ineffective response to the pandemic will reinforce the already widespread view that the United States has lost its way."" On January 30, Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's top trade adviser, wrote a memo warning that the coronavirus could create a pandemic. In late February, he wrote a second memo saying the virus could kill up to 2 million Americans. On the day Navarro sent his first memo, Trump was assuring Americans that everything would be fine. ""We think we have it very well under control,"" the President said. A few days later Trump said the number of cases in the US would soon be ""down to zero"". As late as March 6, he was favourably comparing the coronavirus to the regular flu. Trump's relaxed rhetoric set the tone for Republican politicians and prominent media figures. It was not until March 17 that the President publicly grasped the seriousness of the virus, describing it as a highly contagious ""invisible enemy"" and announcing tough social distancing guidelines. At the state and local level, some leaders have been more proactive than others. San Francisco implemented a stay-at-home order on March 16. Despite being the country's second most densely-populated city, it has only recorded 10 deaths from the virus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo didn't issue a similar order until a week later. The virus was already running rampant in his state, but that was only beginning to become clear. The signature failure of the US response to the coronavirus was the slow rollout of mass testing. Because of technical glitches and bureaucratic bungling, the US was flying blind as the virus spread through the country in February and early March. Instead of using a test developed by the World Health Organisation, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opted to develop its own test. This wasn't particularly unusual. It’s common for nations with strong scientific expertise to develop their own diagnostics. The CDC was indeed able to quickly develop a viable coronavirus test, but struggled to ramp up production. When it started sending out test kits to public health laboratories in early February, problems emerged immediately. Trial runs produced inconclusive results in more than half the labs, meaning the tests couldn’t be relied upon. The CDC implemented a workaround solution, which required the labs to send tests back to the organisation's headquarters in Atlanta. This resulted in days-long delays. By mid-February, the nation was testing only about 100 samples per day. Top researchers at prestigious universities were also hindered in their efforts to roll out their own COVID-19 tests. On January 31 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. It was an important declaration but had unintended consequences. Hospitals and private laboratories that usually face minimal federal regulation were now subject to new rules that required them to obtain permission from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) before using their own tests. It wasn't until late February that the FDA relaxed its rules and allowed certain laboratories to develop and use their own tests before authorisation.

Both countries recorded their first case of COVID-19 on January 20. By the middle of March, South Korea had conducted 290,000 coronavirus tests. At that time the US had only performed an estimated 60,000. The difference is even more damning when you take into account that the US population is seven times larger than South Korea's. Asked about the testing shortage at a congressional hearing in March, Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said: ""It is a failing, let's admit it."" The pace of testing has increased dramatically over recent weeks. Around 100,000 people are now being tested each day. But the surge came too late to identify emerging hotspots such as New York. For frontline health workers in the US, the biggest concern during the pandemic has been the dire lack of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Hospital staff have held protests outside hospitals pleading for more protective gear. In New York, Broadway costume designers have been sewing masks to donate to hospital workers. Some nurses have been wearing bin bags over their scrubs, while doctors have resorted to wearing ski goggles. Skiers and snowboarders are asked to donate goggles for medical use outside a ski shop in Vermont. Credit:GogglesForDocs Countries around the world have struggled to secure medical supplies, but in the US the problem has been exacerbated by government failures. Trump was slow to invoke the Defence Production Act, a law that allows him to order private companies to manufacture supplies necessary for a national emergency. An official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the ventilator supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. And the lack of planning and co-ordination from the federal government has forced states to compete for vital supplies. This has driven up prices and led to what has been dubbed a ""Wild West"" environment for procurement. The Chicago Sun-Times reported on the remarkable example of officials in Illinois who tracked down a supply of 1.5 million N95 respirator masks in China through a middleman. One day before they expected to complete the purchase, the officials got a call from the supplier saying he had to get a cheque to the bank by 2pm that day or the deal was cancelled. In order to meet the deadline, an official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. Republican and Democratic politicians, who agree on little else, believe the pandemic has exposed America's over-reliance on foreign manufacturers for essential medical supplies. The US now imports half of its personal protective equipment from China and the figure for many vital pharmaceuticals is even higher. 'Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures.' Chinese pharmaceutical companies supply an estimated 90 per cent of US antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone. ""Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures,"" Navarro said last week. He has been pushing Trump to force government agencies to procure all of their medical supplies from US manufacturers. Last month Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill that, if passed, will direct the Department of Defence to determine whether America's reliance on China for pharmaceuticals is a national security concern.

11,/world/north-america/a-civic-catastrophe-wisconsin-elections-go-ahead-despite-pandemic-20200408-p54i33.html,'A civic catastrophe': Wisconsin elections go ahead despite pandemic,"Washington: Six million people in Wisconsin, in the US Midwest, are currently living under an order requiring them to stay at home except for essential reasons - like visiting the pharmacy or grocery store. But despite these tough social distancing rules, Wisconsinites went to the polls on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) to vote in the Democratic presidential primary and a series of local elections. Voters wait in line to vote at Riverside High School in Milwaukee for Wisconsin's primary election. Credit:AP Unlike 15 other states which have opted to postpone their planned primaries, Wisconsin ploughed ahead with the scheduled date. Tony Evers, the state's Democratic Governor, wanted to delay in-person voting until June, but was blocked by the Republican-controlled state legislature and the Supreme Court. The legislature also rejected Evers' plan to make it easier for all the state's residents to vote by mail. The sight of Wisconsinites waiting in long lines to cast ballots and poll workers wearing HAZMAT suits stunned many Americans. Should citizens in a democracy, they asked, really have to choose between their safety and their right to vote? One widely-circulated image showed a voter, wearing a mask while waiting in line, with a cardboard sign saying: ""This is ridiculous"". Politico called Tuesday's election ""a civic catastrophe that never should have happened"". The New York Times described the decision to proceed with voting as ""insane, and utterly unnecessary"". Because of concerns about the coronavirus, there was a huge drop in the number of poll workers willing to show up to administer the elections. This led to a massive reduction in the number of polling places and, in turn, longer than usual lines. In Milwaukee, the state's biggest city, the number of polling places dropped from 180 to just five. Susan Rice, Barack Obama's former national security adviser, responded to a Twitter image of long lines in Milwaukee with a one-word reply: ""Evil"". To those familiar with the bitter partisanship that has dominated Wisconsin's recent politics, the state's idiosyncratic decision to carry out the election was not so surprising. A poll worker sprays down a voting booth after use inside the polling location at Riverside High School  in Milwaukee.Credit:Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel Wisconsin is almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which heightens the intensity of electoral contests. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by just 0.77 per cent of the vote in Wisconsin in 2016. The state's officials have aggressively ""purged"" voters from electoral rolls and introduced tough voter identification laws that require residents to show a driver's licence or other photo ID in order to cast a ballot. Wisconsin is also a hot spot for ""gerrymandering"", the phenomenon where politicians draw electoral boundaries to help ensure their re-election. In the 2018 state legislature elections, Democrats won 53 per cent of the votes but received just 34 per cent of seats. Sisters Kelly and Teal Rowe work behind a plexiglass barrier while waiting to verify voters at the town's highway garage facility in Dunn, Wisconsin.Credit:AP If Tuesday's vote had simply been a Democratic primary, Republican politicians may not have been so insistent on going ahead with the election. But they were concerned about another election held on the same day: a contest for a seat on the state's Supreme Court. The race pitted a conservative judge, Daniel Kelly, against a progressive challenger Jill Karofsky. Republicans hope that low voter turnout in urban areas will help keep the seat in conservative hands. While the battle over voting rights in Wisconsin is especially intense, it reflects a bigger battle playing out between Democrats and Republicans ahead of November's presidential election. If the virus is still circulating or has re-appeared by then, the same issues will emerge again. Democrats are pushing for federal legislation that would allow all Americans to vote by mail in November. Republicans reject that idea, saying it is up to states to make electoral laws and that mail-in ballots are prone to fraud. Asked recently if he supported voting by mail, Trump said: ""No, because I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting... It should not be mailed in. You should vote at the booth, and you should have voter ID."" Matthew Knott is North America correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Copyright © 2020", Matthew Knott ,"April 8, 2020"
12,/world/north-america/trump-s-off-the-rails-briefings-test-america-s-patience-20200407-p54hst.html,Trump's 'off the rails' coronavirus briefings test America's patience,"Washington: Just before 7.30pm on Monday (Tuesday AEST) Deborah Birx walked to the lectern at the White House briefing room. The physician, who is co-ordinating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus, was there to present the latest national data on the pandemic and advise Americans about how to keep themselves safe. Replay   But most Americans - even if they were tuned in to cable news at the time - never saw Birx speak. The daily briefing had already been going for two hours, dominated by a fiery question-and-answer session between US President Donald Trump and reporters. By the time Birx was called upon to give her update, two of the three main cable news channels, CNN and MSNBC, had already switched back to regular programming. Only Fox News was still airing the press conference. The White House's bloated briefings - which commonly last longer than your average feature film, if not yet Martin Scorsese's The Irishman - are increasingly testing the patience of news broadcasters. Even some of Trump's most loyal Republican allies want them to be dramatically cut back. President Donald Trump reacts as Dr Deborah Birx  speaks about her granddaughter's fever.Credit:AP Trump can be accused of many things, but not of hiding from the media. He usually takes multiple rounds of questions from the reporters in the room - even those he disparages as ""fake news"". As the televisual equivalent of a mood ring, the briefings are extremely useful. Each day you see Trump's feelings about the pandemic shift - from dismissive to serious to frustrated and back again.  But as a vehicle for delivering facts and information about the outbreak, the briefings are becoming increasingly ineffective. Health experts like Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci now resemble film extras, standing silently for hours at a time as Trump commands the podium. Presumably, they have other important things to do. The first hour of a briefing last week wasn't even about the coronavirus, but the Trump administration's efforts to halt the illegal drug trade. And for all Trump's showmanship, they don't necessarily create news - even as they run for hours. The main purpose of the briefings, it appears, is to keep Trump on prime-time TV for as long as possible and to deny media oxygen to anyone else, including his likely presidential rival Joe Biden. Around midday on Sunday, the White House press office called a ""lid"" - meaning Trump did not have any public events on his schedule for the rest of the day. Five hours later, reporters were told to assemble at the White House. Trump and the members of the coronavirus taskforce would give a daily briefing after all. At 7pm, when TV ratings are at their highest, Trump appeared and spoke for two hours - even though he didn't have anything new to say. His briefing coincided precisely with a livestreamed Biden coronavirus event that had been announced the day before. The main news takeaway was that Trump again hyped up hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, as a potential treatment for the virus. When reporters tried to ask Fauci for his opinion on the drug, Trump refused to let him answer. This week Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a staunch Trump loyalist, said the President should let health experts like Birx and Fauci take the lead at the briefings. ""And so sometimes I think it goes off the rails a little bit,"" she said. ""But you know, that’s the way the President conducts business.""

15,/world/north-america/this-is-how-america-s-coronavirus-response-went-wrong-20200409-p54ii6.html,This is how America's coronavirus response went wrong,"Washington: The view that the United States is an exceptional nation has long been central to the country's self-image. Ronald Reagan famously described America as ""a shining city upon a hill"". Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's secretary of state, called it ""the indispensable nation"". Replay   ""To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation,"" former Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee said in 2009. But the belief in American exceptionalism has taken a battering in recent years. The Iraq War, the global financial crisis, regular mass shootings, entrenched poverty and the rise of China have shaken the country's sense of superiority. When it came to combating COVID-19, however, there were still good reasons to believe America would stand above the rest of the world. The country is home to many of the world's leading medical experts, pharmaceutical companies and public health institutions. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index - a detailed study published by Johns Hopkins University and the Nuclear Threat Initiative - judged the US better placed than any other nation to respond to a pandemic or epidemic. But that's not how things have turned out. The Trump administration moved quickly to restrict arrivals from China, but did little to prevent the spread of the virus domestically. Donald Trump spent weeks downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus as it was spreading through the US.Credit:Bloomberg The virus is now killing almost 2000 Americans each day - more than anywhere else in the world. Almost 16,000 people have died in the US after contracting the virus, putting it second only to Italy. Rather than affirming American exceptionalism, the pandemic has fed into a narrative of American decline. ""Long before COVID-19 ravaged the earth, there had already been a precipitous decline in the appeal of the American model,"" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. ""The federal government’s slow, incoherent, and all too often ineffective response to the pandemic will reinforce the already widespread view that the United States has lost its way."" On January 30, Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's top trade adviser, wrote a memo warning that the coronavirus could create a pandemic. In late February, he wrote a second memo saying the virus could kill up to 2 million Americans. On the day Navarro sent his first memo, Trump was assuring Americans that everything would be fine. ""We think we have it very well under control,"" the President said. A few days later Trump said the number of cases in the US would soon be ""down to zero"". As late as March 6, he was favourably comparing the coronavirus to the regular flu. Trump's relaxed rhetoric set the tone for Republican politicians and prominent media figures. It was not until March 17 that the President publicly grasped the seriousness of the virus, describing it as a highly contagious ""invisible enemy"" and announcing tough social distancing guidelines. At the state and local level, some leaders have been more proactive than others. San Francisco implemented a stay-at-home order on March 16. Despite being the country's second most densely-populated city, it has only recorded 10 deaths from the virus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo didn't issue a similar order until a week later. The virus was already running rampant in his state, but that was only beginning to become clear. The signature failure of the US response to the coronavirus was the slow rollout of mass testing. Because of technical glitches and bureaucratic bungling, the US was flying blind as the virus spread through the country in February and early March. Instead of using a test developed by the World Health Organisation, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opted to develop its own test. This wasn't particularly unusual. It’s common for nations with strong scientific expertise to develop their own diagnostics. The CDC was indeed able to quickly develop a viable coronavirus test, but struggled to ramp up production. When it started sending out test kits to public health laboratories in early February, problems emerged immediately. Trial runs produced inconclusive results in more than half the labs, meaning the tests couldn’t be relied upon. The CDC implemented a workaround solution, which required the labs to send tests back to the organisation's headquarters in Atlanta. This resulted in days-long delays. By mid-February, the nation was testing only about 100 samples per day. Top researchers at prestigious universities were also hindered in their efforts to roll out their own COVID-19 tests. On January 31 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. It was an important declaration but had unintended consequences. Hospitals and private laboratories that usually face minimal federal regulation were now subject to new rules that required them to obtain permission from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) before using their own tests. It wasn't until late February that the FDA relaxed its rules and allowed certain laboratories to develop and use their own tests before authorisation. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right, helped make the case for a longer shutdown to US President Donald Trump.Credit:Bloomberg The testing failures in the US can be vividly seen by comparing it to South Korea. Both countries recorded their first case of COVID-19 on January 20. By the middle of March, South Korea had conducted 290,000 coronavirus tests. At that time the US had only performed an estimated 60,000. The difference is even more damning when you take into account that the US population is seven times larger than South Korea's. Asked about the testing shortage at a congressional hearing in March, Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said: ""It is a failing, let's admit it."" The pace of testing has increased dramatically over recent weeks. Around 100,000 people are now being tested each day. But the surge came too late to identify emerging hotspots such as New York. For frontline health workers in the US, the biggest concern during the pandemic has been the dire lack of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Hospital staff have held protests outside hospitals pleading for more protective gear. In New York, Broadway costume designers have been sewing masks to donate to hospital workers. Some nurses have been wearing bin bags over their scrubs, while doctors have resorted to wearing ski goggles. Skiers and snowboarders are asked to donate goggles for medical use outside a ski shop in Vermont. Credit:GogglesForDocs Countries around the world have struggled to secure medical supplies, but in the US the problem has been exacerbated by government failures. Trump was slow to invoke the Defence Production Act, a law that allows him to order private companies to manufacture supplies necessary for a national emergency. An official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the ventilator supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. And the lack of planning and co-ordination from the federal government has forced states to compete for vital supplies. This has driven up prices and led to what has been dubbed a ""Wild West"" environment for procurement. The Chicago Sun-Times reported on the remarkable example of officials in Illinois who tracked down a supply of 1.5 million N95 respirator masks in China through a middleman. One day before they expected to complete the purchase, the officials got a call from the supplier saying he had to get a cheque to the bank by 2pm that day or the deal was cancelled. In order to meet the deadline, an official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. Republican and Democratic politicians, who agree on little else, believe the pandemic has exposed America's over-reliance on foreign manufacturers for essential medical supplies.

He has been pushing Trump to force government agencies to procure all of their medical supplies from US manufacturers. Last month Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill that, if passed, will direct the Department of Defence to determine whether America's reliance on China for pharmaceuticals is a national security concern.

16,/world/north-america/this-is-how-america-s-coronavirus-response-went-wrong-20200409-p54ii6.html,This is how America's coronavirus response went wrong,"Washington: The view that the United States is an exceptional nation has long been central to the country's self-image. Ronald Reagan famously described America as ""a shining city upon a hill"". Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's secretary of state, called it ""the indispensable nation"". Replay   ""To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation,"" former Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee said in 2009. But the belief in American exceptionalism has taken a battering in recent years. The Iraq War, the global financial crisis, regular mass shootings, entrenched poverty and the rise of China have shaken the country's sense of superiority. When it came to combating COVID-19, however, there were still good reasons to believe America would stand above the rest of the world. The country is home to many of the world's leading medical experts, pharmaceutical companies and public health institutions. In 2019, the Global Health Security Index - a detailed study published by Johns Hopkins University and the Nuclear Threat Initiative - judged the US better placed than any other nation to respond to a pandemic or epidemic. But that's not how things have turned out. The Trump administration moved quickly to restrict arrivals from China, but did little to prevent the spread of the virus domestically. Donald Trump spent weeks downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus as it was spreading through the US.Credit:Bloomberg The virus is now killing almost 2000 Americans each day - more than anywhere else in the world. Almost 16,000 people have died in the US after contracting the virus, putting it second only to Italy. Rather than affirming American exceptionalism, the pandemic has fed into a narrative of American decline. ""Long before COVID-19 ravaged the earth, there had already been a precipitous decline in the appeal of the American model,"" Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in Foreign Affairs this week. ""The federal government’s slow, incoherent, and all too often ineffective response to the pandemic will reinforce the already widespread view that the United States has lost its way."" On January 30, Peter Navarro, Donald Trump's top trade adviser, wrote a memo warning that the coronavirus could create a pandemic. In late February, he wrote a second memo saying the virus could kill up to 2 million Americans. On the day Navarro sent his first memo, Trump was assuring Americans that everything would be fine. ""We think we have it very well under control,"" the President said. A few days later Trump said the number of cases in the US would soon be ""down to zero"". As late as March 6, he was favourably comparing the coronavirus to the regular flu. Trump's relaxed rhetoric set the tone for Republican politicians and prominent media figures. It was not until March 17 that the President publicly grasped the seriousness of the virus, describing it as a highly contagious ""invisible enemy"" and announcing tough social distancing guidelines. At the state and local level, some leaders have been more proactive than others. San Francisco implemented a stay-at-home order on March 16. Despite being the country's second most densely-populated city, it has only recorded 10 deaths from the virus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo didn't issue a similar order until a week later. The virus was already running rampant in his state, but that was only beginning to become clear. The signature failure of the US response to the coronavirus was the slow rollout of mass testing. Because of technical glitches and bureaucratic bungling, the US was flying blind as the virus spread through the country in February and early March. Instead of using a test developed by the World Health Organisation, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) opted to develop its own test. This wasn't particularly unusual. It’s common for nations with strong scientific expertise to develop their own diagnostics. The CDC was indeed able to quickly develop a viable coronavirus test, but struggled to ramp up production. When it started sending out test kits to public health laboratories in early February, problems emerged immediately. Trial runs produced inconclusive results in more than half the labs, meaning the tests couldn’t be relied upon. The CDC implemented a workaround solution, which required the labs to send tests back to the organisation's headquarters in Atlanta. This resulted in days-long delays. By mid-February, the nation was testing only about 100 samples per day. Top researchers at prestigious universities were also hindered in their efforts to roll out their own COVID-19 tests. On January 31 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. It was an important declaration but had unintended consequences. Hospitals and private laboratories that usually face minimal federal regulation were now subject to new rules that required them to obtain permission from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) before using their own tests. It wasn't until late February that the FDA relaxed its rules and allowed certain laboratories to develop and use their own tests before authorisation. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right, helped make the case for a longer shutdown to US President Donald Trump.Credit:Bloomberg The testing failures in the US can be vividly seen by comparing it to South Korea. Both countries recorded their first case of COVID-19 on January 20. By the middle of March, South Korea had conducted 290,000 coronavirus tests. At that time the US had only performed an estimated 60,000. The difference is even more damning when you take into account that the US population is seven times larger than South Korea's. Asked about the testing shortage at a congressional hearing in March, Dr Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said: ""It is a failing, let's admit it."" The pace of testing has increased dramatically over recent weeks. Around 100,000 people are now being tested each day. But the surge came too late to identify emerging hotspots such as New York. For frontline health workers in the US, the biggest concern during the pandemic has been the dire lack of personal protective equipment and ventilators. Hospital staff have held protests outside hospitals pleading for more protective gear. In New York, Broadway costume designers have been sewing masks to donate to hospital workers. Some nurses have been wearing bin bags over their scrubs, while doctors have resorted to wearing ski goggles. Skiers and snowboarders are asked to donate goggles for medical use outside a ski shop in Vermont. Credit:GogglesForDocs Countries around the world have struggled to secure medical supplies, but in the US the problem has been exacerbated by government failures. Trump was slow to invoke the Defence Production Act, a law that allows him to order private companies to manufacture supplies necessary for a national emergency. An official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the ventilator supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. And the lack of planning and co-ordination from the federal government has forced states to compete for vital supplies. This has driven up prices and led to what has been dubbed a ""Wild West"" environment for procurement. The Chicago Sun-Times reported on the remarkable example of officials in Illinois who tracked down a supply of 1.5 million N95 respirator masks in China through a middleman. One day before they expected to complete the purchase, the officials got a call from the supplier saying he had to get a cheque to the bank by 2pm that day or the deal was cancelled. In order to meet the deadline, an official jumped into her car and hit the highway carrying a cheque for $US3.5 million ($5.6 million). She and the supplier met in a McDonald’s carpark and he was able to bank the cheque with 20 minutes to spare. Republican and Democratic politicians, who agree on little else, believe the pandemic has exposed America's over-reliance on foreign manufacturers for essential medical supplies. The US now imports half of its personal protective equipment from China and the figure for many vital pharmaceuticals is even higher. 'Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures.' Chinese pharmaceutical companies supply an estimated 90 per cent of US antibiotics, vitamin C, ibuprofen and hydrocortisone. ""Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and countermeasures,"" Navarro said last week. He has been pushing Trump to force government agencies to procure all of their medical supplies from US manufacturers. Last month Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democrat Elizabeth Warren introduced a bill that, if passed, will direct the Department of Defence to determine whether America's reliance on China for pharmaceuticals is a national security concern. A patient is transferred to a waiting ambulance in New York. Credit:AP Last week the White House projected that between 100,000 to 240,000 people could die from the virus in the US - a figure that stunned Americans. They received some welcome news this week when the main model used by the White House showed a big reduction in projected deaths. The model now forecasts that 60,415 people will die by August. ""We know now for sure that the mitigation that we have been doing is having a positive effect,"" Fauci said. Replay   That news sat alongside grim updates from New York, which recorded its biggest single-day death toll of 799 on Thursday (Friday AEST). The state has now lost more than 7000 people to the virus, compared to 2723 in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.

Storm clouds gather above the White House in Washington.Credit:Bloomberg Oxford Economics, for one, now sees Trump on track to secure about 43 per cent of the popular vote. That's a collapse from the firm's October call that he stood to win 55 per cent of the vote. Still, it's an open question whether the economy will ultimately doom Trump in November.

US President Donald Trump speaks during a Coronavirus Task Force news conference.Credit:Bloomberg Oxford's revised prediction flows from the firm's latest GDP forecast, released Wednesday: It sees gross domestic product declining by roughly 4 per cent this year. And Gregory Daco, chief US economist for the firm, says he expects unemployment will ""linger in the vicinity of 10 per cent"" into the northern autumn. The firm's election forecasting model leans heavily on three variables - unemployment, inflation and real disposable income growth. Of those only inflation, tamed by collapsing oil prices, has been trending in Trump's favour, and ""it's not enough to offset the hit from unemployment and income,"" Daco says. The firm has yet to update its electoral college projection, which in January showed Trump losing even amid a relatively strong economy if Democrats simply replicated their turnout in the 2004, 2008 or 2016 elections. A closer look at key swing states reveals the damage the economic downturn may be wreaking on Trump's chances. In six states that delivered Trump's 2016 victory - Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - jobless claims collectively skyrocketed past a staggering 2 million in the last two weeks of March. That amounts to ""more than 5 times Trump's raw vote margin of victory"" in those states, Cowen Washington Research Group observes in a note. ""One of the ironclad rules of politics (pre 2016) was that recessions kill Presidential reelections,"" Cowen's Chris Krueger writes.

Not every forecaster sees Trump's prospects taking a dire turn.

Donald Luskin, the firm's chief investment officer, notes the model has only incorporated two variables that updated recently, oil prices and payrolls, and those ""have basically been a push."" But that will likely change if a recession persists deeper into the calendar this year. ""It's just a race to see how quickly we can end this man-made recession and put people back to work,"" Luskin says. Until that picture becomes clearer, he says forecasters should operate with a healthy dose of humility.

Betting markets, for their part, continue to give Trump a solid edge over Biden. That margin didn't narrow Wednesday after Senator Bernie Sanders, suspended his presidential bid, sealing Biden's position as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

23,/world/europe/johnson-s-hospitalisation-exposes-potential-flaw-in-the-british-system-20200410-p54iug.html,Johnson's hospitalisation exposes potential flaw in the British system,"On a cold and drizzly London morning in February 2018, Boris Johnson and his friend Julie Bishop went for a jog wearing matching T-shirts. When Bishop met her British counterpart outside his ministerial grace-and-favour pad in central London, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace, he had a surprise for the Australian foreign affairs minister. It was a shirt emblazoned with one message: “Save the pangolin”. Ending the illegal wildlife trade, including that of the pangolin, was then one of Johnson’s pet projects. Julie Bishop and Boris Johnson enjoy a brisk jog around London. Credit:Twitter/Julie Bishop As Johnson shuffled along, a bit like his new favourite animal, the fitter Bishop could be heard telling the British foreign secretary “We’ve got lots of discussions post-Brexit”, including a free-trade agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. “When I visited him later that day he had a big stuffed furry animal, a pangolin, on his desk,” Bishop tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “So he was very keen that we save this animal that was facing extinction, or so he believed. That was one of his causes there for a while, I’m not sure he is still in that frame of mind.” Bishop says it never crossed her mind that one of the reasons to stop the live animal trade was to prevent a worldwide crisis like COVID-19. While the virus likely originated in bats, it is probable that it passed to humans through another mammal at a wet market in Wuhan, China. The gentle, toothless pangolin - the most trafficked animal on the planet - is shaping up as the unwitting culprit. A little over two years later, Johnson is in a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, struck down by a virus that may have spread to humans by the very mammal he was trying to save. The prime minister’s hospitalisation this week has hit Britain’s resolve when it needed inspiration from its larger-than-life leader. It has also exposed a potential flaw in the British system; with its lack of written constitution and codified order of succession for the prime ministership, there is now a leadership vacuum at a time when some of the most important decisions in the nation’s history need to be made. It has left the world without the one leader who could credibly serve as a bridge between US President Donald Trump and Europe. And as the world enters an uncertain and pivotal few months, it has also highlighted the need to spare global leaders from this lethal virus as they try to stop its spread. Replay   As Johnson was rushed to St Thomas' Hospital in central London this week, his foreign secretary Dominic Raab was asked to deputise for him “where necessary”. Raab declined to answer questions about the extent of his powers, which has only served to create more uncertainty in a week when the nation’s death tally soared to more than 7000. The fact that the reins have been handed over to Raab, a relative unknown until a few years ago, is an indictment on the bitter politics of Brexit, of which Johnson cannot escape significant responsibility. Brexit has left a hollowed-out Conservative Party in its wake. If David Cameron went down, the country would have turned to ministerial heavyweights like George Osborne, Theresa May or William Hague to fill the void. Britain now only has one credible leader, and he is still recovering in a hospital bed. Around the world, governments are taking the threat of their leaders falling victim to COVID-19 seriously. In Australia, there are limits on the amount of people allowed into Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s office and everyone entering must use hand sanitiser. All leadership meetings and all meetings not involving staff employed within the office are conducted on screens rather than in person. Morrison is also receiving regular medical check-ups. Succumbing to illness at a time of global crisis is not new, but it is the first time it has occurred in generations. Aides to British PM David Lloyd George feared he wouldn't make it to the end of World War I after he fell ill speaking in Manchester, a centre of the Spanish flu epidemic. World War II took such a toll on Australia's John Curtin and US president Franklin D. Roosevelt they didn't survive to see the end of it. Britain's Winston Churchill suffered a heart attack during the height of the war in 1941 and contracted pneumonia two years later, before having a serious stroke in his second spell as prime minister a decade later. Herve Lemahieu, director of the power and diplomacy program at the Lowy Institute, says Britain’s system of politics had not been designed for a contingency such as this. The order of succession for American presidents is set out in the US constitution, while Australia’s major parties have always had deputy prime ministers who can be called upon by the Governor-General in the event of the leader falling ill. Raab, as “first secretary of state”, would become the British government’s de facto leader if the prime minister could not carry out his duties, but he has only been “deputised” by Johnson.

I don't think anyone, least of all Raab and particularly Boris Johnson, ever assumed he would be filling in as prime minister."" Bishop says she was “shocked” to see Johnson was transferred to intensive care this week, and it was “deeply concerning” to have the leader of one of the world’s largest economies “and most significant nations” struck down during the crisis. “What I think we see at present is that not only the British people, but the world at large, want Boris to get healthy as soon as possible,” she says. “It is vital that nations feel confident that their leaders are healthy and are in charge of coordinating the response effectively to the global pandemic, and a loss of confidence in government would have important implications as people would be more likely to be concerned about the responses that they are being required to undertake that could worsen the crisis.” According to colleagues who have worked with Johnson, the 55-year-old prime minister has always hated the thought of illness. Perhaps it is this disregard that led him to last month boast about shaking hands with coronavirus victims in hospital. It is the same contempt for mortality that he admires in his hero Churchill. In his 2015 book, The Churchill Factor, Johnson wrote that Britain’s prime minister carried on “through sheer force of will” after his 1953 stroke, insisting on trying to organise a summit between the Americans and Russians. “The story of Churchill’s last years in office is not of some giant red sun, heat gone, sinking slowly out of sight,” Johnson wrote. “He is no volcano puttering himself to extinction. He is Tennyson’s Ulysses - always struggling, striving, seeking: always convinced that some deed of note may yet be done. It is a story of unbelievable courage and willpower - and cunning.” Boris Johnson pictured chairing a recent COVID-19 meeting remotely.Credit:AP Bishop says Johnson would find it “very frustrating” to be incapacitated. “He is so full of energy, he is always in a hurry, Boris is always rushing to the next issue, to the next event. His enthusiasm is infectious and I certainly always enjoyed his company,” she says. “He was endlessly entertaining and intellectually challenging, but he is also great company, and he seems to thrive on having ideas and challenges in front of him that he can tackle."" Bishop first met Johnson in 2012 when he was mayor of London, but the two struck up a rapport when they were both in the foreign portfolios.  A year before their early-morning jog, they met prior to a press conference in London. Bishop was confronted with Johnson's blond hair in its signature dishevelled state and his French designer necktie askew. “The short part of the tie was at the front of the tie and the big Hermes label was sitting out there and I said: ‘Boris, this will never do, we cannot do a press conference on Brexit with you so obviously displaying a French designer tie’,” Bishop recalls. “He gives the impression that he cares not a jot for his appearance.” Bishop says Johnson’s “clever wit and sense of humour” belies a deep and serious thinker. She has always warned colleagues not to underestimate Johnson, saying he has a “formidable intellect” and a “very interesting and compelling leadership style”. The temporary loss of Johnson also means Australia is without one of its biggest fans. The British PM spent his gap year before university as a tutor at Geelong Grammar in 1983. As foreign secretary, he heeded Australia’s calls for Britain to re-engage in the Pacific, creating three new diplomatic posts in the region. Bishop says Johnson is a “great friend of Australia” and has always been a “rock of support” whenever the country has needed it. On Thursday night, Johnson was moved out of intensive care and was said to be in “extremely good spirits”. It is believed he may need as long as a month to return to work and, even then, may have to return to full duties gradually. Johnson’s illness has reminded the country that this virus doesn’t discriminate and is as potentially crippling for a factory worker in Birmingham as an old Etonian in Downing Street. While the news has shocked Britain, it has also united a bitterly divided nation behind its leader. Through his suffering he has endeared himself to the public in a way no thumping election victory can. It will now fall to him to pick up the country on his shoulders, and once again shuffle forwards.

24,/world/europe/johnson-s-hospitalisation-exposes-potential-flaw-in-the-british-system-20200410-p54iug.html,Johnson's hospitalisation exposes potential flaw in the British system,"On a cold and drizzly London morning in February 2018, Boris Johnson and his friend Julie Bishop went for a jog wearing matching T-shirts. When Bishop met her British counterpart outside his ministerial grace-and-favour pad in central London, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace, he had a surprise for the Australian foreign affairs minister. It was a shirt emblazoned with one message: “Save the pangolin”. Ending the illegal wildlife trade, including that of the pangolin, was then one of Johnson’s pet projects. Julie Bishop and Boris Johnson enjoy a brisk jog around London. Credit:Twitter/Julie Bishop As Johnson shuffled along, a bit like his new favourite animal, the fitter Bishop could be heard telling the British foreign secretary “We’ve got lots of discussions post-Brexit”, including a free-trade agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. “When I visited him later that day he had a big stuffed furry animal, a pangolin, on his desk,” Bishop tells The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “So he was very keen that we save this animal that was facing extinction, or so he believed. That was one of his causes there for a while, I’m not sure he is still in that frame of mind.” Bishop says it never crossed her mind that one of the reasons to stop the live animal trade was to prevent a worldwide crisis like COVID-19. While the virus likely originated in bats, it is probable that it passed to humans through another mammal at a wet market in Wuhan, China. The gentle, toothless pangolin - the most trafficked animal on the planet - is shaping up as the unwitting culprit. A little over two years later, Johnson is in a hospital ward after spending three nights in intensive care, struck down by a virus that may have spread to humans by the very mammal he was trying to save. The prime minister’s hospitalisation this week has hit Britain’s resolve when it needed inspiration from its larger-than-life leader. It has also exposed a potential flaw in the British system; with its lack of written constitution and codified order of succession for the prime ministership, there is now a leadership vacuum at a time when some of the most important decisions in the nation’s history need to be made. It has left the world without the one leader who could credibly serve as a bridge between US President Donald Trump and Europe. And as the world enters an uncertain and pivotal few months, it has also highlighted the need to spare global leaders from this lethal virus as they try to stop its spread. Replay   As Johnson was rushed to St Thomas' Hospital in central London this week, his foreign secretary Dominic Raab was asked to deputise for him “where necessary”. Raab declined to answer questions about the extent of his powers, which has only served to create more uncertainty in a week when the nation’s death tally soared to more than 7000. The fact that the reins have been handed over to Raab, a relative unknown until a few years ago, is an indictment on the bitter politics of Brexit, of which Johnson cannot escape significant responsibility. Brexit has left a hollowed-out Conservative Party in its wake. If David Cameron went down, the country would have turned to ministerial heavyweights like George Osborne, Theresa May or William Hague to fill the void. Britain now only has one credible leader, and he is still recovering in a hospital bed. Around the world, governments are taking the threat of their leaders falling victim to COVID-19 seriously.

25,/world/europe/organised-effort-helping-drive-5g-virus-conspiracy-theory-online-20200410-p54isx.html,Organised effort helping drive 5G coronavirus conspiracy theory,"London: A conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the outbreak of the coronavirus is quickly gaining momentum, with celebrities including actor Woody Harrelson promoting the idea. But the theory is also getting a boost from what some researchers say is a coordinated disinformation campaign. Attendees are silhouetted beside a 5G display on the Deutsche Telekom exhibit in Berlin.Credit:Bloomberg Marc Owen Jones, a researcher at Hamad bin Khalifa University in Qatar, who specialises in online disinformation networks, analysed 22,000 recent interactions on Twitter mentioning ""5G"" and ""corona"" and said he found a large number of accounts displaying what he termed ""inauthentic activity."" He said the effort bore some hallmarks of a state-backed campaign. ""There are very strong indications that some of these accounts are a disinformation operation,"" Jones said. Jones said the campaign used a strategy similar to that employed by Russia's Internet Research Agency, which was behind a disinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential campaign. But he said he hasn't yet concluded that Russia, or any other government or organisation, is behind the effort. Blackbird.AI, a New York-based company that monitors online disinformation campaigns, said it had in recent weeks identified a surge in the number of social media posts promoting the 5G conspiracy theory. In the previous 24 hours, there had been more than 50,000 posts about the topic on Twitter and Reddit, Naushad UzZaman, the company's chief technology officer and co-founder, said on Wednesday. There has been a ""significant uptick in inauthentic amplification"" of posts on social media linking 5G to the coronavirus, UzZaman said, indicating that there could be a coordinated campaign and bot accounts involved. A fire-damaged telecom tower, reported in local media as being a 5G network mast, stands in Birmingham, England.Credit:Bloomberg The company says it uses a system that analyses language, communication patterns, post volumes and bot activity in order to identify social media posts that are ""inauthentic"" and attempting to manipulate online discussion. Blackbird.AI hasn't determined who is behind the effort, nor have the researchers at the Global Disinformation Index, a non-profit that tracks disinformation online. ""We've definitely seen plenty of organised disinfo around 5G-coronavirus,"" said Danny Rogers, the index's co-founder. False stories on social media can be disseminated broadly by both government and non-government groups -- with bot accounts available for purchase or rental online, said Lee Foster, a senior manager at the cyber security firm FireEye. ""The barriers to entry are really low, so any number of actors can replicate the same kind of techniques."" Ali Tehrani, founder and chief executive officer of Astroscreen, a London-based company that monitors social media manipulation, said there was a concerted effort by suspicious accounts to amplify the 5G conspiracy theory on social media, which was mixed with a much larger number of genuine accounts circulating the claims. ""We've seen accounts that you could say are inauthentic and coordinated promoting the 5G conspiracy, but I think the bigger problem right now is high-profile individuals spreading misleading information,"" he said. Twitter declined to comment.  Conspiracy theories about health risks associated with 5G have circulated since at least 2016. They were first spread on internet forums and YouTube, and were later picked up by the website InfoWars and Russian state broadcaster RT, which published stories cautioning that 5G could be ""a global catastrophe,"" causing cancer in humans and wildlife. Earlier this year, as COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, began to spread from China to the rest of the world, fringe groups began claiming that the virus was linked to 5G technology. The claims may have originated with comments made by a doctor in Belgium, saying he believed 5G was ""life-threatening"" and connected to the coronavirus, while noting that he had ""not done a fact-check,"" according to an article in Wired magazine. The newspaper that printed his comments retracted the story, but that didn't stop the conspiracy theory from gaining traction. Some celebrities - including the singer M.I.A. and the actor John Cusack -- have fanned the flames, posting suggestions on social media that 5G is linked to the spread of the virus or otherwise poses health risks. Meanwhile, users of online forums such as 4chan have encouraged people to vandalise 5G equipment. In recent days, at least 20 mobile phone masts have been attacked in the UK, some set on fire, and British telecommunications companies have issued statements saying the 5G conspiracy theory has led to abuse of their employees. Some users of 4chan celebrated the news that 5G mobile phone masts had been targeted by arsonists and encouraged copycat actions. Bloomberg Copyright © 2020", Ryan Gallagher ,"April 10, 2020"

29,/world/europe/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-moved-out-of-intensive-care-20200410-p54irz.html,British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved out of intensive care,"London: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Thursday evening moved out of the intensive care unit of a London hospital where he is being treated for coronavirus. Replay   In a statement, a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said Johnson ""has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery."" Johnson had been in intensive care for three days after his symptoms for coronavirus worsened. He tested positive for the virus two weeks ago and at first had only ""mild"" symptoms. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, told a press conference that Johnson was ""making positive steps forward"" and was in good spirits. Raab used the same briefing to tell Britons it was too early to ease restrictions on public activity imposed March 23 to try to slow the spread of the virus. The original restrictions were for three weeks – a period that ends Monday. But after chairing a meeting of the government's crisis committee, COBRA, Raab said no decision on lifting the government's stay-home order and business closures would be made ""until evidence clearly shows that we've moved beyond the peak"" of the outbreak. Raab said ""we're starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we've all made, but the deaths are still rising and we haven't yet reached the peak of the virus."" He said the government and its scientific experts would assess the evidence again next week. ""We mustn't give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and to hurt our country,"" Raab said. Almost 8000 people with the coronavirus have died in British hospitals, according to government figures. While the number of new confirmed cases has begun to plateau, deaths have neared the peaks seen in Italy and Spain, the two countries with the greatest number of fatalities. On Thursday, the UK reported 881 new deaths, down from the 938 recorded the day before. Italy recorded a high of 969 deaths on March 27 and Spain 950 deaths on April 2. The number of people in intensive care units for coronavirus infection in France fell slightly for the first time since the start of the epidemic, but the number of people dying in nursing homes jumped by more than 50 per cent over two days, health ministry data showed on Thursday. Health Ministry Director Jerome Salomon said that the number of people in ICU fell by 82 or 1.1 per cent to 7066, five days after Italy also had seen that number falling. The figures may not be directly comparable, however. Not all the UK deaths reported each day occurred in the preceding 24 hours, and the total only includes deaths in hospitals – it does not include aged care homes. British officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Currently most parks remain open and people are allowed to go outside for essential work, shopping and exercise. While most Britons have observed the rules, there have been breaches. Police in the northern city of Manchester said they had broken up 660 parties over the past two weeks, including some with DJs and fireworks. Nick Adderley, the chief of Northamptonshire Police in central England, said on Thursday that his officers might have to set up road blocks and start ""checking the items in [shopping] baskets and trolleys to see whether it's a legitimate, necessary item."" Civil liberties group Big Brother Watch called those comments ""outrageous"" and Adderley later clarified that his officers would not be inspecting people's shopping. Johnson's government was slower than those in some European countries to impose restrictions on daily life in response to the pandemic, leading his critics to accuse him of complacency. Britain also had one of the lowest numbers of hospital beds per capita in western Europe before the pandemic, with only about 5000 intensive care beds nationwide. That number has been increased vastly in the past few weeks, both by converting other areas of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and by building temporary facilities, including a 4000-bed hospital at London's Excel conference centre. So far, hospitals have been stretched but not overwhelmed.

30,/world/europe/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-moved-out-of-intensive-care-20200410-p54irz.html,British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved out of intensive care,"London: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Thursday evening moved out of the intensive care unit of a London hospital where he is being treated for coronavirus. Replay   In a statement, a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said Johnson ""has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery."" Johnson had been in intensive care for three days after his symptoms for coronavirus worsened. He tested positive for the virus two weeks ago and at first had only ""mild"" symptoms. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson, told a press conference that Johnson was ""making positive steps forward"" and was in good spirits. Raab used the same briefing to tell Britons it was too early to ease restrictions on public activity imposed March 23 to try to slow the spread of the virus. The original restrictions were for three weeks – a period that ends Monday. But after chairing a meeting of the government's crisis committee, COBRA, Raab said no decision on lifting the government's stay-home order and business closures would be made ""until evidence clearly shows that we've moved beyond the peak"" of the outbreak. Raab said ""we're starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we've all made, but the deaths are still rising and we haven't yet reached the peak of the virus."" He said the government and its scientific experts would assess the evidence again next week. ""We mustn't give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and to hurt our country,"" Raab said. Almost 8000 people with the coronavirus have died in British hospitals, according to government figures. While the number of new confirmed cases has begun to plateau, deaths have neared the peaks seen in Italy and Spain, the two countries with the greatest number of fatalities. On Thursday, the UK reported 881 new deaths, down from the 938 recorded the day before. Italy recorded a high of 969 deaths on March 27 and Spain 950 deaths on April 2. The number of people in intensive care units for coronavirus infection in France fell slightly for the first time since the start of the epidemic, but the number of people dying in nursing homes jumped by more than 50 per cent over two days, health ministry data showed on Thursday. Health Ministry Director Jerome Salomon said that the number of people in ICU fell by 82 or 1.1 per cent to 7066, five days after Italy also had seen that number falling. The figures may not be directly comparable, however. Not all the UK deaths reported each day occurred in the preceding 24 hours, and the total only includes deaths in hospitals – it does not include aged care homes. British officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Currently most parks remain open and people are allowed to go outside for essential work, shopping and exercise. While most Britons have observed the rules, there have been breaches. Police in the northern city of Manchester said they had broken up 660 parties over the past two weeks, including some with DJs and fireworks. Nick Adderley, the chief of Northamptonshire Police in central England, said on Thursday that his officers might have to set up road blocks and start ""checking the items in [shopping] baskets and trolleys to see whether it's a legitimate, necessary item."" Civil liberties group Big Brother Watch called those comments ""outrageous"" and Adderley later clarified that his officers would not be inspecting people's shopping. Johnson's government was slower than those in some European countries to impose restrictions on daily life in response to the pandemic, leading his critics to accuse him of complacency. Britain also had one of the lowest numbers of hospital beds per capita in western Europe before the pandemic, with only about 5000 intensive care beds nationwide. That number has been increased vastly in the past few weeks, both by converting other areas of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and by building temporary facilities, including a 4000-bed hospital at London's Excel conference centre. So far, hospitals have been stretched but not overwhelmed. However some medics say they are struggling and still have not received adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, or PPE ""We're still, by and large, wearing the same equipment that we were a few weeks ago,"" said Dr Nishant Joshi, an accident and emergency doctor who works in a hospital north of London.

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu denies the accusations from the WHO director general.Credit:AP The ministry expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and a high degree of regret, and raised the most solemn protest."" Taiwan is a ""mature, highly sophisticated nation and could never instigate personal attacks on the director-general of the WHO, much less express racist sentiments,"" the statement said. Taiwan's 23 million people have themselves been ""severely discriminated against"" by the politics of the international health system and ""condemn all forms of discrimination and injustice,"" the statement said. On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused Taiwan's foreign ministry of being linked to a months-long campaign against him amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a press briefing, Tedros said that since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, he has been personally attacked, including receiving at times, death threats and racist abuse. ""This attack came from Taiwan,"" said Tedros, who is a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister and the WHO's first African leader. Replay   He said Taiwanese diplomats were aware of the attacks but did not dissociate themselves from them. ""They even started criticising me in the middle of all those insults and slurs,"" Tedros said. ""I say it today because it's enough."" The basis of his allegations were unclear. Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing's claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the US. At China's insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the UN and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak. Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths. US and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island's participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei. Also at Wednesday's briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO's response to the outbreak.

Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu denies the accusations from the WHO director general.Credit:AP The ministry expressed ""strong dissatisfaction and a high degree of regret, and raised the most solemn protest."" Taiwan is a ""mature, highly sophisticated nation and could never instigate personal attacks on the director-general of the WHO, much less express racist sentiments,"" the statement said. Taiwan's 23 million people have themselves been ""severely discriminated against"" by the politics of the international health system and ""condemn all forms of discrimination and injustice,"" the statement said. On Wednesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused Taiwan's foreign ministry of being linked to a months-long campaign against him amid the COVID-19 pandemic. At a press briefing, Tedros said that since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, he has been personally attacked, including receiving at times, death threats and racist abuse. ""This attack came from Taiwan,"" said Tedros, who is a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister and the WHO's first African leader. Replay   He said Taiwanese diplomats were aware of the attacks but did not dissociate themselves from them. ""They even started criticising me in the middle of all those insults and slurs,"" Tedros said. ""I say it today because it's enough."" The basis of his allegations were unclear. Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing's claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the US. At China's insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the UN and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak. Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths. US and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island's participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei. Also at Wednesday's briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO's response to the outbreak. The vocal defence came a day after Trump blasted the agency for being ""China- centric"" and alleging that it had ""criticised"" his ban of travel from China as the COVID-19 outbreak was spreading from the city of Wuhan.

The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by UN special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Medical staff set up a coronavirus quarantine ward at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen.Credit:AP The ceasefire will go into effect at midday on Thursday, Yemen time, for two weeks and is open to extension, he said in a statement. The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities. The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen.

Credit:AP ""[Our proposal] will lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces. Last week, UN envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen. Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace."" A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the US Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"". The UN and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities. Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Saudi Vice-Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $US500 million ($800 million) to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $US25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus.

A destroyed building in Luganville, Vanuatu.Credit:AAP Cyclone Harold ripped through Vanuatu and Fiji as a deadly top-strength storm this week, causing injuries and damage to property, and severing communications. Before that, it left 27 people missing and presumed dead in the Solomon Islands after they were swept off a ferry in rough seas. The storm is now headed toward Tonga and expected to land there on Thursday or Friday, emergency officials said. The cyclone forced Vanuatu, which has yet to report a case of the COVID-19 infection, to suspend social distancing rules intended to combat the virus, Red Cross officials said. The island state's leaders also are rethinking new border restrictions imposed to head off a virus outbreak, they said. “It’s an incredibly challenging time right across the globe, and it’s hard to imagine a worse time for a mega-storm like this to hit,” Luke Ebbs, Vanuatu director for charity Save the Children, said in a statement. Josephine Latu-Sanft, a Tongan-born communications director for The Commonwealth - whose members include more than 20 small island states - said the storm had thrown the islands' pandemic preparations into question, and left nations that have few resources struggling to deal with two crises at once. Fiji, for instance, has about 15 cases of COVID-19 and no deaths yet, but will find it hard to maintain a lockdown to tame the disease's spread while dealing with the storm's aftermath, she said. Replay   In many islands in the South Pacific, ""that’s where the worry is"", she added. ""If they have to lift that (lockdown) to put everybody in a church or evacuate a rural area, that's a problem."" Tonga has just ""a handful"" of intensive care beds for a population of 100,000, to treat both storm injuries and potential cases of the novel coronavirus, Latu-Sanft said. Many people also fear that visitors bringing in storm aid or other supplies from abroad could unwittingly introduce the virus in places where it has yet to take hold. For small islands, working to prevent a COVID-19 crisis ""doesn't mean all the other issues you're dealing with go away"", Latu-Sanft told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Patricia Scotland, secretary-general of The Commonwealth and a native of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, said lessons learnt in the South Pacific may soon have wider implications. Both the Atlantic hurricane season and South Asia monsoon, for example, begin in June, and could bring flooding and other threats even as countries are likely to be still grappling with COVID-19. ""If we're not careful we may have the perfect storm,"" Scotland warned in a telephone interview. Economic shutdowns associated with efforts to control the virus also will make it harder for many people to cope with potential climate-related disasters at the same time. Communities that rely on fishing, for instance, can no longer sell to restaurants or broader markets, and tourism is on hold as travel bans are put in place. ""If no one's flying and there's no tourism and no one is buying your fish, you're really looking at an economic disaster as well,"" Scotland said. Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said aid agencies and climate change experts have long been concerned about more countries and communities facing multiple crises - from health emergencies to conflict outbreaks or weather disasters - all at once. The current pandemic is now expanding that risk to many parts of the world beyond the poorest and most conflict-affected countries, he said. ""Are we going to see a lot more of this? Absolutely,"" he added. Reuters Copyright © 2020", Laurie Goering ,"April 9, 2020"

The island state's leaders also are rethinking new border restrictions imposed to head off a virus outbreak, they said. “It’s an incredibly challenging time right across the globe, and it’s hard to imagine a worse time for a mega-storm like this to hit,” Luke Ebbs, Vanuatu director for charity Save the Children, said in a statement. Josephine Latu-Sanft, a Tongan-born communications director for The Commonwealth - whose members include more than 20 small island states - said the storm had thrown the islands' pandemic preparations into question, and left nations that have few resources struggling to deal with two crises at once. Fiji, for instance, has about 15 cases of COVID-19 and no deaths yet, but will find it hard to maintain a lockdown to tame the disease's spread while dealing with the storm's aftermath, she said. Replay   In many islands in the South Pacific, ""that’s where the worry is"", she added. ""If they have to lift that (lockdown) to put everybody in a church or evacuate a rural area, that's a problem."" Tonga has just ""a handful"" of intensive care beds for a population of 100,000, to treat both storm injuries and potential cases of the novel coronavirus, Latu-Sanft said. Many people also fear that visitors bringing in storm aid or other supplies from abroad could unwittingly introduce the virus in places where it has yet to take hold. For small islands, working to prevent a COVID-19 crisis ""doesn't mean all the other issues you're dealing with go away"", Latu-Sanft told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Patricia Scotland, secretary-general of The Commonwealth and a native of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, said lessons learnt in the South Pacific may soon have wider implications. Both the Atlantic hurricane season and South Asia monsoon, for example, begin in June, and could bring flooding and other threats even as countries are likely to be still grappling with COVID-19. ""If we're not careful we may have the perfect storm,"" Scotland warned in a telephone interview. Economic shutdowns associated with efforts to control the virus also will make it harder for many people to cope with potential climate-related disasters at the same time. Communities that rely on fishing, for instance, can no longer sell to restaurants or broader markets, and tourism is on hold as travel bans are put in place. ""If no one's flying and there's no tourism and no one is buying your fish, you're really looking at an economic disaster as well,"" Scotland said. Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said aid agencies and climate change experts have long been concerned about more countries and communities facing multiple crises - from health emergencies to conflict outbreaks or weather disasters - all at once. The current pandemic is now expanding that risk to many parts of the world beyond the poorest and most conflict-affected countries, he said. ""Are we going to see a lot more of this? Absolutely,"" he added. Reuters Copyright © 2020", Laurie Goering ,"April 9, 2020"

In just a few years, enormous warehouses and office buildings servicing international oil companies have sprung up amid the shrub land, irrigation canals and fields of wild cane. People are ""moving from cutting cane to businessmen,"" said Mona Harisha, a local shop owner. ""It changed so fast."" A fraught transformation is underway in Guyana, as oil riches bring optimism but also intensify ethnic tensions and environmental concerns. Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times Guyana is giving up its past as an agricultural economy and speeding toward its near-term future as an oil-producing giant. And so Harisha has renovated her general store, redolent of Indian spices, which she runs from a side of her cottage in the Houston neighbourhood of Georgetown, the county's capital. She said oil companies have brought jobs and better roads, and have raised home values — and brought new business to her shop. Her daughter is thinking of returning from New York, an example of how the government is enticing a huge diaspora home with promises of the oil bounty. Stabroek Market, Georgetown’s busiest street market, where half of the stores closed after tensions arose from the March 2 elections.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times For many, the transformation into an oil economy has brought optimism about greater prosperity. But that optimism is often mixed with a fatalism that nothing will really improve for the vast majority of people in one of South America's poorest countries. Once home to 3000 sugar workers, the abandoned Houston sugar estate has gradually been absorbed into the suburban sprawl of Georgetown. About 100 families still live in the uniform one-story cottages built by the state sugar company for workers in the 1960s. For them, the recent changes have brought opportunity. Like most of Houston's residents, Harisha's ancestors came to Guyana as indentured labourers from India in the late 19th century to replace enslaved Africans on the sugar plantations after the British, who then ruled Guyana as a colony, abolished the slave trade. Sugar workers in Skeldon, Guyana, where the closing of cane-processing plants has left thousands unemployed.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times When the labourers' contracts expired, some stayed, becoming the largest ethnic group and helping shape a unique, vibrant culture, which looks outward to the Caribbean rather than to its Latin American neighbours. While the effects of the giant oil discoveries off Guyana's coast are most obvious in and around Georgetown, they are now beginning to extend a little further beyond the capital, too. In a brick shack on the edge of the jungle 25 kilometres away, Jason Bobb-Semple, 25, is making his own big bet on oil. With a $US3000 ($4800) government loan, he built a small poultry farm and bought 4000 chicks to meet what he expects to be a booming food demand in a rapidly developing country. ""After all this oil,"" Bobb-Semple said, people will want to eat. ""These are my hopes."" Jason Bobb-Semple’s wife, Rosalene, on their small poultry farm in Georgetown, Guyana, built with a government loan.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times Just hours after Bobb-Semple received the chicks, he got a visit from his first potential investor, a Guyanese emigre businessman who was back home looking for eggs to sell to the offshore oil rigs. The investor, Lancelot Myers, said oil companies currently have to import most of their provisions, providing a business opportunity to local entrepreneurs who can fill supply gaps. ""Now is the time to hit the ground running,"" he said. The enterprising energy of the Guyanese seeking to benefit from the oil boom contrasts sharply with the deep depression, both economic and psychological, reining in the rural sugar belt, which had powered this country's economy since the 17th century. A decision by President David Granger to shut down most of Guyana's unprofitable, state-owned cane processing plants in 2018 left about 7000 sugar workers unemployed, devastating the surrounding regions. The closures have turned places like Skeldon in the fertile east of the country into ghost towns, wiping out the once-vibrant local markets and businesses that used to serve the sugar workers. Bands of former cane cutters aimlessly roam Skeldon's streets or pass the time in fast-food shops without eating, despairing of finding another job. ""This country was created out of sugar. I lived my life in that industry,"" said Ferdinand Guptar, a 59-year-old unemployed cane cutter in Skeldon, who now does household chores for his wife while she cleans the floors at a school for $US200 a month. ""It's depressing when your wife has to take care of you,"" he said. The lay-offs inflamed ethnic tensions, with the mainly Indo-Guyanese sugar workers accusing Granger's predominantly black government of targeted economic repression. According to the latest census, ethnic Indians comprise 40 per cent of Guyana's population of about 750,000, compared with 30 per cent for the Afro-Guyanese. The indigenous communities, about 10 per cent of the population, provide the country's traditional swing vote. ""Sometimes it's not just about profitability, but the quality of people's lives,"" said David Armogan, governor of Skeldon's region, referring to his opposition to the sugar plant closures. ""This is more about vindictiveness than economics."" Workers wait for a storm to pass before continuing to repair a breached sea wall in Mahaicony, Guyana.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times These ethnic tensions reached a fever pitch during the March 2 elections, whose aftermath has descended into a bitter, inconclusive contest between Granger and the main opposition party backed primarily by ethnic Indians. The outcome remains undecided, and the country is still at a political standoff. The financial stakes of the political conflict are enormous, as oil revenues are expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars into government coffers in the years ahead. The election was largely a referendum on how Guyana should spend that windfall. The ruling party advocates using the money to retrain agricultural workers for the public and service sectors. The opposition instead wants to subsidise sugar farms to keep rural communities alive. The first small-scale oil exports started in January. While the money that the government will see in 2020 is just a fraction of what's coming when output reaches 1.2 million barrels day at the end of this decade, one-third of the state's budget this year still is expected to come from oil revenue. The International Monetary Fund projected that Guyana's tiny economy would grow by 86 per cent this year, the fastest rate in the world. That forecast, however, is likely to take a major hit from the sudden collapse of oil prices, the coronavirus pandemic and Guyana's ongoing political paralysis. To Guyana's small but vocal group of environmentalists, the country's polarised politics and ethnic grievances distract from its existential problems as it becomes a major contributor to fossil fuel consumption. Along the country's densely populated central coast, rising sea levels brought on by climate change are gradually overwhelming a system of dikes first built hundreds of years ago by the Dutch colonialists who preceded the British. Nine out of 10 people in Guyana live below or near sea level. Each day for the past five months, a road gang has toiled on a Sisyphean task along the muddy Atlantic Coast, trying to fill a breach in near 100km sea wall with stones and sand. Each week, the tide washes away their efforts. ""It keeps getting worse, until you can't control it,"" said Joree Shoturem, an ex-farmer in the village of Broom Hall near Georgetown whose rice fields were ruined by the creeping salt water and whose sheep and cows were swept away. ""The repairs have had no good result."" Despite the futility, Shoturem has resigned himself to his new government job. With no farm, he has joined the work crew, ceaselessly lobbing piles of dirt into an advancing ocean. ""People don't make the connection between the rising tides and the fossil fuel,"" said Annette Arjoon, a local businesswoman and environmentalist. ""Unless we have a real national conversation, we'll use the oil revenues to build higher sea walls."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Anatoly Kurmanaev ,"April 8, 2020"

""There are currently no fevers on board and all are asymptomatic,"" said Aurora Expeditions, the Australian operator of the Greg Mortimer ship that is working to disembark the crew and passengers and arrange flights to their home countries. Many of the passengers on the Greg Mortimer cruise ship, pictured, are Australians. The Greg Mortimer departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia that was titled In Shackleton's Footsteps, a reference to the polar explorer who led British expeditions to the region and died there in 1922. Of 217 people tested on the vessel, 128 were positive for the virus that causes the COVID-2019 disease and 89 tested negative, Aurora Expeditions said. Another six people who were evacuated from the ship are in stable condition and being treated in Montevideo. Replay   The people on the ship are calm but they are eager to go home, said Marcelo Girard, a doctor at a Uruguayan medical facility where two people from the Greg Mortimer are being treated. Australian passengers, and possibly those from New Zealand, are likely to fly home on Thursday or Friday on an Airbus 340 that has been refitted - with people who have the virus and those who do not travelling in separate cabin areas, according to Aurora Expeditions. The cost per passenger is about $15,025 and the cruise ship operator has asked the Australian government for help with expenses. The plan would require the passengers to undergo a 14-day quarantine on arrival at a facility in Melbourne, the company said. US and European passengers who tested negative will hopefully be able to depart later in the week, following a second test and permission from the Uruguayan government, Aurora Expeditions said. Those who tested positive must wait until they test negative before flying home.
