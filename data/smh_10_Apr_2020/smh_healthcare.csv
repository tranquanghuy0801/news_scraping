While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. The question of how easily the new coronavirus can spread in the air is still up for debate.Credit:AP A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk from aerosols may have been underestimated. Warning signs are piling up, Professor Morawska says - the virus rips through a cruise ship even after passengers are isolated in their cabins, a choir meets in Washington and 45 out of the 60 singers leave the two hour rehearsal infected even though none have symptoms. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet. They can leave the body as both. “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. The Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading frequently in the air. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would likely look different- spreading faster and amongst more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results - some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska noted, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours, but it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier this month saying the current research supports the possibility COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus mostly aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO has warned healthcare workers this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 already operate as if it's airborne, including in Australia. ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put frontline workers at risk. But in the US, the CDC has reversed its own advice, now urging people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as in a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Professor Morawska agreed with the masks push, adding there should be more focus on the need for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. She is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for aerosol transmission. Associate Professor Senanayake said air conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the department agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low in hospitals. A spokeswoman said Australia's advice on masks had not changed on Thursday but the evidence on transmission was being reviewed all the time by the medical experts advising government. Professor MacIntyre and Associate Professor Senanayake said wearing masks in public was not so urgent for Australia compared to New York where there was rampant community transmission. “Perhaps somewhere like Sydney, where they’ve had local outbreaks they could help,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. ""But everyone just rushing out and wearing a mask won’t."" NSW Health said air conditioners and heating were considered safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and if possible, use a different bathroom...to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets...and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne.""

Many of the injuries being treated at the hospital's burns unit have been caused by hot oil with others resulting from people cooking while intoxicated. Associate Professor Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had noted a significant increase in patients with severe cooking-related burns. “We’ve seen burns from hot cooking oil catching fire, barbecue-related burns and scald burns from hot liquids,"" Associate Professor Cleland said. ""These burns usually involve hands, arms and faces. Frequently, people who are trying to deal with burning oil, pick it up and try and take it outside but what usually happens is the oil spills on them or they fall and slip into a puddle of burning oil. Replay   ""Sometimes, they open the back door and they get a big gust of air that makes the flames go up even further."" Associate Professor Cleland said more than half the burns unit was filled with people who had sustained kitchen, domestic or home-cooking injuries. Several of those had also been in the intensive care unit. ""People are ending up in intensive care beds with these injuries at a time when those beds are going to become very precious,"" she said. Across Australia intensive care units have yet to be overwhelmed with coronavirus patients – 13 people are being treated across Victoria for example – but authorities are expecting numbers to climb dramatically in May and June. The physical-distancing restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus have brought something of a lull to emergency rooms but unlike other trauma-related injuries such as those seen after car crashes burn injuries are on the rise.  ""Which is why we are trying to alert people to the fact these types of injuries can require admission to hospital, sometimes for weeks, and involve time in the intensive care unit, surgery and result in long-term scarring,"" Associate Professor Cleland. ""These are not trivial, minor injuries."" Associate Professor Cleland said the most common causes of cooking burns included hot oil catching fire, people being burnt after throwing accelerant on barbecues, clothes catching fire while cooking, spilling large saucepans of boiling water and splash burns from boiling water, hot oil or fat. “I also need to remind people once again that accelerant and flames do not mix,"" she said. ""We’ve seen a number of people badly burnt after pouring accelerant onto barbecues."" Associate Professor Cleland said the hospital had treated a broad range of age groups for cooking injuries because people were spending more time in their homes than they otherwise would.

Associate Professor Cleland was particularly concerned about older people who were over-represented among the burns patients being admitted to hospital.

""They generally have poorer health outcomes too, when they do suffer burns."" Smothering the flames with an extinguisher or a fire blanket is the best practice, Associate Professor Cleland said. ""Clearly, the thing to do when you've got something like burning oil is to smother it,"" she said.

The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said.

Most people infected in the viral pandemic now sweeping the globe will come down with only a mild case of the mystery illness. Some won’t know they’ve had it at all. But when it's bad, it can mount an attack on the whole body – and start a storm in the lungs. How it plays out depends on the two factors important to any invasion: the strength of your defences and the strength (or dose) of what you’ve been hit with. Connor Reed, 25, knows well the racking cough and spiking fever of the illness now called COVID-19. He says he came down with it late last year in the centre of the initial outbreak, Wuhan in China. He still lives just a 20-minute walk from the wet market where it's believed the strain jumped from wild animals into humans.  At first, Reed seemed to just have a cold. A week on, then early December, he was already feeling better when a fever hit, and a cough. His whole body started to ache. Another week went by. He thought he was on the mend until the cough became deeper, seeming to settle at the bottom of his lungs. ""It was hard to breathe,"" Reed says. ""Even walking to the bathroom, I felt like I was running out of air. My ears hurt from it, I lost my balance at times. It started to get scary, like the worst flu I've ever had."" Reed ended up in hospital and, after a full day of testing, he says doctors told him he had a ""new kind of pneumonia"". Fortunately, he was fit and healthy: his life didn't appear to be in danger. Steroid inhalers helped reduce inflammation in his lungs and, more than a month after that first sniffle, Reed recovered. When he called the hospital in early January to ask more about his test results, they told him what was about to hit headlines around the world in just a matter of days – a new kind of coronavirus had been identified in humans. Reed was one of the earliest suspected cases. Four months on, what do we now know about COVID-19 and how the body reacts? What is treatment like? And how long does recovery take? Connor Reed, 25, in Wuhan, China. Having recovered from one of the earliest suspected cases of the coronavirus COVID-19, he is hoping to return to Brisbane, Australia.Credit:Facebook You can’t see the virus with the naked eye – it’s nanometres wide. But when someone is infected, they can shed it, shooting viral particles at least a metre into the air in water droplets from their nose and mouth, usually through coughing or sneezing. Viruses infect a new host by harnessing our own cellular machinery to replicate. To get in, they need the key – a receptor within a cell they can bind to. Which cell a virus latches onto largely determines where it will spread throughout the body – and helps guide treatment. The four main coronaviruses found in humans tend to colonise only the nose and throat. Collectively, they cause about one in four cases of the common cold and symptoms are mild: a runny nose, a sore throat, sometimes a cough or a fever. But since 2003, three dangerous coronavirus illnesses have emerged in humans: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also spawned global panic when it exploded onto the scene 20 years ago, the more deadly but less common MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and now the latest, COVID-19, which has already infected more than 1.5 million people and killed about 95,000. All three attack the lungs as well as the sinuses, sometimes developing into viral pneumonia – and, because they're new, there's little natural immunity to fight them off. COVID-19 is about 75 per cent similar to the SARS strain, and even thought to bind to the same cell receptors (ACE2), which are largely found in the lungs. Early studies suggest this virus might be better at hacking into that receptor than SARS, which is why it's more infectious, says Professor Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. A spokesman for the Australian Department of Health offered a different theory: the new virus appears to be replicating fastest in the nose and throat, rather than the lungs. That could make it more transmissible but also perhaps less fatal than the other two coronavirus outbreaks. To find the virus, doctors need to catch it in the act, either by swabbing a sample directly from the nose and throat or in lung phlegm or by singling out the body’s immune response to the infection in a blood test. The new strain has already been found in the lungs, nose, throat, even in faeces, says infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre. It can hitch a ride in the bloodstream to other organs such as the kidneys, liver, intestines and possibly the heart, brain and central nervous system, too. But both methods of testing can return false negatives - a throat or nasal swab can miss the virus (because it's actually replicating lower down in the lungs) and a blood test, which is not yet widely available outside of China, can be performed too early - some people will take up to 9 days to produce antibodies to fight off a virus. Professor Lewin adds, ""Early on, you had doctors in China diagnosing just off chest scans because you can see that lung inflammation, even if it's not severe."" Now, Sydney scientists have developed a fast training tool to help frontline healthcare workers spot COVID-19 in lung scans. Still, infectious disease physician and microbiologist Professor Peter Collignon says it’s not yet clear if everyone gets the new virus in their lungs. “Finding it down there isn't a tipping point [for severity] by any means. Some children have it in their lungs but display no symptoms,"" he says. ""But it might not have travelled all the way down from the upper respiratory area in every case."" Much of what we know about COVID-19 comes from studies of the first 55,000-odd cases in China, which found more than 80 per cent of people could fight off the illness without serious complications, even if they developed pneumonia. Lungs cleared, coughs eased and fevers broke. Anecdotally, some people have likened the infection to ""three weeks in hell"", racked by chills and struggling to breathe, while others have reported only a sore throat, a small cough, even no symptoms at all. Hollywood actor Tom Hanks offered an early public glimpse into life as a COVID-19 patient on March 11 when he revealed he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had both tested positive while in Australia shooting his latest film From hospital isolation on the Gold Coast, Hanks wrote of the illness's onset: ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too."" More public figures from actor Idris Elba to Prime Minister Boris Johnson have since been diagnosed. ""I've developed mild symptoms,"" Johnson said from isolation at home on March 27. ""That is to say, a fever and a persistent cough."" When his fever remained high more than 10 days later, he was moved to hospital, and then briefly into intensive care, but he now remains stable back in his ward. Based on data collected in China, most patients seem to have: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat, and nausea or diarrhoea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS. Less than five per cent of cases so far involve a blocked nose. With early symptoms deceptively similar to the common cold or flu, one sign of infection may be a loss of smell (and an accompanying reduction in taste), as the virus attacks that part of the respiratory system. Sometimes people infected with the virus who otherwise feel fine will find they cannot smell as usual - though experts say the effects are not permanent and the sudden loss of the sense is far from a ""test"" for the virus. (Not all patients report losing smell and the symptom is also associated with other common colds and viruses). In the case of COVID-19, Professor Collignon says patients generally appear to have mild symptoms for the first week or so. In severe cases, they can intensify into pneumonia during the second and, in rarer cases, the infection will turn unexpectedly deadly.  At the World Health Organisation, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward warns when danger strikes, it's often fast-moving. Doctors report patients can go downhill quickly during those ""critical"" second and third weeks and urge people with or suspected to have the virus to monitor their symptoms, particularly their breathing and fever. Infectious diseases physician Sanjaya Senanayake says he's seen patients develop ""bad shortness of breath"" around the second week of symptoms. ""Then if they're going to get very sick, about two and a half days later, they [usually] start to develop fluid in their lungs.""

The man died 10 days after the final scan.Credit:The Lancet medical journal  On scans, they call it ground glass – a white mist over the usual empty black of the lungs. In some cases, there are bright spots, eerily similar to the “honeycomb-shaped” lesions left by SARS, but mostly COVID-19 makes a finer and more-even pattern across both lungs. This inflammation is a sign the body is fighting back against the virus – in that battle, the lungs are ground zero. But Professor Collignon warns sometimes the collateral damage can be worse than the bug itself. As the immune system ramps up its defences, blood vessels start to leak and the lungs can be flooded with cellular debris, making it harder for them to pump oxygen to the rest of the body – and harder for patients to draw breath. ""They start to drown,"" Professor Collignon says. Falling blood oxygen levels put pressure on other organs, in particular the heart. More systems can start to fail, and blood pressure too, which, if it falls low enough can tip the body into septic shock, a whole-body infection. ""Even if the virus spreads to the heart or the kidneys and damages them, the real cause of death is still probably going to be oxygen levels falling and setting everything else off,"" Professor Collignon says. ""If you're an older person or already unwell and those organs are weaker, it can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."" While there is a theory that people with already compromised immune systems might escape this effect and so cope with an infection better than expected, Professor Collignon warns they are especially vulnerable to the other big killer – co-infection. Usually being hit with two bugs at once is rare, though not impossible. But as the virus chews through cells, it leaves the lungs less able to filter out germs picked up from the nose and throat – and wide open to a case of the flu or even a bout of bacterial pneumonia. (The first man to die from COVID-19 in Thailand was also sick with dengue fever.) During the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, most victims died not from the original virus but due to these second-wave bacterial pneumonia infections. Fortunately medicine has advanced a lot since then, making such complications much easier to treat. So far, the WHO reports about 20 per cent of cases become severe, requiring medical intervention for serious breathing difficulties and falling blood oxygen levels. Of those, 6 per cent have been pushed into critical care – as multiple organs begin to fail alongside the lungs or septic shock sets in. About 3.4 per cent have died. But experts expect the real death rate is actually much lower, given so many mild cases will likely go undiagnosed. While anyone can catch the virus, older people and those with other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are most at risk of fatal complications. (""Over the age of 50, the immune system starts to fall apart,"" Professor MacIntyre explains). But in Italy, where the virus has gained a particularly deadly foothold, doctors warn that younger patients (in their 30s, 40s and 50s) were also presenting to overwhelmed emergency departments needing help to breathe. Some have even raised the prospect of an age limit for intensive care to free up beds for younger cases as life-saving machines such as ventilators become worth their weight in gold. Data since complied from elsewhere in Europe and North America also reflects a concerning number of hospitalisations among people under 55, prompting warnings for younger adults to take COVID-19 more seriously. As of April 6, 448 of Australia's then 5795 cases were in hospital, 96 of them in intensive care. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said many of those people were young - in their 30s. ""This is not just an old person's disease,"" he said. ""Those young people don't have [other] risk factors."" While so far those who have died in Australia have been over 50, people in their 20s have seen the highest number of coronavirus infections of any age bracket. So far internationally very few children have been diagnosed or suffered serious cases globally – a phenomenon also observed during SARS. Still, they are not immune and some have died from the illness, including the heart-breaking case of a six-week old baby in the US. Smokers are considered more at risk, as early studies show the same cell receptors the virus hijacks in the lungs increase with cigarette smoke. But pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers so far do not appear in any heightened danger, as they were during the last pandemic, the 2009 swine flu. Still they should take precautions as they are known to be more susceptible to other common respiratory viruses. Whatever your personal vulnerability, the dose of virus you first receive – say, from touching a contaminated door knob versus caring for an infected person over several days – also plays a big part in how your body copes. ""The higher the dose the faster you will get sick, and the harder it will be on you,"" Professor MacIntyre says. That could explain why otherwise young and healthy medical workers have died from the disease. Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old doctor who blew the whistle on early cases of COVID-19, went through a gamut of treatments after falling ill himself, including antivirals, antibiotics, even having his blood pumped through an artificial lung, but he died weeks later. As with SARS, clusters of severe infection are emerging in hospitals and households as people come into sustained close contact. Despite the breakneck speed of global research, a vaccine for COVID-19 is still many months away. And, while antivirals and therapies that block diseases such as malaria, Ebola and HIV are being trialled against the new disease in some parts of the world, including Australia, treatment is largely about managing complications – providing oxygen, keeping up fluids and monitoring how the body is coping. Antibiotics don't work on the virus as it is not caused by bacteria but they can be deployed against secondary infections. If breathing starts to fall, respirators and other measures will kick in to keep the lungs going. As Professor Lewin explains, doctors have a key choice when treating any new virus: is it better to block it directly with antiviral therapies as in the case of HIV or should they also dampen down the body's immune response using drugs such as Interferon, to minimise the fall-out damage? ""Sometimes that can help but sometimes it means the infection overwhelms,"" Professor Lewin says. ""It didn't work with SARS but there's been some success with MERS. Already for this, there's been candidate [therapies] that look good in test tubes, but we need trials. China has about 70 going, testing different [approaches] but they're actually struggling to enrol people now as cases fall."" No vaccine exists for either SARS or MERS - the former died out within about nine months so an inoculation never hit the market while the less common MERS has struggled to attract research funding since it emerged in 2012. After the big Ebola outbreak of 2014, a global group formed to speed up research into vaccines and MERS was recently identified as a priority. ""Then this new one hit,"" Professor Lewin says. Professor Collignon thinks it unlikely any of the potential treatments now being tested against COVID-19 will save the day before a vaccine hits the market – without larger trials, he warns, small studies can miss big problems on roll-out. Experts also warn of increased pressure on hospitals  if severe coronavirus cases hit wards all at once. While Australia's healthcare system is strong compared to other countries, it's population is also older, Professor MacIntyre notes, meaning more demand for intensive care. To slow down the virus and avoid a ""pinch"" around flu season, Australia has followed other countries in rolling out stricter containment measures such as quarantining suspected cases, shutting down gatherings and ordering people to stay home except for essential reasons. So far it appears to be working - a surge in new infections in mid-March has now begun to flatten. Most people with COVID-19 present to hospital because they're having trouble breathing, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. Once admitted and getting oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but others will need ventilators or other machines to keep their lungs and organs working. Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a breathing machine known as a ventilator, whether they know it or not. But Dr Suzi Nou at the Australian Society of Anaesthetists says that while a patient having routine surgery will need a ventilator for minutes or hours – perhaps a few days in intensive care – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. Australia is already doubling the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to 4000 - some are being freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery. But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou. It's those doctors and nurses who will need help to keep coming to work in the weeks and months ahead, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Retired healthcare workers as well as medical students are now being drafted into the fight. Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” Replay   Professor MacIntyre says it's too early to say if this disease will result in any permanent damage for severe cases– such as the lung tissue scarring seen in some SARS and MERS patients. But a full recovery typically takes about 10 days to a month. Symptoms tend to clear up within a fortnight in mild cases or six weeks for more serious, Associate Professor Senanayake says.  Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. So far, more than 300,000 people have already recovered worldwide. With these virus-fighting antibodies in their system, many experts expect they will remain immune for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Recovering from a virus usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. For COVID-19, there have already been cases of people cleared of the virus, only to test positive again days later or, in the case of one woman, more than a month down the line. But while experts say it's possible to be re-infected again, it's more likely the virus was still in their system. Some studies have even suggested it can lie dormant in other parts of the body for weeks - with the longest period of infectiousness recorded as 37 days so far. ""But in some cases, when people are returning persistently positive tests after getting better, they might be finding dead virus,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. Amid a shortage of testing kits world-wide, Australia is only retesting frontline staff in health and aged care to confirm their recovery. That means official recovery data remains patchy. Most patients are instead told to wait 72 hours after symptoms disappear (provided they have already isolated for 10 days from illness onset). A federal government spokesman also said a patient who keeps testing positive after symptoms vanish is not necessarily still infectious. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve,"" he said. Back in Wuhan, Reed was cleared to leave his own home quarantine months ago but, like tens of millions of people in China, he'd spent the first three months of 2020 under lockdown in an unprecedented government effort to stem the virus's spread. On April 8, the streets finally opened again - residents waved flags and sang songs as they left their homes for the first time in 11 weeks. While the local government did not appear to pick up early cases of the virus, Reed says China took the right step, however extreme, in shutting down parts of the country - the government's data says new infections have all but stopped within its borders, even as new frontiers of the virus rage in the US and Europe. ""In Italy, it seems to be a similar thing to Wuhan,"" Reed says. ""The virus was there, but people didn't notice, it was brewing quietly for a while, and then it suddenly exploded. Now they've followed China with lockdowns. Australians need to take this seriously."" Reed was born in the UK but is now hoping to return to Brisbane, where he grew up and his family still live.

Most people infected in the viral pandemic now sweeping the globe will come down with only a mild case of the mystery illness. Some won’t know they’ve had it at all. But when it's bad, it can mount an attack on the whole body – and start a storm in the lungs. How it plays out depends on the two factors important to any invasion: the strength of your defences and the strength (or dose) of what you’ve been hit with. Connor Reed, 25, knows well the racking cough and spiking fever of the illness now called COVID-19. He says he came down with it late last year in the centre of the initial outbreak, Wuhan in China. He still lives just a 20-minute walk from the wet market where it's believed the strain jumped from wild animals into humans.  At first, Reed seemed to just have a cold. A week on, then early December, he was already feeling better when a fever hit, and a cough. His whole body started to ache. Another week went by. He thought he was on the mend until the cough became deeper, seeming to settle at the bottom of his lungs. ""It was hard to breathe,"" Reed says. ""Even walking to the bathroom, I felt like I was running out of air. My ears hurt from it, I lost my balance at times. It started to get scary, like the worst flu I've ever had."" Reed ended up in hospital and, after a full day of testing, he says doctors told him he had a ""new kind of pneumonia"". Fortunately, he was fit and healthy: his life didn't appear to be in danger. Steroid inhalers helped reduce inflammation in his lungs and, more than a month after that first sniffle, Reed recovered. When he called the hospital in early January to ask more about his test results, they told him what was about to hit headlines around the world in just a matter of days – a new kind of coronavirus had been identified in humans. Reed was one of the earliest suspected cases. Four months on, what do we now know about COVID-19 and how the body reacts? What is treatment like? And how long does recovery take? Connor Reed, 25, in Wuhan, China. Having recovered from one of the earliest suspected cases of the coronavirus COVID-19, he is hoping to return to Brisbane, Australia.Credit:Facebook You can’t see the virus with the naked eye – it’s nanometres wide. But when someone is infected, they can shed it, shooting viral particles at least a metre into the air in water droplets from their nose and mouth, usually through coughing or sneezing. Viruses infect a new host by harnessing our own cellular machinery to replicate. To get in, they need the key – a receptor within a cell they can bind to. Which cell a virus latches onto largely determines where it will spread throughout the body – and helps guide treatment. The four main coronaviruses found in humans tend to colonise only the nose and throat. Collectively, they cause about one in four cases of the common cold and symptoms are mild: a runny nose, a sore throat, sometimes a cough or a fever. But since 2003, three dangerous coronavirus illnesses have emerged in humans: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also spawned global panic when it exploded onto the scene 20 years ago, the more deadly but less common MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and now the latest, COVID-19, which has already infected more than 1.5 million people and killed about 95,000. All three attack the lungs as well as the sinuses, sometimes developing into viral pneumonia – and, because they're new, there's little natural immunity to fight them off. COVID-19 is about 75 per cent similar to the SARS strain, and even thought to bind to the same cell receptors (ACE2), which are largely found in the lungs.

Professor Collignon thinks it unlikely any of the potential treatments now being tested against COVID-19 will save the day before a vaccine hits the market – without larger trials, he warns, small studies can miss big problems on roll-out. Experts also warn of increased pressure on hospitals  if severe coronavirus cases hit wards all at once. While Australia's healthcare system is strong compared to other countries, it's population is also older, Professor MacIntyre notes, meaning more demand for intensive care. To slow down the virus and avoid a ""pinch"" around flu season, Australia has followed other countries in rolling out stricter containment measures such as quarantining suspected cases, shutting down gatherings and ordering people to stay home except for essential reasons. So far it appears to be working - a surge in new infections in mid-March has now begun to flatten. Most people with COVID-19 present to hospital because they're having trouble breathing, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. Once admitted and getting oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but others will need ventilators or other machines to keep their lungs and organs working. Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a breathing machine known as a ventilator, whether they know it or not. But Dr Suzi Nou at the Australian Society of Anaesthetists says that while a patient having routine surgery will need a ventilator for minutes or hours – perhaps a few days in intensive care – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. Australia is already doubling the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to 4000 - some are being freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery. But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou. It's those doctors and nurses who will need help to keep coming to work in the weeks and months ahead, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Retired healthcare workers as well as medical students are now being drafted into the fight. Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” Replay   Professor MacIntyre says it's too early to say if this disease will result in any permanent damage for severe cases– such as the lung tissue scarring seen in some SARS and MERS patients. But a full recovery typically takes about 10 days to a month. Symptoms tend to clear up within a fortnight in mild cases or six weeks for more serious, Associate Professor Senanayake says.  Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. So far, more than 300,000 people have already recovered worldwide. With these virus-fighting antibodies in their system, many experts expect they will remain immune for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Recovering from a virus usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. For COVID-19, there have already been cases of people cleared of the virus, only to test positive again days later or, in the case of one woman, more than a month down the line. But while experts say it's possible to be re-infected again, it's more likely the virus was still in their system. Some studies have even suggested it can lie dormant in other parts of the body for weeks - with the longest period of infectiousness recorded as 37 days so far. ""But in some cases, when people are returning persistently positive tests after getting better, they might be finding dead virus,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. Amid a shortage of testing kits world-wide, Australia is only retesting frontline staff in health and aged care to confirm their recovery. That means official recovery data remains patchy. Most patients are instead told to wait 72 hours after symptoms disappear (provided they have already isolated for 10 days from illness onset). A federal government spokesman also said a patient who keeps testing positive after symptoms vanish is not necessarily still infectious. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve,"" he said. Back in Wuhan, Reed was cleared to leave his own home quarantine months ago but, like tens of millions of people in China, he'd spent the first three months of 2020 under lockdown in an unprecedented government effort to stem the virus's spread. On April 8, the streets finally opened again - residents waved flags and sang songs as they left their homes for the first time in 11 weeks. While the local government did not appear to pick up early cases of the virus, Reed says China took the right step, however extreme, in shutting down parts of the country - the government's data says new infections have all but stopped within its borders, even as new frontiers of the virus rage in the US and Europe. ""In Italy, it seems to be a similar thing to Wuhan,"" Reed says. ""The virus was there, but people didn't notice, it was brewing quietly for a while, and then it suddenly exploded. Now they've followed China with lockdowns. Australians need to take this seriously."" Reed was born in the UK but is now hoping to return to Brisbane, where he grew up and his family still live. ""I'm likely immune now, I feel fine, but I know I've gotten very lucky.

It is one of a number of cases of coronavirus with links to childcare in recent weeks, including the Rose of Sharon centre in Sydney that has confirmed 25 cases among the centre’s workers, children and other people who have come into contact with them. Last month, another Guardian centre, in East Ivanhoe, was connected to a further two cases. Two parents at the centre tested positive to COVID-19 after making multiple visits there with their child in mid-March. In that case, which is not thought to be linked to the recent infection, the centre remained open after management said it had received advice that the risk of transmission to children and other families was low.

10,/national/covid-19-by-the-numbers-a-snapshot-of-the-coronavirus-in-australia-20200317-p54b08.html,COVID-19 by the numbers: a live snapshot of the coronavirus in Australia,"Australians have watched the spread of the global coronavirus pandemic with a sense of foreboding. The Johns Hopkins University heatmap, which quickly became the go-to site to monitor the virus, has become an increasingly ominous image as its pulsing red dots have spread and grown like fire embers. We've watched as the virus erupted in Wuhan and threatened to engulf China. The dots have proliferated across continents – Asia, Europe, the Americas. Then COVID-19 reached Australia at the end of January. Progress of the disease has been captured in the visual snapshots with charts that are updated several times a day. Right now, the charts below give an up-to-date and cohesive view of COVID-19 across the country. Eventually, they will show something more than the progress of the virus. They will be a visual illustration of our response. They will show the effectiveness of the actions and decisions of governments, health authorities and citizens. Above, we can see the total number of COVID-19 cases in Australia over time. It made slow progress throughout February and began to surge in March. It started with 15 travellers who had been to China; all of those cases were specifically linked to Wuhan. At the end of February, passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship – which had been quarantined in Japan – were allowed to disembark, bringing another 10 cases home. This chart, above, was most useful towards the start of the pandemic in Australia. It showed how COVID-19 cases surged in March. (They were primarily driven by travellers importing the virus after catching it overseas. More on that later). But it is less useful as the pandemic continues because it does not tell us whether new confirmed cases are speeding up or slowing down. This chart, above, shows the number of new confirmed cases in Australia each day. (Numbers are progressively updated throughout the day as states and territories announce new cases. Therefore the final day in this chart is incomplete until all announcements have been made.) It tells us more than the first about the behaviour of the virus in Australia today. Coronavirus was spreading rapidly during March with case numbers jumping every day. In April, although we are still adding significant numbers of new cases each day, growth has slowed as the effects of travel restrictions, social distancing and shutdowns have taken effect. Above is a breakdown of total cases across states and territories. NSW clearly accounts for a significant part of Australia's growth in COVID-19 cases, however Victoria and Queensland saw sharp up-ticks also. (Depending on the time of day you're looking at this chart, you may see curves flatline at the end. That could be because there were no new cases that day, but it's probably because the state was yet to announce them. Best to check back later.) Like the first graph, the chart above shows linear curves that represent the total number of cases over time. You cannot use either of them – especially the trajectories – to gauge growth or compare Australia to other countries. To do that, we need to look at the next graph.   This chart, above, really starts to tell a story. The log scale (as opposed to linear scale) shows the rate of change over time. Each of these lines represents a country's confirmed number of coronavirus cases since their 100th case. Roll over or tap on these lines to see the country they represent or type in a country in the box at the top to examine just its data. Why did we start at case number 100? Because we want to compare countries at the same moment in time in relation to the virus. This chart doesn't just tell us about the progression of a virus; it tells us about a country's response. The line tracking across the top is China. You can see the virus there spiralled out of control as cases rose exponentially. Then the country clawed back control through extreme measures including locking down hundreds of millions of people. South Korea's curve has a similar progression, also starting to flatten. The country arrested its exponential growth primarily through expansive testing and targeted isolation and quarantines. European countries such as Italy and Spain are on that exponential rise. The hope is that their current measures – nationwide lockdowns – will start to flatten those curves. Australia is the green line rising steeply, with only Japan (mauve line) and Singapore under it. What does this chart tell us about Australia's response? It is tricky to see what's happening in the bottom left corner (so rollover or use the search box), but one thing it does show is Australia and Japan were roughly on par until about four days after their 100th cases. After that, Japan's curve shallowed while Australia's continued to rise. Japanese policies of note were the closure of schools and the suspension of large-scale gatherings at the end of February. Before we lose ourselves in all those curves, it is critical to understand the different ways these people caught coronavirus. This chart, above, shows us the underlying reason for COVID-19 infections in NSW. For the best part of March, Australia's health authorities were at pains to point out that while the increasing number of cases looked concerning, the vast majority of them were people who caught it overseas or by a transmission that may have been local but was known and directly linked to that overseas travel. For example: a man travelled to Italy, caught coronavirus there, came home and gave it to his wife. There is no doubt COVID-19 entered Australia in people who caught it overseas. While Australians were fearful of events unfolding in China, Iran and Italy, many people who tested positive after travelling had been to the United States, where the numbers quietly crept up. The restrictions on travel, such as mandatory quarantines and blocking non-citizens and non-residents, were designed to stop this flow. The virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days, which means the full effects of these policies are yet to be seen. A surge in infections on cruise ships meant these numbers continued to climb in late March. Other people in NSW were infected by what's called a known local transmission, which means contact tracers were able to establish the person and place from which the virus was caught. The biggest concern is the increasing number of unknown local transmissions in NSW, also referred to as community transmissions. In these cases, contact tracers have not been able to work out the source of the infection. With these types of cases on the rise, measures such as social distancing and shutdowns are designed to stop this spread. This chart shows the total number of open cases, recoveries and deaths in Australia. Note that one figure of a person here doesn't represent one case: the figures are proportionate to the number of cases. Finally, our virus tracker, below, provides a global view of cases in real-time. It is linked to data from the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and was first shared publicly on January 22. The tracker shows confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries at a glance for all affected countries.

There were 108 new cases reported nationally on Monday, down from 139 on Sunday and 324 on Saturday, but the number of deaths surged by nearly 78 per cent per cent since Thursday. A total of 18 deaths have been reported since Thursday, bringing the national toll to 41. ""The ultimate sign that [the curve was flattening] would be the number of deaths but the good thing in Australia is that total deaths is very low compared to other countries, and because the number is so small it can bounce around a lot,"" professorial research fellow at Victoria University and former World Health Organisation staff member Maximilian de Courten said. He said the latest deaths also reflect case numbers from previous weeks, rather than the present situation. ""The trend in a fall in the number of new cases will translate to fewer deaths in two weeks. Nobody wants to call it too early but [the numbers] look encouraging."" The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on Monday was the lowest in nearly three weeks but experts are divided on whether Australia has flattened the curve.Credit:Rhett Wyman However, Stephen Leeder, a public health professor at the University of Sydney, said case figures could easily start to rise again. ""There's a lot of fluctuation in the figures and it depends a lot on the rate of testing and other factors,"" Professor Leeder said. The number of new cases reported daily has dropped at regular intervals in the past month before surging again. There has been a more sustained fall in the number of new cases in NSW since late-March but Professor de Courten said the growing proportion of cases with an unknown source of infection was concerning. Nearly 400 of the 2640 cases recorded in NSW by Sunday were locally acquired and had no known links to any other confirmed case or cluster, representing 15 per cent of the state's total cases. This proportion has been rising steadily for the past two weeks, from 9 per cent on March 24. In comparison, only 6.6 per cent of all cases in Victoria had an unknown source of infection by Sunday. ""Public health experts have a keen eye on NSW and why that figure is higher, and whether that's [trending up] or coming under control,"" Professor de Courten said. ""For that reason we still hold our breath. If community spread decreases, that means we're becoming more efficient in testing and identifying cases."" Additionally, although the number of new cases in NSW has trended down for about a week, the average number of new tests conducted every day so far this month has fallen to 2700, from nearly 4000 per day last month. The number of total cases as a proportion of total tests conducted in NSW has continued to grow since early-March and was at 2.13 per cent on Sunday. NSW Health did not respond to questions about why the number of new daily tests has fallen. Professor Leeder said the response to the pandemic has ""been handled remarkably well"" by governments and the community in Australia. Australia's infection curve also compares well to other countries such as the US and the UK, which are ""still on a very steep increase"", Professor de Courten said. Australia has 5687 cases 26 days after its 100th case. At the same point in its trajectory, the US had 104,686 cases, China had 50,054 cases and Italy had 41,035 cases.

""Public health experts have a keen eye on NSW and why that figure is higher, and whether that's [trending up] or coming under control,"" Professor de Courten said. ""For that reason we still hold our breath. If community spread decreases, that means we're becoming more efficient in testing and identifying cases."" Additionally, although the number of new cases in NSW has trended down for about a week, the average number of new tests conducted every day so far this month has fallen to 2700, from nearly 4000 per day last month. The number of total cases as a proportion of total tests conducted in NSW has continued to grow since early-March and was at 2.13 per cent on Sunday. NSW Health did not respond to questions about why the number of new daily tests has fallen. Professor Leeder said the response to the pandemic has ""been handled remarkably well"" by governments and the community in Australia. Australia's infection curve also compares well to other countries such as the US and the UK, which are ""still on a very steep increase"", Professor de Courten said. Australia has 5687 cases 26 days after its 100th case. At the same point in its trajectory, the US had 104,686 cases, China had 50,054 cases and Italy had 41,035 cases.

18,/national/how-are-countries-flattening-the-curve-of-coronavirus-20200317-p54b3g.html,How are countries 'flattening the curve' of coronavirus?,"You can't see the virus behind the world's latest pandemic with the naked eye but, plotted on a graph, it looks like one side of a mountain, climbing skyward as cases of COVID-19 soar past half a million worldwide. Eventually, epidemiologists say, that trajectory will start to fall. Immunity in the population will build up against the mystery illness and it will begin to taper off. But in the middle, there will still be that mountain peak – the ""curve"" everyone is talking about. The steeper it is, the more exponential the spread of the virus; the flatter it is, the slower, the less stress on health services and the more lives that will be saved in the months ahead without a vaccine. So how do we flatten the curve? What is herd immunity? And what are countries around the world, including Australia, doing to fix the picture? This graph shows the theory behind ""flattening the curve"". Many doctors including in Australia say the capacity of most healthcare systems fall below the dotted line, making the peak likely to be even more intense and the need for containment, not just a slowdown more critical.Credit:Matthew Absalom-Wong The fight against COVID-19 is about medicine, of course. But it’s also about mathematics (and money). When a new epidemic explodes onto the scene, experts look for two main numbers: how many people each patient will infect and how many people will die from the disease. This helps them plot an arc for the outbreak: how far it will likely spread before a vaccine is rolled out or enough people who have recovered from the illness with virus-fighting antibodies in their system build up ""herd immunity"" against it. Flattening this curve means slowing how fast the virus moves through the community. And it needs us to move. So limiting opportunities for the bug to jump from person to person – by adopting ""social distancing"" measures such as staying 1.5 metres away from others and avoiding public spaces as well as improving hygiene and isolating those infected or exposed – will stretch out the spread of COVID-19 over time, giving doctors, economies (and vaccine-makers) space to breathe. If the curve keeps climbing, we will see a surge of cases needing medical intervention all at once and hospitals will likely run out of life-saving machines such as ventilators, which have been critical in treating patients stricken by more serious cases of the respiratory illness. That would push up the death toll and force impossible triage choices such as the ones that have been facing doctors on the frontlines of the northern Italian outbreak (where an age limit has even been proposed in intensive care wards to free up beds for a growing number of younger patients in their 40s and 50s). It's why some doctors, including in Australia, say simply flattening the curve will not be enough to push it back within the reach of the healthcare system – the virus must be stopped in its tracks through containment in line with what the World Health Organisation is calling for, and even the lockdowns seen in China. So far it's estimated about one in five people infected with the new virus will need medical intervention such as ventilation to recover and about 1 per cent of all patients will die. That's 10 times higher than the mortality rate for seasonal flu but still much less than the first (and now infamous) coronavirus outbreak SARS in 2003. Unfortunately, the new virus is also more infectious. Each person with COVID-19 is likely to infect two or three people – meaning that growth curve can quickly become exponential, according to the Grattan Institute. Every day counts once the pandemic clock starts ticking, warns Dr Michael Ryan, who heads up the WHO's emergency response team. ""Be fast. Have no regrets,"" he told the world on March 13. ""You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly."" During the world's last severe pandemic, the 1918 Spanish flu, the US city of Philadelphia took 14 days to mount a public health response after its first case, even pressing ahead with a big public march. St Louis, meanwhile, cracked down on people's movement and gatherings within just two days of the influenza strain entering its borders. By the end of the crisis, its death toll was less than half of Philadelphia's. Dr Stephen Duckett and his colleagues at Grattan have been tracking the scale and speed of new COVID-19 infections in nations all around the world. Cases might appear in just a trickle at first but, once countries crack the 100 mark, the virus seems to either explode rapidly – such as in China, initially, and then Iran, Italy, the US, and Spain – or slow to a flatter line as has been recorded in places such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Taiwan has brought its caseloads under control by getting ahead of the curve early, ramping up testing, forensically tracing cases back to other people who may have been exposed and making social distancing the norm. Dr Duckett says nations that moved fast to test and track suspected cases and then brought in tough social distancing or containment measures along the lines of the St Louis model have already seen their infection growth fall, even after rapid early spread. (In Singapore, a rise in infections through March prompted the government to step up restrictions there, closing schools and most workplaces until May 4.) In lieu of a vaccine, many countries – and some Australian states – are also closing borders, raising barricades and shutting down much of daily life. By April 4, Australia's infection rate had halved from a daily rate of 25-30 per cent in mid-March to less than 10 per cent as social-distancing measures take effect. Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy says that means they're working, Australia has started to flatten the curve, but now is not the time to take the foot off the brake - and risk the virus getting out of control. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australians should prepare for up to six more months of tough social restrictions. Replay   COVID-19 first emerged in humans in late 2019, at a wet market in the sprawling city of Wuhan, China. The illness was not formally linked to a new strain of coronavirus until early January, when millions of people were already travelling for the country's biggest holiday, Lunar New Year. Infections exploded. But then China's Communist government did something without precedent in modern times – it locked down cities and transport across huge swathes of the country, grounding tens of millions. Factories shut down. Schools and offices closed. Streets emptied. At the time, such a move seemed unthinkable in a Western democracy (and there are still concerns for those stuck under Wuhan's enduring lockdown). But, in the maths, it appears to be working. China was clocking up more than 3000 new cases a day in early February. By mid-March, that number had fallen to less than 30 and on March 19 it recorded none at all for the first time, apart from those imported from other countries. Its government has already claimed ""a great victory"" over the virus and has started to wind back lockdowns even as it prepares for a possible second wave of infections. The WHO says the turnaround is a sign the pandemic can still be contained with ""aggressive measures"", lashing countries for their slow responses thus far. But it's less clear if lockdowns will work for Europe or the Middle East, the next frontiers of the pandemic. In Italy and Iran, early cases appeared to again spread under the radar until a sudden surge hit hospitals (and even Iran's parliament). Both governments were fairly slow to act; in Iran, for reportedly political reasons. In Italy, the government was at first reluctant to impose draconian measures on its densely populated cities. Should it really turn away soccer fans from matches? Or close bars and order people back into their homes from piazzas?  But the blockades in the north, where the outbreak began, failed to stop infections leaking into the rest of the country – and beyond. Now Italy has gone into its own style of lockdown, followed by countries such as Spain, France, German, New Zealand and the UK. People must stay home except when getting ""essentials"" such as groceries (and then they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Singapore introduced such measures in April.     Some experts point out that the two countries that appear to have turned the tide on a rapid outbreak – China and South Korea – have gone further than just lockdowns. Knowing that most infections so far have come from close contact in hospitals or family groups, China takes those who test positive out of their homes into dedicated health centres for isolation. The move is recommended by the WHO and also done in places like Singapore but has raised serious human right rights concerns in China. Horror stories of infection circulating in SARS quarantine still cast a long shadow in China but this time milder cases are kept together in huge pop-up fever clinics, often in converted stadiums and gymnasiums, and those still being tested reportedly kept away from confirmed cases. Both China and South Korea, including success stories such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have also been aggressively hunting for cases – temperatures are taken before entering any building. If you have a fever, you must roll up to a specialised clinic or ""drive-through"" for testing. These parts of the world have been hit hard by dangerous coronavirus outbreaks of the past, including SARS, Dr Duckett notes, and so their people were already primed for the health checks to come. When word came from China that another coronavirus had jumped from animals to humans, countries such as Singapore and Taiwan acted quickly. Social distancing has  played out without need for stricter lockdowns or domestic travel bans. While Hong Kong faced criticism for not closing its borders to mainland China fast enough, months of anti-Beijing protests meant schools were already teaching online and many people working from home. South Korea, meanwhile, saw the virus erupt within a religious sect and quickly deployed particularly exhaustive detective work to track close contacts of known cases – famously using CCTV to trace people back to a specific bus or taxi. The island nation of Singapore looked in danger of being overrun in February when it was recording the second-highest volume of cases outside China. It flattened its curve through quick detection and diagnosis as well as strictly enforced home quarantines (featuring spot checks and twice-daily location monitoring with serious penalties applying for a breach.) As cases crept up again in March, the government hit the brakes. ""We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections,"" said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The use of technology has been perceived as both useful and potentially troubling. Countries such as China, Iran and Israel are deploying their notoriously invasive surveillance networks, including tracking phones, to keep tabs on people under isolation and close in on suspected cases. Australia also has powers to order people into quarantine and states have mobilised police forces and even the Australian army to help enforce such orders. But other experts including Adjunct Professor at UNSW Bill Bowtell, who helped design Australia's response to the AIDS crisis, have warned punitive measures will only keep people away from testing clinics. Lining up for a ""fever clinic"" at Sir Charles Gairdner hospital in Perth.Credit:Nine WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has blasted governments around the world for giving up on widespread testing and contact tracing, ""the backbone"" of any response, even as they ramp up social distancing measures. ""You cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,"" he said on March 16. ""Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in contact with. And test those people too."" A lab test for samples of the virus was created quickly. But faster blood tests are still only widely available in China, where diagnosis has been industrialised. At a fever clinic, you will be met by a healthcare worker in full protective gear, testing white blood cell counts and deploying portable scanners to check for the tell-tale ""ground glass"" inflammation of COVID-19 in the lungs. Even there, a recent study found two-thirds of reported cases could be traced back to undiagnosed patients – suggesting the virus could be spreading under the radar even from people with fewer symptoms who shed less virus. In the US, low testing rates and diagnosis delays from a botched roll-out of initial tests have been blamed for an explosion of cases across Washington, New York and California – by April, the United States had the most infections of any nation and more than 7000 deaths. Extending the timeline for social distancing measures, President Donald Trump said if the US could hold down the death count to 100,000 it would show the country had done a ""very good job"". Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries around the world (more than 178,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still very strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. In recent days, it has moved to both ramp up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expand that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also been flagged in areas identified as at risk of community transmission. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the Waverley local government area, which had the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says faster tests that can be done at home are also due to arrive in Australia but still needed to go through quality, safety and efficacy checks by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. At times, health authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, about 200 of whom later tested positive. The term ""herd immunity"" also went viral amid speculation that Britain's government was lagging behind other nations in imposing social distancing measures as part of a bold plan to allow the virus to sweep through the population, (and so build up their immunity against it).  In the modern era, community resistance to a virus is commonly achieved through a vaccine. Experts, including in Australia, have warned that stalling protections against COVID-19 for the sake of encouraging natural resistance among ""the herd"" could be ""catastrophic"", costing lives without much slowdown. It's also unclear just how long people will stay immune to the virus once they've caught it and if it will burn out entirely as more people recover and the seasons change or if it will linger or even mutate and return into the population at a later stage. The United Kingdom had planned to seal off its most vulnerable, such as the old and unwell, and delay other protections. But following stern advice from experts, its since brought forward a full-scale shutdown, closing schools and telling people to stay home from work. Now the Netherlands has revealed it will embrace a COVID-19 strategy of its own based on herd immunity, saying mass lockdowns are not feasible. Part of the challenge facing world leaders is balancing the threat of the virus against the huge disruption of containment, which experts warn could bring its own health costs. New analysis of virus-fighting strategies by the Imperial College London found more targeted measures such as isolating those exposed to the virus or at risk of serious complications could reduce peak demand on hospitals by about two thirds. But this would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone. Instead researchers recommended a wider, though more difficult ""suppression"", where people across the community stay home more often and distance themselves from each other until a vaccine can be rolled out. The problem, as Professor Murphy in Australia has also stressed, is keeping it up over the months ahead without burnout. ""You can't just shut things down for two weeks and that's it.

19,/national/how-are-countries-flattening-the-curve-of-coronavirus-20200317-p54b3g.html,How are countries 'flattening the curve' of coronavirus?,"You can't see the virus behind the world's latest pandemic with the naked eye but, plotted on a graph, it looks like one side of a mountain, climbing skyward as cases of COVID-19 soar past half a million worldwide. Eventually, epidemiologists say, that trajectory will start to fall. Immunity in the population will build up against the mystery illness and it will begin to taper off. But in the middle, there will still be that mountain peak – the ""curve"" everyone is talking about. The steeper it is, the more exponential the spread of the virus; the flatter it is, the slower, the less stress on health services and the more lives that will be saved in the months ahead without a vaccine. So how do we flatten the curve? What is herd immunity? And what are countries around the world, including Australia, doing to fix the picture? This graph shows the theory behind ""flattening the curve"". Many doctors including in Australia say the capacity of most healthcare systems fall below the dotted line, making the peak likely to be even more intense and the need for containment, not just a slowdown more critical.Credit:Matthew Absalom-Wong The fight against COVID-19 is about medicine, of course. But it’s also about mathematics (and money). When a new epidemic explodes onto the scene, experts look for two main numbers: how many people each patient will infect and how many people will die from the disease. This helps them plot an arc for the outbreak: how far it will likely spread before a vaccine is rolled out or enough people who have recovered from the illness with virus-fighting antibodies in their system build up ""herd immunity"" against it. Flattening this curve means slowing how fast the virus moves through the community. And it needs us to move. So limiting opportunities for the bug to jump from person to person – by adopting ""social distancing"" measures such as staying 1.5 metres away from others and avoiding public spaces as well as improving hygiene and isolating those infected or exposed – will stretch out the spread of COVID-19 over time, giving doctors, economies (and vaccine-makers) space to breathe. If the curve keeps climbing, we will see a surge of cases needing medical intervention all at once and hospitals will likely run out of life-saving machines such as ventilators, which have been critical in treating patients stricken by more serious cases of the respiratory illness. That would push up the death toll and force impossible triage choices such as the ones that have been facing doctors on the frontlines of the northern Italian outbreak (where an age limit has even been proposed in intensive care wards to free up beds for a growing number of younger patients in their 40s and 50s). It's why some doctors, including in Australia, say simply flattening the curve will not be enough to push it back within the reach of the healthcare system – the virus must be stopped in its tracks through containment in line with what the World Health Organisation is calling for, and even the lockdowns seen in China. So far it's estimated about one in five people infected with the new virus will need medical intervention such as ventilation to recover and about 1 per cent of all patients will die. That's 10 times higher than the mortality rate for seasonal flu but still much less than the first (and now infamous) coronavirus outbreak SARS in 2003. Unfortunately, the new virus is also more infectious. Each person with COVID-19 is likely to infect two or three people – meaning that growth curve can quickly become exponential, according to the Grattan Institute. Every day counts once the pandemic clock starts ticking, warns Dr Michael Ryan, who heads up the WHO's emergency response team. ""Be fast. Have no regrets,"" he told the world on March 13. ""You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly."" During the world's last severe pandemic, the 1918 Spanish flu, the US city of Philadelphia took 14 days to mount a public health response after its first case, even pressing ahead with a big public march. St Louis, meanwhile, cracked down on people's movement and gatherings within just two days of the influenza strain entering its borders. By the end of the crisis, its death toll was less than half of Philadelphia's. Dr Stephen Duckett and his colleagues at Grattan have been tracking the scale and speed of new COVID-19 infections in nations all around the world. Cases might appear in just a trickle at first but, once countries crack the 100 mark, the virus seems to either explode rapidly – such as in China, initially, and then Iran, Italy, the US, and Spain – or slow to a flatter line as has been recorded in places such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Taiwan has brought its caseloads under control by getting ahead of the curve early, ramping up testing, forensically tracing cases back to other people who may have been exposed and making social distancing the norm. Dr Duckett says nations that moved fast to test and track suspected cases and then brought in tough social distancing or containment measures along the lines of the St Louis model have already seen their infection growth fall, even after rapid early spread. (In Singapore, a rise in infections through March prompted the government to step up restrictions there, closing schools and most workplaces until May 4.) In lieu of a vaccine, many countries – and some Australian states – are also closing borders, raising barricades and shutting down much of daily life. By April 4, Australia's infection rate had halved from a daily rate of 25-30 per cent in mid-March to less than 10 per cent as social-distancing measures take effect. Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy says that means they're working, Australia has started to flatten the curve, but now is not the time to take the foot off the brake - and risk the virus getting out of control. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australians should prepare for up to six more months of tough social restrictions. Replay   COVID-19 first emerged in humans in late 2019, at a wet market in the sprawling city of Wuhan, China. The illness was not formally linked to a new strain of coronavirus until early January, when millions of people were already travelling for the country's biggest holiday, Lunar New Year. Infections exploded. But then China's Communist government did something without precedent in modern times – it locked down cities and transport across huge swathes of the country, grounding tens of millions. Factories shut down. Schools and offices closed. Streets emptied. At the time, such a move seemed unthinkable in a Western democracy (and there are still concerns for those stuck under Wuhan's enduring lockdown). But, in the maths, it appears to be working. China was clocking up more than 3000 new cases a day in early February. By mid-March, that number had fallen to less than 30 and on March 19 it recorded none at all for the first time, apart from those imported from other countries. Its government has already claimed ""a great victory"" over the virus and has started to wind back lockdowns even as it prepares for a possible second wave of infections. The WHO says the turnaround is a sign the pandemic can still be contained with ""aggressive measures"", lashing countries for their slow responses thus far. But it's less clear if lockdowns will work for Europe or the Middle East, the next frontiers of the pandemic. In Italy and Iran, early cases appeared to again spread under the radar until a sudden surge hit hospitals (and even Iran's parliament). Both governments were fairly slow to act; in Iran, for reportedly political reasons. In Italy, the government was at first reluctant to impose draconian measures on its densely populated cities. Should it really turn away soccer fans from matches? Or close bars and order people back into their homes from piazzas?  But the blockades in the north, where the outbreak began, failed to stop infections leaking into the rest of the country – and beyond. Now Italy has gone into its own style of lockdown, followed by countries such as Spain, France, German, New Zealand and the UK. People must stay home except when getting ""essentials"" such as groceries (and then they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Singapore introduced such measures in April.     Some experts point out that the two countries that appear to have turned the tide on a rapid outbreak – China and South Korea – have gone further than just lockdowns. Knowing that most infections so far have come from close contact in hospitals or family groups, China takes those who test positive out of their homes into dedicated health centres for isolation. The move is recommended by the WHO and also done in places like Singapore but has raised serious human right rights concerns in China. Horror stories of infection circulating in SARS quarantine still cast a long shadow in China but this time milder cases are kept together in huge pop-up fever clinics, often in converted stadiums and gymnasiums, and those still being tested reportedly kept away from confirmed cases. Both China and South Korea, including success stories such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have also been aggressively hunting for cases – temperatures are taken before entering any building. If you have a fever, you must roll up to a specialised clinic or ""drive-through"" for testing. These parts of the world have been hit hard by dangerous coronavirus outbreaks of the past, including SARS, Dr Duckett notes, and so their people were already primed for the health checks to come. When word came from China that another coronavirus had jumped from animals to humans, countries such as Singapore and Taiwan acted quickly. Social distancing has  played out without need for stricter lockdowns or domestic travel bans. While Hong Kong faced criticism for not closing its borders to mainland China fast enough, months of anti-Beijing protests meant schools were already teaching online and many people working from home. South Korea, meanwhile, saw the virus erupt within a religious sect and quickly deployed particularly exhaustive detective work to track close contacts of known cases – famously using CCTV to trace people back to a specific bus or taxi. The island nation of Singapore looked in danger of being overrun in February when it was recording the second-highest volume of cases outside China. It flattened its curve through quick detection and diagnosis as well as strictly enforced home quarantines (featuring spot checks and twice-daily location monitoring with serious penalties applying for a breach.) As cases crept up again in March, the government hit the brakes. ""We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections,"" said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The use of technology has been perceived as both useful and potentially troubling. Countries such as China, Iran and Israel are deploying their notoriously invasive surveillance networks, including tracking phones, to keep tabs on people under isolation and close in on suspected cases. Australia also has powers to order people into quarantine and states have mobilised police forces and even the Australian army to help enforce such orders. But other experts including Adjunct Professor at UNSW Bill Bowtell, who helped design Australia's response to the AIDS crisis, have warned punitive measures will only keep people away from testing clinics. Lining up for a ""fever clinic"" at Sir Charles Gairdner hospital in Perth.Credit:Nine WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has blasted governments around the world for giving up on widespread testing and contact tracing, ""the backbone"" of any response, even as they ramp up social distancing measures. ""You cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected,"" he said on March 16. ""Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in contact with. And test those people too."" A lab test for samples of the virus was created quickly. But faster blood tests are still only widely available in China, where diagnosis has been industrialised. At a fever clinic, you will be met by a healthcare worker in full protective gear, testing white blood cell counts and deploying portable scanners to check for the tell-tale ""ground glass"" inflammation of COVID-19 in the lungs. Even there, a recent study found two-thirds of reported cases could be traced back to undiagnosed patients – suggesting the virus could be spreading under the radar even from people with fewer symptoms who shed less virus. In the US, low testing rates and diagnosis delays from a botched roll-out of initial tests have been blamed for an explosion of cases across Washington, New York and California – by April, the United States had the most infections of any nation and more than 7000 deaths. Extending the timeline for social distancing measures, President Donald Trump said if the US could hold down the death count to 100,000 it would show the country had done a ""very good job"". Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries around the world (more than 178,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still very strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. In recent days, it has moved to both ramp up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expand that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also been flagged in areas identified as at risk of community transmission. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the Waverley local government area, which had the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says faster tests that can be done at home are also due to arrive in Australia but still needed to go through quality, safety and efficacy checks by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. At times, health authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, about 200 of whom later tested positive. The term ""herd immunity"" also went viral amid speculation that Britain's government was lagging behind other nations in imposing social distancing measures as part of a bold plan to allow the virus to sweep through the population, (and so build up their immunity against it).  In the modern era, community resistance to a virus is commonly achieved through a vaccine. Experts, including in Australia, have warned that stalling protections against COVID-19 for the sake of encouraging natural resistance among ""the herd"" could be ""catastrophic"", costing lives without much slowdown. It's also unclear just how long people will stay immune to the virus once they've caught it and if it will burn out entirely as more people recover and the seasons change or if it will linger or even mutate and return into the population at a later stage. The United Kingdom had planned to seal off its most vulnerable, such as the old and unwell, and delay other protections. But following stern advice from experts, its since brought forward a full-scale shutdown, closing schools and telling people to stay home from work. Now the Netherlands has revealed it will embrace a COVID-19 strategy of its own based on herd immunity, saying mass lockdowns are not feasible. Part of the challenge facing world leaders is balancing the threat of the virus against the huge disruption of containment, which experts warn could bring its own health costs. New analysis of virus-fighting strategies by the Imperial College London found more targeted measures such as isolating those exposed to the virus or at risk of serious complications could reduce peak demand on hospitals by about two thirds. But this would still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone. Instead researchers recommended a wider, though more difficult ""suppression"", where people across the community stay home more often and distance themselves from each other until a vaccine can be rolled out. The problem, as Professor Murphy in Australia has also stressed, is keeping it up over the months ahead without burnout. ""You can't just shut things down for two weeks and that's it. It has to keep going."" Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

Many people are already wearing face masks.Credit:Paul Rovere The WHO currently recommends only wearing a mask if you are ill, caring for the sick or if you are a front-line healthcare worker. However, at a March 30 briefing, WHO officials said that the agency did not criticise countries that advised people to wear masks. The Australian government said people who are well do not need to wear surgical masks, advising “there is little evidence supporting the widespread use of surgical masks in healthy people to prevent transmission in public”. UNSW Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an adviser to the WHO on COVID-19 preparedness, confirmed a report in The Guardian that said the organisation was reviewing all evidence. “A panel of experts are spending many hours looking at the evidence,” Professor McLaws said. The White House is also considering whether to recommend the broad use of masks in the United States, according to the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci. President Donald Trump said on March 30: “We are not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear.” The federal Health Department and Health Minister Greg Hunt’s office did not respond before deadline to whether Australia would also review its guidelines. But the Australian Medical Association said: “Ultimately it seems a bit of a pointless exercise calling for the whole population to wear masks, when we can’t even get enough for our doctors.” Professor McLaws said it would be up to individual countries to decide how they responded to any change in WHO’s advice, based on local conditions, including the stage of the epidemic, population density and the availability of masks. “We would be foolhardy not to acknowledge Singapore’s feats in getting their numbers contained and they have used masks, but they have a very different population density to cases, the major transmission risk was from within the community and they have a strong culture of cooperation given their experience with SARS in 2003.” She also said it was crucial masks were used in the correct way, so that people did not infect themselves when taking them off and that there was sufficient supply. COVID-19 spreads from person to person through droplets that an infected person sneezes or coughs out. Surgical face masks can help to catch some of these droplets. A study of the transmission of SARS - also a coronavirus - in Beijing in 2003 found “always wearing a mask when going out was associated with a 70 per cent reduction in risk compared with never wearing a mask”. But Professor Bruce Thompson, Dean of Health Sciences at Swinburne University, said if people practise social distancing - standing at least one-and-a-half metres apart - “it’s unlikely you are going to get a bug”. He said while social distancing rules were being broadly adhered to in Australia, this could be more difficult in more densely populated Asian cities, which might need to think of other ways of stopping the airborne transmission of the virus. “If you are practising social distancing you shouldn’t need to use them,” Professor Thompson said. “They need to be prioritised for health workers and hospitals - people actually on the frontline.” Doctors and nurses in Australia have raised concerns about a shortage of surgical face masks, with a survey of 1056 front-line doctors finding more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to personal protective equipment. Professor Thompson also said face masks needed to be taken off in the correct way so the virus wasn’t spread on fingers, and hands needed to be carefully washed. “Face masks also have their own problems, they have to be properly handled to stop you re-infecting yourself or someone else.” He said at this point in time he saw no need for Australia to change its guidelines governing their use.
