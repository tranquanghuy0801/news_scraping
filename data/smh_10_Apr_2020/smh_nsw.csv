The national death toll now stands at 53. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard reminded the public that NSW Police from Friday are able to fine people who spit or cough on health workers or police officers. NSW Minister for Health Brad Hazzard speaks to the media during a press conference in Sydney, Friday, April 10, 2020. Credit:Bianca De Marchi One of NSW’s most critically ill coronavirus patients is on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenator), a machine which takes over a patient's lung or heart function, reoxygenating their blood and removing carbon dioxide externally. ""ECMO, of course, is a higher level of need for the patient ... making sure your organs are being oxygenated,"" Mr Hazzard said. Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in ICU in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state had seen a ""very modest"" increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was ""fantastic"" the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday. He said each of the state's 22 deaths had taken an emotional toll on families, as well as the doctors and nurses who had been treating them. ""I talk to doctors and nurses who were putting themselves at risk, but they were still absolutely moved by the death of that person,"" he said. ""It is quite emotional for these doctors and nurses who are on the frontline."" NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the 69-year-old man who died at John Hunter Hospital acquired the disease locally, likely during a recent interstate trip. ""Any death is a tragic one,"" she said, adding locally acquired cases remained a ""major concern"" for NSW Health. From Friday, NSW Police are able to issue a $5000 on-the-spot fine for spitting or coughing on health workers or police officers. ""I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5000 fine,"" Mr Hazzard said. He said the fine was unprecedented, but ""it reflects the community disgust"". ""It is absolutely disgusting to think that anybody would think it's OK to cough or spit on a police officer or a health worker at any time, let alone in the world's worst virus crisis for a hundred years,"" Mr Hazzard said. ""So, $5000, you should be very lucky, you're getting off lightly."" In the last 24 hours, police have handed out almost 50 fines of $1000 for breaching social isolation restrictions. NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said any breaches of the rules will not be tolerated. ""These people need to be sent a very clear message that it won't be tolerated, it won't be tolerated by the police or the community,"" he said. He thanked people staying at home this Easter but added police would be out in force this long weekend, keeping their eyes peeled for people travelling away from home. ""Right across country NSW, and, indeed, in and around the urban area here, police have been vigilant around people towing caravans, people with trailers and quad bikes and camping gear, people with surfboards,"" he said. Mr Worboys said police near border towns were also on the lookout for vehicles with Queensland and Victorian licence plates. ""If you don’t have an excuse to travel you will be issued with a $1000 fine,"" he said.

The opt-in draft award will see council workers, who cannot be suitably redeployed while services are shut during the COVID-19 crisis, paid up to four weeks' special leave, then more than $850 a week for up to three months in an arrangement one administrator said would result in other vital council services being slashed. Council staff do not qualify for the federal government's JobKeeper package.Credit:Glen McCurtayne Local Government NSW president Linda Scott said the lack of federal support meant her organisation had ""worked hard with local government unions to develop a way forward, focusing on keeping as many essential services running for our communities as we can."" ""By blocking the local government workforce access to the JobKeeper allowance, the Prime Minister has actively disadvantaged communities and the support local governments can provide to them,"" Cr Scott said. Meanwhile, she praised the NSW government's $82 million injection into local government childcare services, some of which had announced their closure because the federal government's free childcare package made their operations unviable without council workers' inclusion in the JobKeeper subsidy. United Services Union NSW general secretary Graeme Kelly OAM declined to comment on the draft award until it was finalised. Despite an outcry from the local government sector, the $130 billion package passed federal Parliament on Wednesday night without the inclusion of councils, who Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously said state governments are responsible for. But on the same day NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said state funding would ensure the continued operation of 260 council-run childcare centres, the federal Department of Education extended its childcare funding to council-run services in the form of an ""exceptional circumstance"" supplement. The department states on its website the payment is available for providers who need a ""top up"" on the previously announced relief package they are already getting. ""If a provider/service is run by local government, or otherwise not eligible for JobKeeper Payment, it may be eligible for supplementary payment,"" the document states. While welcoming both state and federal initiatives, Cr Scott said without further economic stimulus from the NSW government, many councils would cease to operate over the coming months. ""Blacktown City Council, in Sydney’s west, is already losing $1.7 million per week,"" she said. One general manager of a Sydney council, who spoke to the Herald under the condition of anonymity, said councils were now resorting to raiding their cash reserves to sign on to the splinter award, which if passed, is due to expire next April. ""General managers across the state are reducing their capital works program for next year to afford this splinter award, that means roads, parks and new buildings, drainage, footpaths,"" the administrator said.

Local Government Minister Shelley Hancock said the NSW government was continuing to assess the economic impact of COVID-19 on councils, who she was committed to supporting.

5,/national/nsw/i-never-thought-i-d-say-it-but-i-miss-going-to-school-20200409-p54ik5.html,"'I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school'","By Natassia Chrysanthos Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon Almost 500 NSW students wrote to the Herald this week about their experiences of home learning while they bunker down and stay away from school as part of the national effort to stall the spread of coronavirus. Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak. It feels as though our history textbooks have come to life, doesn’t it?Vania Zakerfathi, 14, Asquith Lola Christopoulos, 11, from Drummoyne.Credit:Lola Christopoulos 2020 began with blackened skies and a constant dangerous smoky haze as we dealt with the threat of the massive bushfires surrounding us in the Snowy Mountains. However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I’ve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don’t want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‘Mum’ again but this time I was actually right! It’s been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all – in a way that a son caught smoking his father’s cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the “can robots replace teachers one day?” debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun – almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: “Isn't this exciting!” I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I’ve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we’d have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me – well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can’t explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren’t for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself … Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It’s the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it’s like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn’t have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we’ve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon – and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I’m still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can’t help but be sad that we’re missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I’ve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I’m constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn’t fill me with motivation. I’m not a super eager student and I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can’t see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can’t pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can’t hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak. It feels as though our history textbooks have come to life, doesn’t it?Vania Zakerfathi, 14, Asquith Lola Christopoulos, 11, from Drummoyne.Credit:Lola Christopoulos 2020 began with blackened skies and a constant dangerous smoky haze as we dealt with the threat of the massive bushfires surrounding us in the Snowy Mountains. However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I’ve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don’t want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‘Mum’ again but this time I was actually right! It’s been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all – in a way that a son caught smoking his father’s cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the “can robots replace teachers one day?” debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun – almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: “Isn't this exciting!” I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I’ve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we’d have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me – well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can’t explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren’t for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself … Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It’s the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it’s like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn’t have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we’ve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon – and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I’m still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can’t help but be sad that we’re missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I’ve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I’m constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn’t fill me with motivation. I’m not a super eager student and I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home.

7,/national/nsw/pell-s-accuser-took-the-verdict-with-grace-and-integrity-20200408-p54ibv.html,Pell's accuser took the verdict with grace and integrity,"Illustration: Cathy WilcoxCredit:  If you, like me, are a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and found your visceral memories and emotional pain resurfacing this week, I urge you to read Witness J’s full statement online (""Pell's accuser accepts High Court verdict"", April 9). This faceless but not invisible man was able to comfort and reassure me with his articulate words, written with grace and integrity. I also want to acknowledge the simple but powerful words from Daniel Andrews; ""I see you, I hear you, I believe you."" They are exactly what the inner child of an adult survivor wants to hear from those in authority. Finally to witness J:  you have inspired me. Thank you and take care. Ruth Spence, Newcastle It is worrying to read how the High Court has changed its role from judging legal errors to judging the findings of juries (""Consider 12 victims of the Pell verdict"", April 9). Studying written evidence of court cases and video screening of sections of these cannot replace all that is seen and heard by juries. As Malcolm Knox points out, if this continues juries could become unnecessary and irrelevant. We too often distrust political decisions. We surely do not want to start distrusting legal decisions as well. Gillian Baldwin, Windradyne Our jury system is dogged by the fact that an accused's fate lies in the hands of 12 people of generally average intelligence placed under great pressure to reach a unanimous decision based on an onerous and difficult-to-understand burden of proof - ""beyond reasonable doubt"". Since case law is replete with jurists tweaking this definition, it's no surprise a jury, made up of persons with no legal training, gets it wrong sometimes and, in its deliberations, unconsciously substitutes the less onerous civil burden of proof ""on the balance of probabilities"". You can't always blame a jury for reaching a perverse verdict, but it is a strong reason for either abolishing the system or using it more judiciously. Fred Jansohn, Rose Bay By contradicting the verdict of the jury and overturning their unanimous conclusion, not on matters of law but on matters of fact, the High Court is surely overturning the purpose and functions of the jury system, which has served us well for 800 years. To leave such decisions to the bench is surely going to result in more, not fewer, miscarriages of justice. The jury system has evolved over the years to prevent exactly that. It’s not perfect, and the removal of the adversarial system would probably improve it, but it has provided fairer results than trial by judges. Ron Pretty, Farmborough Heights The last time I was called up for jury duty I mounted this argument: what is the point of a jury's decision if it can be overturned by the Court of Appeal or another court? Patricia Farrar, Concord Why can George Pell drive from Melbourne to Sydney when I am prevented from driving from Sydney to the Northern Rivers to visit my family? One rule for the powerful, another for those without influence. Elizabeth Elenius, Pyrmont The government’s $130 billion wage subsidy has passed through the Parliament (''Wage subsidies made law but PM warns of long road ahead'', April 9). I am one of the one million workers who have been left behind by the scheme. I am a full-time university student, employed in three casual jobs and live with my grandparents, unsupported by my parents. Two weeks ago, I lost my primary casual job as a receptionist where I was working 30 hours a week. I began working there nine months ago, making me ineligible for the government's JobKeeper payments despite me still being employed in my other casual job at McDonald's for more than six years. I went to Centrelink, who decided I'm ineligible for JobSeeker payments due to my full-time studies so I must apply for Youth Allowance. I am 21 and seven months but Youth Allowance classifies me as a dependent until the age of 22. How can the government have failed to consider these circumstances and similar situations many young people find themselves in? Tahlia Scheffer, Mount Riverview The federal government and the states are trying a balancing act between minimising financial hardship and sending the country broke. The theory behind what they are doing is admirable. However, I hope there will be a concrete deadline when these benefits will be stopped, because there are several anomalies which may make a significant percentage of those out of work not want to go back. If you were unemployed or on other benefits well before March 1, you were already getting a handout from the government. It is ludicrous that they will now get even more money. Also, the average casual worker earns about $460 per week. How on earth did they come up with a $750? It is all very well to give people a helping hand, but the next generation will still be paying off this debt. Jeff Cook, West Pennant Hills To spend $130 billion of other people's money to save the country is not ""brave"". Bravery will come when it's time to pay the money back. Will future governments stare down the vested interests, or will it be the easy neo-liberal way of taking money from the poor, public education, health and welfare? Brenton McGeachie, Queanbeyan West In gradually flattening the curve, we have proof now that good government relies on rigorous expert advice, and everyone working together to solve problems (""Retailers encouraged to start reopening stores"", April 9). Next, we need the same applied to our scarily warming planet, and unjust, unaffordable housing. Sue Young, Bensville An early re-start of the NRL season would lead to more deaths of our loved ones (''Game on for rugby league?'', April 9). Early resumption of televised games would poison community resolve for social distancing and send the clear message that self-isolation is not as important as corporate sport finances. It seems that there are certain privileged groups within our community that do not have to abide by the same rules as the rest of us. It is time that the NRL set aside selfish self-interest for players and executives of the game and put community welfare first. The ethically questionable practice of the NRL and sponsoring networks of continuing to maintain play in packed stadiums right up until it was banned by government decree, and now attempting to restart at the earliest opportunity demonstrates a cavalier disregard for the vulnerable. Keith Sloan, East Ballina No, John Barilaro, the NRL is not ''the tonic we need to get through this virus''. That comes from the continued discipline of self-isolation and hygiene measures and certainly not from teams of boofy footballers manhandling each other. NRL games continued, with the blessing of the Prime Minister, for too long at the onset of this pandemic and there is no logical reason for their resumption. John Byrne, Randwick ''The tonic the state and nation needs to get through the virus''? That's medically unfounded. Alexander Elliott, Bilgola Plateau Can someone please get it into the stubborn, irresponsible heads of the NRL, and seemingly some in government too, that this pandemic will not be over by May 21 nor June 21, nor any date until there are no new cases for at least a month, ideally not until there is a vaccine? As they did by starting the season in the first place, by even considering a resumption the NRL are treating the virus, their players and the public with arrogant contempt. Paul Cunningham, Frenchs Forest If the NRL competition resumes next month, will NSW Police be on hand to enforce the regulations regarding restricted gatherings and social distancing? Rod Allan, Kelso Only one word springs to mind: madness. No one can guarantee that this is a risk-free exercise. Graham Russell, Clovelly Border Force was set up by the Coalition to keep our borders safe. The officers were given military uniforms and its operations were kept secret. Most voters realised that the setting up of Border Force was a political exercise, designed to win votes for the Coalition because it was being ''tough'' on boat people (''Border Force allowed Ruby Princess back into Sydney'', April 9). Now it seems to be the case that Border Force, so good at keeping hapless refugees out, has failed Australians when it has been put to a real test. Geoff Black, Caves Beach Border Farce. Philip Bell, Bronte Illustration: Matt GoldingCredit:  It is alarming that the category in the data table for spending during the past week shows a 67 per cent increase in online gambling and a 33 per cent in tobacco and alcohol purchases (“Stimulus spending attests spending slump”, April 9). It is to be hoped that there will be sufficient support for the families who are adversely affected by these increases as we continue to be confined to our homes for all but essential purposes. Sandra Burke, North Sydney  The damage gambling does to society’s fabric is well known and I am always disturbed when I see the adverts on  TV for gambling websites. Given the tough line Australian governments have taken to protect the fabric of Australian society during this COVID-19 crisis, and notwithstanding said governments’ addiction to the revenue streams from this accursed activity, might now not be a great time to ban those adverts on TV? With TAB, clubs and pubs shut during this crisis, this would also be an ideal time to rein in our seeming national addiction to this detestable and disabling activity. Brian King, Wyee Point With Virgin Australia asking for a government ""bridging"" loan of $1.4 billion to be converted to ownership if they cannot repay it, they are in essence agreeing to a possible part-nationalisation (''Labor backs Virgin's bid for lifeline'', April 9). Perhaps the government should look at nationalising both Qantas and Virgin Australia, amalgamating them into a new publicly owned airline and letting the hoi polloi enjoy some of the future possible profits instead of always financing the losses. Then again, pigs might fly. Stewart Smith, Tea Gardens  No one, regardless of political persuasion, would wish to see Prime Minister Johnson suffering from the virus and I genuinely wish him a speedy recovery (Letters, April 9). As a get-well greeting, I have just posted him a card with a comb inside and instructions on how to use it. Terry Charleston, Cootamundra Here's a question from a golf tragic: why is it, when every health authority is imploring people daily to stay at home, golf clubs across the state are allowed to remain open, thus ensuring that people will leave home, travel and gather together (''Here are the COVID-19 rules - stop looking for loopholes'', April 9)? Peter Thomas, Rose Bay I have bad news and good news for Tony Recsei (Letters, April 9). The bad: the high-density bus left the stop long ago and apartment dwellers in convenient locations are loving it. The good: The vast majority of Sydney is still low density. John Christie, Oatley What a pity that the most widely circulated news articles about the amazingly talented country-folk singer songwriter John Prine was of his obituary dying of the coronavirus (''Virus claims folk legend John Prine'', April 9). This was an artist whose songs were mini-novellas about people or situations many of us have experienced or could relate to; that’s why artists such as Dylan and Springsteen praised his genius for songwriting. Far too many singers with little ability have become household names while people such as Prine are known only on the fringes of music. Fortunately it’s not too late to still listen to his songs. He will be missed. Con Vaitsas, Ashbury I agree with your correspondents on the need to observe the practice of keeping left (Letters, April 9). However, in these advancing years, doing so on stairways and escalators poses the problem of contamination of my ""eating hand"" from touching handrails and other steadying objects. Max Petrie, Palm Beach To my neighbours who may feel slighted by my failure to greet them by name as I pass you in the street while shopping, I apologise and offer the following plea in mitigation: in the days BC (before COVID-19) it was often a challenge to recognise those of you wearing a hat and sunglasses. But in the days AD (after disease) recognition has become almost impossible when you’re wearing a mask as well.

8,/national/nsw/pell-s-accuser-took-the-verdict-with-grace-and-integrity-20200408-p54ibv.html,Pell's accuser took the verdict with grace and integrity,"Illustration: Cathy WilcoxCredit:  If you, like me, are a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and found your visceral memories and emotional pain resurfacing this week, I urge you to read Witness J’s full statement online (""Pell's accuser accepts High Court verdict"", April 9). This faceless but not invisible man was able to comfort and reassure me with his articulate words, written with grace and integrity. I also want to acknowledge the simple but powerful words from Daniel Andrews; ""I see you, I hear you, I believe you."" They are exactly what the inner child of an adult survivor wants to hear from those in authority. Finally to witness J:  you have inspired me. Thank you and take care. Ruth Spence, Newcastle It is worrying to read how the High Court has changed its role from judging legal errors to judging the findings of juries (""Consider 12 victims of the Pell verdict"", April 9). Studying written evidence of court cases and video screening of sections of these cannot replace all that is seen and heard by juries. As Malcolm Knox points out, if this continues juries could become unnecessary and irrelevant. We too often distrust political decisions. We surely do not want to start distrusting legal decisions as well. Gillian Baldwin, Windradyne Our jury system is dogged by the fact that an accused's fate lies in the hands of 12 people of generally average intelligence placed under great pressure to reach a unanimous decision based on an onerous and difficult-to-understand burden of proof - ""beyond reasonable doubt"". Since case law is replete with jurists tweaking this definition, it's no surprise a jury, made up of persons with no legal training, gets it wrong sometimes and, in its deliberations, unconsciously substitutes the less onerous civil burden of proof ""on the balance of probabilities"". You can't always blame a jury for reaching a perverse verdict, but it is a strong reason for either abolishing the system or using it more judiciously. Fred Jansohn, Rose Bay By contradicting the verdict of the jury and overturning their unanimous conclusion, not on matters of law but on matters of fact, the High Court is surely overturning the purpose and functions of the jury system, which has served us well for 800 years. To leave such decisions to the bench is surely going to result in more, not fewer, miscarriages of justice. The jury system has evolved over the years to prevent exactly that. It’s not perfect, and the removal of the adversarial system would probably improve it, but it has provided fairer results than trial by judges. Ron Pretty, Farmborough Heights The last time I was called up for jury duty I mounted this argument: what is the point of a jury's decision if it can be overturned by the Court of Appeal or another court? Patricia Farrar, Concord Why can George Pell drive from Melbourne to Sydney when I am prevented from driving from Sydney to the Northern Rivers to visit my family? One rule for the powerful, another for those without influence. Elizabeth Elenius, Pyrmont The government’s $130 billion wage subsidy has passed through the Parliament (''Wage subsidies made law but PM warns of long road ahead'', April 9). I am one of the one million workers who have been left behind by the scheme. I am a full-time university student, employed in three casual jobs and live with my grandparents, unsupported by my parents. Two weeks ago, I lost my primary casual job as a receptionist where I was working 30 hours a week. I began working there nine months ago, making me ineligible for the government's JobKeeper payments despite me still being employed in my other casual job at McDonald's for more than six years. I went to Centrelink, who decided I'm ineligible for JobSeeker payments due to my full-time studies so I must apply for Youth Allowance. I am 21 and seven months but Youth Allowance classifies me as a dependent until the age of 22. How can the government have failed to consider these circumstances and similar situations many young people find themselves in? Tahlia Scheffer, Mount Riverview The federal government and the states are trying a balancing act between minimising financial hardship and sending the country broke. The theory behind what they are doing is admirable. However, I hope there will be a concrete deadline when these benefits will be stopped, because there are several anomalies which may make a significant percentage of those out of work not want to go back. If you were unemployed or on other benefits well before March 1, you were already getting a handout from the government. It is ludicrous that they will now get even more money. Also, the average casual worker earns about $460 per week. How on earth did they come up with a $750? It is all very well to give people a helping hand, but the next generation will still be paying off this debt. Jeff Cook, West Pennant Hills To spend $130 billion of other people's money to save the country is not ""brave"". Bravery will come when it's time to pay the money back. Will future governments stare down the vested interests, or will it be the easy neo-liberal way of taking money from the poor, public education, health and welfare? Brenton McGeachie, Queanbeyan West In gradually flattening the curve, we have proof now that good government relies on rigorous expert advice, and everyone working together to solve problems (""Retailers encouraged to start reopening stores"", April 9). Next, we need the same applied to our scarily warming planet, and unjust, unaffordable housing. Sue Young, Bensville An early re-start of the NRL season would lead to more deaths of our loved ones (''Game on for rugby league?'', April 9). Early resumption of televised games would poison community resolve for social distancing and send the clear message that self-isolation is not as important as corporate sport finances. It seems that there are certain privileged groups within our community that do not have to abide by the same rules as the rest of us. It is time that the NRL set aside selfish self-interest for players and executives of the game and put community welfare first. The ethically questionable practice of the NRL and sponsoring networks of continuing to maintain play in packed stadiums right up until it was banned by government decree, and now attempting to restart at the earliest opportunity demonstrates a cavalier disregard for the vulnerable. Keith Sloan, East Ballina No, John Barilaro, the NRL is not ''the tonic we need to get through this virus''. That comes from the continued discipline of self-isolation and hygiene measures and certainly not from teams of boofy footballers manhandling each other. NRL games continued, with the blessing of the Prime Minister, for too long at the onset of this pandemic and there is no logical reason for their resumption. John Byrne, Randwick ''The tonic the state and nation needs to get through the virus''? That's medically unfounded. Alexander Elliott, Bilgola Plateau Can someone please get it into the stubborn, irresponsible heads of the NRL, and seemingly some in government too, that this pandemic will not be over by May 21 nor June 21, nor any date until there are no new cases for at least a month, ideally not until there is a vaccine? As they did by starting the season in the first place, by even considering a resumption the NRL are treating the virus, their players and the public with arrogant contempt. Paul Cunningham, Frenchs Forest If the NRL competition resumes next month, will NSW Police be on hand to enforce the regulations regarding restricted gatherings and social distancing? Rod Allan, Kelso Only one word springs to mind: madness. No one can guarantee that this is a risk-free exercise. Graham Russell, Clovelly Border Force was set up by the Coalition to keep our borders safe. The officers were given military uniforms and its operations were kept secret. Most voters realised that the setting up of Border Force was a political exercise, designed to win votes for the Coalition because it was being ''tough'' on boat people (''Border Force allowed Ruby Princess back into Sydney'', April 9). Now it seems to be the case that Border Force, so good at keeping hapless refugees out, has failed Australians when it has been put to a real test. Geoff Black, Caves Beach Border Farce. Philip Bell, Bronte Illustration: Matt GoldingCredit:  It is alarming that the category in the data table for spending during the past week shows a 67 per cent increase in online gambling and a 33 per cent in tobacco and alcohol purchases (“Stimulus spending attests spending slump”, April 9). It is to be hoped that there will be sufficient support for the families who are adversely affected by these increases as we continue to be confined to our homes for all but essential purposes. Sandra Burke, North Sydney  The damage gambling does to society’s fabric is well known and I am always disturbed when I see the adverts on  TV for gambling websites. Given the tough line Australian governments have taken to protect the fabric of Australian society during this COVID-19 crisis, and notwithstanding said governments’ addiction to the revenue streams from this accursed activity, might now not be a great time to ban those adverts on TV? With TAB, clubs and pubs shut during this crisis, this would also be an ideal time to rein in our seeming national addiction to this detestable and disabling activity. Brian King, Wyee Point With Virgin Australia asking for a government ""bridging"" loan of $1.4 billion to be converted to ownership if they cannot repay it, they are in essence agreeing to a possible part-nationalisation (''Labor backs Virgin's bid for lifeline'', April 9). Perhaps the government should look at nationalising both Qantas and Virgin Australia, amalgamating them into a new publicly owned airline and letting the hoi polloi enjoy some of the future possible profits instead of always financing the losses. Then again, pigs might fly. Stewart Smith, Tea Gardens  No one, regardless of political persuasion, would wish to see Prime Minister Johnson suffering from the virus and I genuinely wish him a speedy recovery (Letters, April 9). As a get-well greeting, I have just posted him a card with a comb inside and instructions on how to use it. Terry Charleston, Cootamundra Here's a question from a golf tragic: why is it, when every health authority is imploring people daily to stay at home, golf clubs across the state are allowed to remain open, thus ensuring that people will leave home, travel and gather together (''Here are the COVID-19 rules - stop looking for loopholes'', April 9)? Peter Thomas, Rose Bay I have bad news and good news for Tony Recsei (Letters, April 9). The bad: the high-density bus left the stop long ago and apartment dwellers in convenient locations are loving it. The good: The vast majority of Sydney is still low density. John Christie, Oatley What a pity that the most widely circulated news articles about the amazingly talented country-folk singer songwriter John Prine was of his obituary dying of the coronavirus (''Virus claims folk legend John Prine'', April 9). This was an artist whose songs were mini-novellas about people or situations many of us have experienced or could relate to; that’s why artists such as Dylan and Springsteen praised his genius for songwriting. Far too many singers with little ability have become household names while people such as Prine are known only on the fringes of music. Fortunately it’s not too late to still listen to his songs. He will be missed. Con Vaitsas, Ashbury I agree with your correspondents on the need to observe the practice of keeping left (Letters, April 9). However, in these advancing years, doing so on stairways and escalators poses the problem of contamination of my ""eating hand"" from touching handrails and other steadying objects.

""We are faced with an unprecedented situation and our focus is firmly on keeping people in jobs and businesses in business,"" he said. ""At a time when lots of people are doing it tough pay rises are not top of my list."" The Berejiklian government has been developing a range of measures to help healthcare workers, including free accommodation to give doctors, nurses, paramedics and other hospital and ambulance staff the option of staying in out-of-home accommodation during the pandemic. Local health districts will work with staff to make sure accommodation is close to work or their families, depending on individual needs. The government will spend almost $60 million on the free accommodation as well as $25 million in funding for medical research and vaccine trials to help develop a cure to beat COVID-19.

There are also plans for bed numbers to quadruple as the state prepares for severe coronavirus cases. Mr Perrottet is also finalising plans for residential rent relief, which is likely to include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on savings to tenants. It is expected details of the plan will be outlined within days as landlords report tenants are implementing rent strikes. Any measures will focus on people who have been financially impacted by the health crisis. The Treasurer is also working on a package to help commercial and retail tenants stay afloat, which is likely to include rent freezes for commercial tenants and loan repayment holidays for landlords.

Arts Minister Don Harwin photographed shopping at Eastgardens Westfield in South Sydney on March 22.

Mr Harwin has been under pressure since it emerged on Wednesday night that he had been commuting to the Central Coast property despite the Berejiklian government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. Arts Minister Don Harwin photographed shopping at Eastgardens Westfield in South Sydney on March 22.  The Sydney Morning Herald has confirmed he was shopping at Westfield Eastgardens shopping centre in Sydney’s south-east on March 22 - about 20 mins drive from his Sydney home in Elizabeth Bay. A spokesman for Mr Harwin confirmed the Minister relocated to his Pearl Beach home on March 13, but returned to Sydney less than a week later on March 19th for ""essential meetings"". Mr Harwin remained in Sydney for five days, squeezing in a shopping trip to Westfield Eastgardens before returning to Pearl Beach after a one-day special sitting of Parliament on March 24. He travelled to Sydney again on April 1 for one day to attend a doctor's appointment.

NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the states had been working on ideas for rent relief following this week's national cabinet meeting. NSW is finalising residential rent relief as tenants are hit by the financial impact of the coronavirus. Credit:Jim Rice “Offering a degree of land tax waiver or deferral for landlords is something we are finalising,"" Mr Perrottet said. But Mr Perrottet urged tenants to keep paying rent. The government is keen to ensure relief measures only apply to people whose finances have been hit by the coronavirus crisis. ""Obviously many people are worried about keeping a roof over their head, but I don't believe something like a rent strike will ultimately help either party,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This is a complicated area and both sides face challenges, and I urge landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions at this extremely difficult time."" Rents are expected to drop in coming months, experts say, as a surge in rental properties combines with a drop in tenant demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19. The number of rentals hitting the Sydney market over the past three weeks was up 18 per cent year-on-year, according to Domain figures. A return of short-term holiday rentals to the longer-term market, a change in tenant circumstances and a drop off in migration are all behind the jump, according to Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell. ""The big question is if this is going to continue. If it does, we will see downward pressure on rents,"" Dr Powell said. Median Sydney asking rents rebounded over the first quarter — after reaching their lowest levels in years — according to the latest Domain Rent Report, but the turnaround could be over before it's truly begun. Median rents rose 1 per cent for houses to $530 a week, and 2 per cent for units to $520 a week, off the back of a fall in unit completions at a time of steady population growth, Dr Powell said. House rents are still $20 lower and unit rents $30 lower than the 2017-18 peak. ""Sydney house rents rose for the first time in three years and unit rents rose for the first time in two years ... [but] this trend is expected to be short-lived,"" Dr Powell said. Meanwhile, Sydney's vacancy rate rose 20 basis points in March to 2.7 per cent, after trending down since mid-2019. There were an estimated 14,528 vacant rentals at the end of the month – 845 more than the previous month, with some landlords already slashing rents by hundreds of dollars a week to attract tenants. Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty. While the federal government has put a moratorium on rental evictions for six months, it has left the provision of further rental assistance to states and territories. For now tenants are required to negotiate rent relief with their property manager or landlord – with mixed results. Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, expected vacancy rates to rise sharply over the short term and said asking rents were already starting to fall. ""At one stage Sydney was recording annual rent declines of 5 per cent, and then towards the end of last year rents started to stabilise; it's very possible we could see yet another 5 per cent decline but we don't know yet, we need to see the fallout first,"" he said. Mr Christopher said vacancy rates would also be impacted by the number of new homes being completed. While completions are on the decline, an expected pull back in buyer and tenant demand could lead to an oversupply of new homes. He added rental markets in Sydney and Melbourne, which take the lion's share of net migration from overseas, were likely to take the biggest hit. Maria Carlino, the national head of property management at The Agency, has seen the number of rental listings across the eastern seaboard jump about 30 per cent in recent weeks. At the same time, property inquiries from potential tenants have dropped about 35 per cent and days on market have increased. The increase in available rentals was giving tenants more choice and opportunity to negotiate, Ms Carlino said. Meanwhile, The Agency is also working through hundreds of requests for help, with tenants across 15 per cent of its Sydney portfolio seeking some form of rent relief. Ms Carlino said most landlords were understanding of tenants in genuine need of assistance, but many were awaiting further government announcements.

Mr Boulten said the Director of Public Prosecutions would have opposed a judge-alone trial anyway. Hayne, 32, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of aggravated sexual assault involving a woman in NSW's Hunter Valley. Judge Ellis agreed to vacate the May 4 trial date and ordered a new trial to begin on November 23. Prosecutor Wayne Creasey SC said the Crown accepted the new trial date. Hayne, who was excused from attending court, will not have to appear in person again until November 19 to confirm which judge will preside over the trial. The trial is expected to take two weeks. Judge Ellis agreed to a defence request to vary Hayne's bail so he no longer has to report to police once a week. The case will next return to court on July 2 for pre-trial argument over a subpoena.

While the fateful events unfolded slowly and quietly in the cabins, passengers continued to party, enjoying their holiday of a lifetime and, until the end, the cruise company ensured it was business as usual, and life on board went on. While the scale of the disaster that is the Ruby Princess is far greater, and its global context unprecedented in modern times, there are striking similarities with another cruise ship death – that of Brisbane mother Dianne Brimble, who died alone in September 2002 on board the Pacific Sky. Dianne Brimble: A cruise ship tragedy that provides a cautionary tale about leaping to conclusions before a thorough investigation of the Ruby Princess case.  Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. Replay   That said, cruise companies are businesses. They know the basic rules of public relations: co-operate with the investigation, apologise, replace the chief executive, all in the hope it will allow survival long enough to start a new chapter. Cruise passenger numbers actually exploded after Brimble’s death, despite the negative publicity. Cruising will likely survive this crisis too. But it is certain there will be other deaths, diseases and tragedies on board cruise ships in the future.The international Cruise Victims Association, represented in Australia by Mark Brimble, Dianne’s former husband, issued a recent statement about the coronavirus crisis six days before the Ruby Princess disembarked its passengers in Sydney. It called on the cruise industry to ""cease the practice of business as usual"" and to suspend its operations in US ports, citing data on the industry’s deficiency in controlling viral outbreaks on ships. “This situation will not be remedied by continuing business as usual,” the ICV said. Hopefully, that’s where the similarities between these two tragedies end, and this police investigation will result in change that disrupts the ""business as usual"" attitude in cruising.

Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. Replay   That said, cruise companies are businesses. They know the basic rules of public relations: co-operate with the investigation, apologise, replace the chief executive, all in the hope it will allow survival long enough to start a new chapter. Cruise passenger numbers actually exploded after Brimble’s death, despite the negative publicity. Cruising will likely survive this crisis too. But it is certain there will be other deaths, diseases and tragedies on board cruise ships in the future.The international Cruise Victims Association, represented in Australia by Mark Brimble, Dianne’s former husband, issued a recent statement about the coronavirus crisis six days before the Ruby Princess disembarked its passengers in Sydney. It called on the cruise industry to ""cease the practice of business as usual"" and to suspend its operations in US ports, citing data on the industry’s deficiency in controlling viral outbreaks on ships. “This situation will not be remedied by continuing business as usual,” the ICV said. Hopefully, that’s where the similarities between these two tragedies end, and this police investigation will result in change that disrupts the ""business as usual"" attitude in cruising.

William Allen Corley, from West Ryde, was arrested in January by Australian Federal Police over allegations he made more than 395 transactions to recipients in the Philippines to fund child sex abuse over many years. A Sydney man has been charged with possessing child abuse material and dealing with and producing child pornography material outside Australia. On Tuesday the 63-year-old was granted bail in the NSW Supreme Court after $30,000 was posted by his brother, who the court found to be an ""acceptable person"". The decision by Justice Michael Walton was delivered via a virtual courtroom, as a result of social distancing measures introduced in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Strict bail conditions include surrendering his passport, living at a specified address on the NSW South Coast, reporting daily to Nowra police station and not drinking alcohol or using drugs. He is also not to be in the presence of any child under the age of 16, unless ""in the direct company of another adult,"" nor is he to loiter within 300 meters of any school, childcare, preschool or playground. Mr Corley has been charged with possessing child abuse material and dealing with and producing child pornography material outside Australia. His arrest followed a report alleging he had regularly travelled to the Philippines and was suspected of engaging in criminal offences, most recently in November. During a subsequent raid on his home investigators allegedly located child abuse material and seized smart phones, cameras, travel documents, diaries and handwritten notes allegedly linked to criminal behaviour in the Philippines. Mr Corley is next scheduled to appear at Burwood Local Court on June 3. He is yet to enter a plea. It follows a separate unrelated case of a 52-year-old Melbourne man, who was sentenced last month for the sexual abuse of Filipina minors and the production of child sexual exploitation materials. The man was employed as a commercial international flight attendant and travelled to the Philippines on a regular basis, offending against 26 female children over seven years. He pleaded guilty to more than 30 offences and was sentenced to 18 years' and six months in prison. In another unrelated case this week the AFP also charged western Sydney man Sam Piccinelli, 24, with possessing and sharing almost 7000 files categorised as child abuse material. On Wednesday he pleaded not guilty and was granted strict conditional bail at Penrith Local Court, where he will next appear on June 5.

Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak.

However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I’ve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don’t want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‘Mum’ again but this time I was actually right! It’s been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all – in a way that a son caught smoking his father’s cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the “can robots replace teachers one day?” debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun – almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: “Isn't this exciting!” I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I’ve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we’d have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me – well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can’t explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren’t for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself … Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It’s the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it’s like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn’t have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we’ve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon – and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I’m still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can’t help but be sad that we’re missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I’ve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I’m constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn’t fill me with motivation. I’m not a super eager student and I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can’t see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can’t pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can’t hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

32,/national/nsw/i-never-thought-i-d-say-it-but-i-miss-going-to-school-20200409-p54ik5.html,"'I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school'","By Natassia Chrysanthos Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon Almost 500 NSW students wrote to the Herald this week about their experiences of home learning while they bunker down and stay away from school as part of the national effort to stall the spread of coronavirus. Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak. It feels as though our history textbooks have come to life, doesn’t it?Vania Zakerfathi, 14, Asquith Lola Christopoulos, 11, from Drummoyne.Credit:Lola Christopoulos 2020 began with blackened skies and a constant dangerous smoky haze as we dealt with the threat of the massive bushfires surrounding us in the Snowy Mountains. However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I’ve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don’t want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‘Mum’ again but this time I was actually right! It’s been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all – in a way that a son caught smoking his father’s cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the “can robots replace teachers one day?” debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun – almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: “Isn't this exciting!” I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I’ve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we’d have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me – well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can’t explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant.

The Herald wants to hear about your experience of doing lessons at home. We're asking NSW school students of all ages to write us a letter of no more than 200 words, describing their thoughts and feelings about remote learning over the past few weeks. Students could address questions such as; do you like doing lessons at home? What do you miss most about school? What have been the best bits about staying home for school, and what are the things you have found hardest? We will choose a selection of letters from students of different ages to print in a special edition of the letters page. We are most likely to choose letters that use clear, concise language; offer a personal perspective; and comply with the word limit (the shorter the better!). Mum and dad can help type up the letters, but we want them to be students' own work. Please send your letters to education@smh.com.au by midday on Wednesday.

She didn’t, as it was deemed non-essential travel."" Caitlin Allen of Mosman submits an example of a bit of levity to help with a challenging situation. ""My husband was in charge of home-schooling our six-year-old son for the day. To get in the mood, at 8.45am they played a couple of rounds of Beyblades, chased each other around the apartment for a couple of minutes, then lined up behind a piece of tape on the carpet and called the (very short) roll."" Like Graham Russell, Brian Collins of Cronulla has also noticed the influx of dog walkers (C8) while out on his own walk. ""I am considering the marketing possibilities of producing a new dog lead exactly 1.5 metres long,"" he writes. The mass dislocation of shoulders can now cease. Joan Brown of Orange cautions: ""Surely it’s physically impossible to cough into one’s elbow as we are being urged to do? Shouldn't it be into 'the crook of one's arm'?"" ""Like Hugh Barrett (C8), I too have been called anti-social,"" writes Robert Silvestrini of Fairfield West. ""I prefer to call myself 'selectively social'."" In a similar vein, the naturally anti-social Peter Skinner of Beecroft had often worried about ""the post-mortem humiliation of no one turning up to my funeral. Thanks to COVID-19 I can still pass away unlamented, but not alone."" ""Did Hugh perchance choose Sanctuary Point for its name and/or locality to cater for his need for social isolation (C8),"" queries Richard Hambly of Potts Point. ""Is this a case of 'domiciled determinism'?"" Keith Russell of Mayfield West (Qld) has a novel idea. ""Let's mint a 1000-piece 3D jigsaw (C8) of ScoMo in honour of his visions."" More humour in the darkest of places. Amid all the little notes on the board outside IGA Gerringong, Alex Hamill of Gerroa noticed this gem: ""To the person who stole my anti-depressants, I hope you are happy."" Margaret Gallagher of Fingal Bay wonders if this is the time to increase the limit on tapping credit so that we can do away with the need to touch so many keys.

35,/national/nsw/ready-to-help-3d-printed-face-shields-used-to-combat-nsw-shortage-20200408-p54i5k.html,'Ready to help': 3D-printed face shields used to combat NSW shortage,"Doctors and health authorities are turning to academics and creative volunteers to make face shields for frontline workers, in a bid to combat a widespread shortage of critical personal protective equipment. Professor Gordon Wallace, of the University of Wollongong, said the institution was approached by the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district to manufacture face shields and make prototypes for spare ventilator parts. Blake Cochran is developing creative solutions to the protective equipment shortage.Credit:James Brickwood ""It’s all really been driven by them and their needs,"" he said. ""We’re here and ready to help."" The university, in collaboration with two local 3D printing companies, has been asked to produce 3000 face shields over the next three weeks. The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said. Universities are not used to manufacturing products, Associate Professor Mukerjee said, but if their prototype equipment was needed and deemed fit for purpose, it was possible for those institutions to scale up. “We need to all think differently and start stepping out of our comfort zone,” she said. It's not just universities helping. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer At Marrickville, volunteers are using the clear plastic covers of unused office binders, sheets of foam and metres of double-sided tape to make protective face shields at the behest of one Sydney doctor. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor said volunteers for the not-for-profit - which recycles industrial waste for creative purposes - had made 700 shields, with another 700 on the way. “They’re not glamorous, they’re not pretty, but that’s what Reverse Garbage does,"" Ms Junor said. ""It's about looking at things differently."" NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback. Dr Blake Cochran, a medical researcher and lecturer at UNSW, said it took just a couple of days to go from talking about potentially creating a face shield prototype to having products ready to test. “I never thought I'd work with industrial designers, it’s a creative approach to things,” he said. The face shields have been the focus of the UNSW team, but Dr Cochran said they would be happy to try designing something else. All it would take, he said, was for hospitals, local health districts or the health department to say “this is exactly what we need”. “Whatever the next need is, we’ve got really good people to help develop solutions,” he said. Ms Junor said demand for the face shields had been rising, prompting Reverse Garbage to call for donations to help stay open. ""Humans are so good at rallying,"" she said.

Professor Gordon Wallace, of the University of Wollongong, said the institution was approached by the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district to manufacture face shields and make prototypes for spare ventilator parts.

""We’re here and ready to help."" The university, in collaboration with two local 3D printing companies, has been asked to produce 3000 face shields over the next three weeks. The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said. Universities are not used to manufacturing products, Associate Professor Mukerjee said, but if their prototype equipment was needed and deemed fit for purpose, it was possible for those institutions to scale up. “We need to all think differently and start stepping out of our comfort zone,” she said. It's not just universities helping. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer At Marrickville, volunteers are using the clear plastic covers of unused office binders, sheets of foam and metres of double-sided tape to make protective face shields at the behest of one Sydney doctor. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor said volunteers for the not-for-profit - which recycles industrial waste for creative purposes - had made 700 shields, with another 700 on the way. “They’re not glamorous, they’re not pretty, but that’s what Reverse Garbage does,"" Ms Junor said. ""It's about looking at things differently."" NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback.

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said while it might be disappointing for people to stay at home, police will be out patrolling highways, country roads and caravan parks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said police will be patrolling back roads and caravan parks to ensure people are adhering to social distancing measures. Credit:Kate Geraghty ""We will be going through caravan parks early, issuing warnings to people that may think they can get around these laws,"" Commissioner Fuller said on Wednesday. ""People will be given one opportunity to pack up, go back to your home state and go back home. Otherwise, we will, unfortunately, have to issue tickets."" Double demerit points will kick in on Thursday morning, but Mr Fuller warned police would also be using number plate recognition and cameras to ensure people are cooperating with authorities' no travel requests, unless they have a good reason. ""We will be using all of our powers and all of our technology to try and identify those people who shouldn't be in NSW,"" he said. Since March 17, police have issued 11 court attendance notices, and 136 penalty infringement notices for breaches of the Public Health Act. Since the last update on Monday, police have fined 15 people, including a man who was sitting at a picnic table at a shopping mall in Mt Druitt on Tuesday.  Police spoke with the 20-year-old and established he had been warned on three separate occasions the day before when he was seen at the same location. He was issued with a $1000 fine. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the tough measures would be reviewed on a monthly basis in line with health advice, but added she didn't want to ""raise expectations"" they could be relaxed by May. ""If the advice in a couple of weeks is that there might be a couple of aspects we can tweak to provide relief to our citizens then we will take that advice,"" she said. Replay   The Premier stressed that relaxing the rules could have serious consequences, and social distancing measures requiring people to remain a safe distance from one another would remain until a vaccine is found. ""Every time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick. More people will die,"" she said. The number of coronavirus cases continues to stabilise in NSW, with 48 new cases confirmed since the last update on Tuesday. The state's total confirmed cases stands at 2734.  The death toll is 21. There are 227 people being treated by NSW Health, including 36 patients in intensive care and 22 of those are ventilated. For businesses, including the Sydney Fish Markets, the Easter long weekend is their busiest time. But this year, people entering the markets will have their temperatures taken and those who are unwell will not be allowed in. Sydney Fish Market chief executive Greg Dyer said about 400 people will be allowed into the markets at any one time, while 150 cars will be allowed in the car park. Sydney Fish markets will be operating over the Easter weekend but with increased health measures. Credit:Rhett Wyman ""Once we get to that limit, we will have to have people waiting off site or turned away,"" he said. NSW Police Force Superintendent Commander Gavin Wood said police would be present at the markets to ensure people adhere to social distancing measures. ""Please be patient -  it may be slightly different, it might be slightly disruptive to what we have seen historically, but people will get their seafood.""

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio the Easter long weekend was not an excuse for people to travel anywhere and people should not be going for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says going for a drive with no intentions of getting out of the car is not a reasonable excuse to be out. Credit:Kate Geraghty ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said of driving. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Exemptions to the rules include travelling to work, getting food, medical assistance, or to exercise. On Sunday, a Victorian learner driver received a $1652 fine when she and her mother went for a driving lesson. The fine was later revoked. Since March 17, police have issued 10 court attendance notices, and 122 penalty infringement notices for breaches of the Public Health Act. Mr Fuller said last week he will review every notice. Authorities are urging people to stay at home over the Easter break. Credit:Kate Geraghty NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said while there were no plans to close the state's border, people should not travel this Easter weekend. ""None of us can travel, none of us can go on holidays,"" she said. ""We cannot have communities who currently don't have the virus to get contaminated unintentionally because people are moving around when they shouldn't. ""I know how devastating this is for families who feel that they've been cooped up in their homes, and for people like me, who were looking forward to the holidays."" Ms Berejiklian said social distancing measures will remain amid the coronavirus pandemic until a vaccine is found as the number of new cases continues to stabilise. ""That is the new normal,"" she said. ""Not having physical contact, socially distancing is, at the very minimum, a way of life for us. Because we have to be honest with ourselves - until a vaccine is found, there is no simple way to deal with this issue."" The state's total number of COVID-19 cases stands at 2686, with 49 new cases since the last update on Monday. Of the 229 cases being treated, 37 people are in intensive care with 24 people requiring ventilators. The NSW death toll has risen to 21. Replay   There were 406 locally acquired cases from an unknown source. The Premier said this category is causing health authorities the greatest level of concern. In a bid to tackle the community transmission, NSW Health announced it would expand testing in 13 areas, including Waverley, Ryde, Port Macquarie, Broken Hill and Nowra. For South Coast tourist operators, already devastated by the bushfires, this crisis has increased their financial pressures. Narooma Charters owner Norm Ingersole has been forced to stop his tours but is keeping his tackle shop open for as long as he can to cover rent. Narooma Charters joint owner Norm Ingersole said urging people to stay at home over Easter is the right thing to do. Credit:Louise Kennerley ""God knows how we will pay the rest of the bills,"" he said. Following the fires, heavy flooding impacted parts of the South Coast and a few weeks later many businesses were forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. ""We've been flogged,"" Mr Ingersole said. While turning tourists away will worsen Mr Ingersole's financial situation, he said it's the right call. ""We are all supportive of them saying, 'please don't come',"" he said. ""Please save your money up and come out at the end of the lockdown."" But not everyone has heard the advice, with some tourists asking Mr Ingersole to run a private charter or run fishing trips - all of which he has turned down. Deputy Premier John Barilaro urged people to cancel holiday bookings and stay at home over the long weekend. ""My message cannot be clearer, it cannot be simpler. Do not come,"" he said.
