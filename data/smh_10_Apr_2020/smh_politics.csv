The national cabinet has begun discussing how it might gently wind back tough restrictions as the number of new coronavirus cases continues to fall, but authorities warn the coming days will be critical in attempts to consolidate efforts to curb infections. Health Minister Greg Hunt said there had been a ""genuine consolidation"" of the virus.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen It is likely entire states, such as South Australia and Western Australia, and possibly geographical regions could be used as guinea pigs to trial relaxing the unprecedented restrictions and test the impact of easing the shutdown of businesses such as cafes, restaurants, pubs and gyms. Australia recorded its lowest daily rate of coronavirus infections in more than three weeks on Thursday in what the federal government said was a ""genuine consolidation"" of the virus, with just 96 new cases in 24 hours. There have been 6103 confirmed cases in Australia and 51 people have died. About 260 people are in hospital, with 82 in intensive care and 35 on ventilators. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was clear social-distancing measures were slowing the spread of the virus but Australians would be living with them for at least six months. ""Restrictions will be reviewed regularly and planning for the medium to long-term has begun,"" he said. The spread of the virus has been more contained in SA and WA than on the east coast, meaning those states would likely be in a position to act sooner, providing a guide for Victoria and NSW. Queensland Liberal MP Andrew Laming, a medical specialist and former infectious disease researcher, said on Thursday the government should begin to plan the subtle rolling back of the most extreme restrictions in areas where it was safe to do so as the coronavirus infection curve began to flatten. He said efforts to flatten the curve were both impressive and reassuring and the sooner localised trials began to restore ""something like normal life"", the better. Replay   Dr Laming said national cabinet needed to carefully trial the unlocking of ""cooler spots"" that were well away from areas of high caseloads. ""The only way to understand how to deal with the next stage of COVID-19 is for public health experts to cautiously trial local relaxations,"" he said. ""We will need to closely monitor regional relaxations, fully supported from the top level of political leadership and clearly explained in regular media addresses."" Mr Hunt said there had been a ""genuine consolidation"" of the virus. Thursday was the first day in more than three weeks fewer than 100 people had been added to the list. ""That's an exceptionally important development for Australia. Fewer cases, fewer risks, fewer lives at risk. But we've got a long way to go,"" Mr Hunt said. ""The virus does not take a holiday - therefore none of us can relax what we do. This in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus."" Mr Hunt said if Australians stayed home and locked in ""the gains that we've made as a nation"" it would ""give ourselves the pathway through"", but warned social-distancing measures and bans on mass gatherings would likely be in place for six months or more.

Although tough measures imposed on the public by governments to halt the spread of COVID-19 are broadly supported, about two in five Australians say they are making life “very difficult”, with young people and those living in the inner suburbs finding them the hardest to deal with. Australians are struggling with the impact of physical distancing restrictions on their lives. Credit:Peter Rae Newgate Research's weekly tracking study of more than 1000 Australians, taken between Monday and Wednesday, has found people are struggling most with the lack of social interaction, impacts on their income, having to stay at home and being unable to exercise like they usually would. Community alarm about coronavirus remains very high although it has dipped for the first time in the five surveys conducted since the start of March, with 63 per cent “extremely concerned” about it, compared to 74 per cent last week. This easing of concern is mostly being driven by a growing belief the spread of the virus is being brought under control and it will get better over the next few months. More than a quarter of respondents said having no social interactions or not being able to see family members have been the most difficult changes to deal with, while almost one in four Australians (24 per cent) found losing their job or an income source were the biggest challenges. The survey found the current economic impacts continue to bite despite a dip in the overall level of concern, with around two thirds of Australians now spending less money than they usually do, while 43 per cent have had their income reduced. One in five respondents say they have been laid off however there was been a slight drop in concern about job security, with 67 per cent now ""extremely"" or ""quite"" concerned, compared to 71 per cent last week. Replay   Newgate Research managing director Sue Vercoe said for now most Australians were continuing to follow instructions in relation to social distancing, with nearly nine in 10 avoiding all non-essential contact, avoiding shaking hands and staying at home. Ms Vercoe said despite a significant level of hardship there was continued confidence in Australia's leaders as well as the health system and other institutions managing and responding to the crisis. The survey found there had also been another significant increase in the proportion who believe Australia is responding appropriately to coronavirus, 66 per cent up from 56 per cent last week, taking it to the highest point so far. ""Australians’ advice to government and business leaders this week is to continue to take tough measures to stop the spread of the virus,"" Ms Vercoe said. ""Through border restrictions, quarantines and restrictions on public gatherings and to support this with clear and accurate information and financial assistance for those who have been impacted.""

Federal, state and territory leaders are still finalising what term two will look like across the country after the school holidays. Education ministers are weighing up options for a staggered shift towards more normal school operations, which could see year 12 students and those in more hands-on subjects returning to campuses for some sessions. Education Minister Dan Tehan has directed private schools to be open. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The national cabinet meeting on Thursday discussed schools, focusing on a coherent approach after Easter holidays amid confusion among parents and teachers. Government sources said the leaders were working towards a more consistent national position on which children should be attending school, although no decisions have been made. While most private schools have been maintaining in-person supervision options for children of essential services workers in addition their rollout of distance learning, Mr Tehan has written to independent school peak bodies highlighting a ""small number"" that have closed their campuses entirely. ""While I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,"" Mr Tehan wrote. He said the students might be children of essential workers but added pupils should ""not be refused physical classroom access based on their parent's employment"". Under federal legislation, Mr Tehan has the authority to impose additional conditions on funding for private schools. He said he was using this power to include a condition starting from term two ""requiring schools to provide a physical classroom education environment for the children of parents who choose to access it"". Mr Tehan told reporters on Thursday he wanted schools to be open for safety reasons. ""We want them open so children can be safely cared for if their parents are working or if there are other reasons where children are much more safe at school rather than at home,"" he said. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week? Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students – would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" Victorian students are scheduled to return to school on April 14 under an online learning model. NSW students are due to return on April 27. Attendance, which plummeted in March, could rise after the holidays. Medical officials are looking at how to make schools safer, with bolstered hygiene and social distancing measures.

""We want them open so children can be safely cared for if their parents are working or if there are other reasons where children are much more safe at school rather than at home,"" he said. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week? Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students – would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" Victorian students are scheduled to return to school on April 14 under an online learning model. NSW students are due to return on April 27. Attendance, which plummeted in March, could rise after the holidays. Medical officials are looking at how to make schools safer, with bolstered hygiene and social distancing measures.

Parliament has set a legislated deadline in the fight against the coronavirus by approving a six-month sunset clause for the new $130 billion JobKeeper wage subsidy. Illustration: Jim Pavlidis
Credit:  The boost to confidence is significant when the economic support is combined with the sharp fall in new infections. But this virus sets its own timetable. While the politicians offer reassurance, the scientists urge vigilance. And it is worth heeding the science. The medical experts who advise the government expect this threat to continue in waves for years. Even if we eradicate the disease in Australia, says James McCaw of the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, the virus will spread around the world and easily return. “That epidemic in some places may also go locally extinct after a small or a large wave,” he says. “But it’s almost implausible to imagine this virus going extinct globally, which means that it will be here to stay. It will become a part of our everyday life and the transition to it not being a huge driver of complete societal change is a very difficult thing to work through.” Complete societal change. Good luck putting a six-month deadline on that. McCaw is a mathematical biologist. His colleague at the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, Jodie McVernon, is a doctor and epidemiologist. Together they led the scientific work that underpinned the government modelling released this week. The public modelling was underwhelming because it was based on overseas data from weeks ago, but this highlights the way huge decisions had to be made in rapid succession with limited data in recent weeks. There are good questions about the work so far. Why is there no public modelling using local case numbers? When can we know whether closing a bar is more effective than shutting a school? The answers will take weeks. The truth is the country’s top scientists are working under immense pressure to focus a microscope on a moving target. Their advice this week, in a teleconference held after Scott Morrison released the modelling, was to be wary of assumptions about what happens next. So the way out is yet to be found. Morrison rejects the strategy of herd immunity – the idea the country could be resistant after the infection reached perhaps 60 per cent of the population – and Health Minister Greg Hunt aims to keep infections well below 2.9 million people (the implied figure in the most benign published scenario). But they also know that suppressing the virus for too long will drag out the economic damage. A point comes where too many restrictions will work against the country as a whole, and where calculations are made about the cost of saving lives. The medical experts are grappling with this challenge. “There is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm,” wrote Tony Blakely, a University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology (but not one of the Doherty Institute team) for The Conversation this week. “Lockdowns, for example, cause drops in GDP and increases in unemployment. That feeds back on to changes in suicide and heart disease. We need to quantify that, and weigh it up.” This will be the next phase in the debate. With more modelling about the shutdowns, rather than the virus alone, the argument will shift towards easing the constraints. Inside the Morrison government, one of the worries is that the economic damage could kill more people than the virus. The solution is to relax the restrictions in stages and in different locations. Morrison may want this but cannot dictate the terms. The states and territories will make their own decisions because each has a different case load. It is tempting but misguided to debate a simple calculation – how many lives are worth sacrificing at the altar of the economy? – but the fact is that most of the cost cannot be avoided. The world economy is in shock. Australia cannot stop the slump. Even so, nobody should be naive about the decisions political leaders and their governments must make in this crisis. They have rejected herd immunity but they have not promised eradication; their objective is to manage the deaths without overloading the hospitals. If the scientists are right, the recovery will not run as the politicians wish. While the Parliament’s new law stops the wage subsidies on the last Sunday in September, the virus is a law unto itself. Even if the government halts the JobKeeper payment of $1500 a fortnight, can it really halve the JobSeeker payment of $1100 a fortnight – that is, return to the old Newstart rate – six months from now? Replay   It seems unlikely. It would require Morrison to put jobless Australians back on the old subsistence rate when independent economist Saul Eslake forecasts the ranks of the unemployed will double to almost 1.4 million. The recovery will not be swift enough to make that decision easy. Restaurants may reopen one day but the borders will remain closed. It will be Fortress Australia all this year and beyond. That is why “sovereignty” was Morrison’s key word in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday. Can Australia grow at all when it is locked off from the world? That may be the experiment until a vaccine arrives. McVernon and McCaw are trying to prepare Australians for a lasting change. McCaw cites the Spanish influenza of a century ago as a warning. That epidemic arrived in three waves over nine months but did not stop there. “For the next five or six years there were elevated levels of disease activity from that same virus as it settled down and became a part of our ecosystem,” he says. “And then it was there for decades afterwards.” It is an ugly ecosystem. It is also the future. David Crowe is the chief political correspondent for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

11,/politics/federal/for-a-moment-at-least-our-politicians-are-behaving-like-grown-ups-20200409-p54ilu.html,"For a moment, at least, our politicians are behaving like grown-ups","Here’s both the most heartening and maddening thing about this particular moment in our COVID-19 journey: politics is mostly working very well. Heartening because as relatively similar polities like the UK and the US are discovering, if political leadership fails now, the results can be catastrophic. Maddening because it took a global pandemic to get us here. Illustration: Andrew DysonCredit:  In saying this, I’m not dismissing the idea there are areas of valid critique. The various moments of weak and confusing communication, the suspension of Parliament, the apparently arbitrary and occasionally perverse exclusion of certain kinds of workers from the government’s JobKeeper scheme, and of course the Ruby Princess disaster, all qualify as areas of worthy debate. But use broad brushstrokes for a moment and then consider the picture before us. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  We’ve seen an impressive level of federal-state co-operation where the two tiers of government have each contributed, led and even persuaded each other. The federal government led on shutting borders, for example, while the states pushed the feds to accelerate shutdowns of restaurants, cafes and especially schools. We’ve seen a federal government that has consistently described fiscal stimulus for a flagging economy as reckless, embrace it at unprecedented levels; a government that flatly refused to increase the Newstart allowance suddenly double it; a Liberal-led government introduce a wage subsidy. We’ve seen business, government and the union movement working constructively together to the extent that the Attorney-General and the head of the ACTU are now openly talking about each other like they’re friends. And perhaps most of all, we’ve seen policy-making led by the advice of experts, especially scientists, even when measures carried the risk of economic pain and unpopularity. In sum, we’re seeing a moment of compromise, and largely evidence-led politics, mostly uncorrupted by powerful lobby groups, and where politicians are prepared to change their position when the situation demands it. And that is exactly how you wouldn’t describe the politics we’ve endured over at least the last decade. If, as polling seems to suggest right now, people are more content with the leadership they’re getting than they have been for a long time, it’s worth reflecting on the fact that it might be because politics is the opposite of itself right now. It’s working because it’s breaking its every habit. That’s relatively easy at the moment because every position being adopted is a short-term, emergency posture. You can make peace with sworn enemies more easily if it’s only for a brief period and involves no serious admissions of defeat. But that only goes to show that of all the things we’re witnessing, an abandonment of ideology is not really one of them. The unions still believe the rapid spread of casual work is a problem that needs to be addressed, and the Liberal party still believes in the free market when it isn’t being artificially shuttered by government for reasons that have nothing to do with economics. Those crowing about the Liberal Party’s sudden embrace of communism should probably reflect on the fact that the enormous government spending program we’re seeing now is designed not to remake our economy, but to preserve it. Scott Morrison’s language of “snapping back” and “hibernation” imagines a world that returns to its previous arrangements after a hiatus. It questions no fundamental assumptions about how the economy should generally work. Once this is over, the old ideological contests will probably remain and resume, albeit on altered terrain. Replay   It’s that altered terrain that interests me. Specifically, what is different about it if not ideology. My working theory is that we’re primarily seeing a difference of political culture characterised by two things that have been scarce until now: honesty and sacrifice. Think about it. This is the first time in forever that we’ve heard leaders quite prepared to give us bad news; to tell us that bad things will happen and that we will have to give up certain things and be worse off in various ways for the benefit of society generally. True, some of those sacrifices will be temporary, such as our freedom to move and socialise. But many will inflict long-lasting damage: businesses will be lost, mental health will suffer probably for years. We’re being asked to accept that and sacrifice anyway. This is a whole new language for our politics, which has proceeded on condition that no policy should ever produce losers if it is going to win elections. Anything that does – a carbon tax, superannuation reforms, providing less government funding for, say, Catholic schools than they’d like – dies a merciless death on the spike of a scare campaign. Ours has been mostly a politics of childish fantasy that pretends trade-offs don’t exist, and that the only people who should sacrifice anything are other people. In practical terms that meant people with no clout or power, like the unemployed. Well, we’re in the mother of all trade-offs now: our economy as we know it for our survival. It’s the kind of trade-off to which we’ve proven gallingly hostile when it comes to climate change, for example, even though the economic costs might have been easier to bear and the dangers to be avoided are even greater in the long run. But now, faced with something so swiftly deadly, and with the subordination of lobby groups to the public interest, we’ve been forced into it. I’m not one for predicting sweeping political changes after the pandemic is done. Sure, there might be, but the possibility that people simply retreat to their pre-COVID-19 positions seems just as likely to me. But we might, if we’re lucky, emerge with some new political habits. My cautious hope is for politics that can accept the existence of problems as a starting point for debate, rather than politics that profit from denialism. And I hope it finds an electorate more practised in the art of sacrifice for each other, that might be honoured with more mature and less cynical political debates about who should give up what for whom. Given how shabby the usual offering looks compared to the current one, we could do without politics merely hibernating and snapping back. Waleed Aly is a regular columnist.

We need a steady march to reform - and a broader tax base,"The 1987 federal election campaign was defined by the TV add featuring “whingeing Wendy”, a suburban housewife questioning John Howard from her kitchen, with devastating effect, about the financing of his promised $8 billion tax cut: Where’s the money coming from? Scott Morrison's challenge is to transform the economy, not to wait for it to snap back to its already weak position.
Credit: Jim Pavlidis Wendy listed an emotive range of possible “cuts” – home nursing, meals on wheels, pharmaceutical benefits, asthma and diabetes allowances, pensions, Medicare, child minding centres. The result was an historic third Labor win in a row, with an expanded margin of 24 seats (previously 16), despite a swing of 1 per cent against the government, and a small win by Howard in the popular vote. Howard’s case wasn’t helped when the finally released funding of his tax cuts didn’t add up, compounding the substance of Wendy’s question. While oppositions have always been bedevilled to provide funding detail, governments have struggled with the reality, to deliver responsible, conservative, fiscal management – Fraser undoing Whitlam’s profligacy, Hawke/Keating coming out of global recession and post-Fraser, Keating again after the early-90s recession, and Rudd/Gillard/Abbott/ Turnbull/ Morrison post-global financial crisis. Over the past five decades since 1970, the maximum budget deficit has been a little over 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 90s, and the biggest surplus was about 2 per cent in the early 2000s. The achievement of a budget surplus, a commitment to repay debt, and preservation of global credit rating have become increasing obsessions. Throughout, with the exceptions of the conspicuous periods of largesse under Whitlam and Howard, budgets have been mostly driven by varying degrees of austerity while seeking to avoid new taxes, although there has been a significant reliance on “bracket creep” in personal tax. On the brink of achieving the cherished budget surplus – of being “back in the black” – the impact of COVID-19, the Morrison government has launched fiscal measures worth almost $200 billion so far, about five times the Rudd packages in response to the GFC. Then there is almost a $100 billion liquidity injection from the RBA on top of a near-zero cash rate. Scott Morrison would have us believe all this is temporary, not structural, and that we can “bounce”,  indeed “snap”, back when the virus is under control. But snap back to what? And how quickly? We already had a weak and weakening economy, riddled with significant structural challenges, low business and consumer confidence, record household debt, flat wages, increasing job insecurity, low productivity and a majority struggling to meet a mounting cost of living? Not to mention neglect of the longer-term imperatives such as the transition to a low-carbon society over the next three decades? But what exactly will suddenly give households the confidence to spend, and businesses to invest? Or will government spending have to keep sustaining growth, and if so how will it be paid for? The prospective blowout of hundreds of billions in the budget deficit, and national debt, dwarfs anything since World War II. It will take decades to bring under control. This on top of what were already a host of unfunded commitments – Gonski and education, health, defence, the NDIS, infrastructure, and the legislated tax cuts. Former finance secretary Mike Keating had been predicting an inevitable increase in the overall tax burden of some 2 to 3 per cent of GDP in the 2020s. It will not be possible to stick with commitments to magic budget numbers. And we've learned just how long it will take to restore unemployment rates (likely to at least double) to near-full employment. Does Morrison imagine it will be easy to snap back from having increased the JobSeeker allowance or providing free childcare, or to avoid pressure to convert his JobKeeper payments into a universal living wage? Can he accept many businesses will still fail?  Howard found out just how tough it could be to take back what was given as a benefit, against the expectation that it had become a right. Lessons too from Tony Abbott’s attempt at extreme austerity, especially without effective consultation, that culminated in his failed 2014 budget. Morrison has no alternative but to shift gear into longer-term strategic planning, and to reassess national priorities right across government, industry and civil society, and in our global relations, especially with the US, China and our Asia-Pacific neighbours. This should lead to broad-based tax and reform of expenditure and the federation. More tinkering will be inadequate. Big trade-offs will need to be made, such as scrapping submarines and expensive and ill-considered defence procurement, in favour of important social programs. Infrastructure bonds could make an effective distinction between debt for recurrent spending and that for self-financing capital. We could eliminate or containing expensive and inequitable tax concessions. We should broaden the tax base and scrap profit as the basis of corporate tax. We need better tax arrangements between the federal and state governments and a re-allocation of spending and policy responsibilities. My fear is that the economic disruption and poor growth will last much longer than expected. Without a longer-term strategy, the government’s packages will only serve to compound our debt problems, leading to an ultimate debt crisis.

""The virus does not take a holiday - therefore none of us can relax what we do. This in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus."" Mr Hunt said if Australians stayed home and locked in ""the gains that we've made as a nation"" it would ""give ourselves the pathway through"", but warned social-distancing measures and bans on mass gatherings would likely be in place for six months or more. ""Where we can take early steps that are safe, then we will obviously look to do that,"" he said.

Credit:  The boost to confidence is significant when the economic support is combined with the sharp fall in new infections. But this virus sets its own timetable. While the politicians offer reassurance, the scientists urge vigilance. And it is worth heeding the science. The medical experts who advise the government expect this threat to continue in waves for years. Even if we eradicate the disease in Australia, says James McCaw of the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, the virus will spread around the world and easily return. “That epidemic in some places may also go locally extinct after a small or a large wave,” he says. “But it’s almost implausible to imagine this virus going extinct globally, which means that it will be here to stay. It will become a part of our everyday life and the transition to it not being a huge driver of complete societal change is a very difficult thing to work through.” Complete societal change. Good luck putting a six-month deadline on that. McCaw is a mathematical biologist. His colleague at the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, Jodie McVernon, is a doctor and epidemiologist. Together they led the scientific work that underpinned the government modelling released this week. The public modelling was underwhelming because it was based on overseas data from weeks ago, but this highlights the way huge decisions had to be made in rapid succession with limited data in recent weeks. There are good questions about the work so far. Why is there no public modelling using local case numbers? When can we know whether closing a bar is more effective than shutting a school? The answers will take weeks. The truth is the country’s top scientists are working under immense pressure to focus a microscope on a moving target. Their advice this week, in a teleconference held after Scott Morrison released the modelling, was to be wary of assumptions about what happens next. So the way out is yet to be found. Morrison rejects the strategy of herd immunity – the idea the country could be resistant after the infection reached perhaps 60 per cent of the population – and Health Minister Greg Hunt aims to keep infections well below 2.9 million people (the implied figure in the most benign published scenario). But they also know that suppressing the virus for too long will drag out the economic damage. A point comes where too many restrictions will work against the country as a whole, and where calculations are made about the cost of saving lives. The medical experts are grappling with this challenge. “There is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm,” wrote Tony Blakely, a University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology (but not one of the Doherty Institute team) for The Conversation this week. “Lockdowns, for example, cause drops in GDP and increases in unemployment. That feeds back on to changes in suicide and heart disease. We need to quantify that, and weigh it up.” This will be the next phase in the debate. With more modelling about the shutdowns, rather than the virus alone, the argument will shift towards easing the constraints. Inside the Morrison government, one of the worries is that the economic damage could kill more people than the virus. The solution is to relax the restrictions in stages and in different locations. Morrison may want this but cannot dictate the terms. The states and territories will make their own decisions because each has a different case load. It is tempting but misguided to debate a simple calculation – how many lives are worth sacrificing at the altar of the economy? – but the fact is that most of the cost cannot be avoided. The world economy is in shock. Australia cannot stop the slump. Even so, nobody should be naive about the decisions political leaders and their governments must make in this crisis. They have rejected herd immunity but they have not promised eradication; their objective is to manage the deaths without overloading the hospitals. If the scientists are right, the recovery will not run as the politicians wish. While the Parliament’s new law stops the wage subsidies on the last Sunday in September, the virus is a law unto itself. Even if the government halts the JobKeeper payment of $1500 a fortnight, can it really halve the JobSeeker payment of $1100 a fortnight – that is, return to the old Newstart rate – six months from now? Replay   It seems unlikely. It would require Morrison to put jobless Australians back on the old subsistence rate when independent economist Saul Eslake forecasts the ranks of the unemployed will double to almost 1.4 million. The recovery will not be swift enough to make that decision easy. Restaurants may reopen one day but the borders will remain closed. It will be Fortress Australia all this year and beyond. That is why “sovereignty” was Morrison’s key word in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday. Can Australia grow at all when it is locked off from the world? That may be the experiment until a vaccine arrives. McVernon and McCaw are trying to prepare Australians for a lasting change. McCaw cites the Spanish influenza of a century ago as a warning. That epidemic arrived in three waves over nine months but did not stop there. “For the next five or six years there were elevated levels of disease activity from that same virus as it settled down and became a part of our ecosystem,” he says. “And then it was there for decades afterwards.” It is an ugly ecosystem.

""We are faced with an unprecedented situation and our focus is firmly on keeping people in jobs and businesses in business,"" he said. ""At a time when lots of people are doing it tough pay rises are not top of my list."" The Berejiklian government has been developing a range of measures to help healthcare workers, including free accommodation to give doctors, nurses, paramedics and other hospital and ambulance staff the option of staying in out-of-home accommodation during the pandemic. Local health districts will work with staff to make sure accommodation is close to work or their families, depending on individual needs. The government will spend almost $60 million on the free accommodation as well as $25 million in funding for medical research and vaccine trials to help develop a cure to beat COVID-19. Replay   The funding is on top of $700 million set aside to boost the health budget, which includes almost doubling the number of intensive care beds in the state's hospitals. The government has been working to significantly boost capacity in ICU since the crisis hit and the bed numbers have risen from 537 to 1020 in eight weeks. There are also plans for bed numbers to quadruple as the state prepares for severe coronavirus cases. Mr Perrottet is also finalising plans for residential rent relief, which is likely to include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on savings to tenants. It is expected details of the plan will be outlined within days as landlords report tenants are implementing rent strikes. Any measures will focus on people who have been financially impacted by the health crisis. The Treasurer is also working on a package to help commercial and retail tenants stay afloat, which is likely to include rent freezes for commercial tenants and loan repayment holidays for landlords.

The officer stressed that a major concern was exposing Border Force employees to possible coronavirus, prompting the harbourmaster to offer to stop the ship at Bradley's Head.

The Sydney Morning Herald has confirmed he was shopping at Westfield Eastgardens shopping centre in Sydney’s south-east on March 22 - about 20 mins drive from his Sydney home in Elizabeth Bay.

He rushed back to Sydney on Wednesday night after he was photographed at the coastal home, undermining Premier Gladys Berejiklian's message that people must not travel over the Easter long weekend.

31,/politics/nsw/nsw-finalising-tenancy-relief-as-residential-rents-likely-to-drop-20200408-p54idb.html,NSW finalising tenancy relief as residential rents likely to drop,"The Berejiklian government's plans for residential rent relief will include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on the savings to tenants. NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the states had been working on ideas for rent relief following this week's national cabinet meeting. NSW is finalising residential rent relief as tenants are hit by the financial impact of the coronavirus. Credit:Jim Rice “Offering a degree of land tax waiver or deferral for landlords is something we are finalising,"" Mr Perrottet said. But Mr Perrottet urged tenants to keep paying rent. The government is keen to ensure relief measures only apply to people whose finances have been hit by the coronavirus crisis. ""Obviously many people are worried about keeping a roof over their head, but I don't believe something like a rent strike will ultimately help either party,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This is a complicated area and both sides face challenges, and I urge landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions at this extremely difficult time."" Rents are expected to drop in coming months, experts say, as a surge in rental properties combines with a drop in tenant demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19. The number of rentals hitting the Sydney market over the past three weeks was up 18 per cent year-on-year, according to Domain figures. A return of short-term holiday rentals to the longer-term market, a change in tenant circumstances and a drop off in migration are all behind the jump, according to Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell. ""The big question is if this is going to continue. If it does, we will see downward pressure on rents,"" Dr Powell said. Median Sydney asking rents rebounded over the first quarter — after reaching their lowest levels in years — according to the latest Domain Rent Report, but the turnaround could be over before it's truly begun. Median rents rose 1 per cent for houses to $530 a week, and 2 per cent for units to $520 a week, off the back of a fall in unit completions at a time of steady population growth, Dr Powell said. House rents are still $20 lower and unit rents $30 lower than the 2017-18 peak. ""Sydney house rents rose for the first time in three years and unit rents rose for the first time in two years ... [but] this trend is expected to be short-lived,"" Dr Powell said. Meanwhile, Sydney's vacancy rate rose 20 basis points in March to 2.7 per cent, after trending down since mid-2019. There were an estimated 14,528 vacant rentals at the end of the month – 845 more than the previous month, with some landlords already slashing rents by hundreds of dollars a week to attract tenants. Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty. While the federal government has put a moratorium on rental evictions for six months, it has left the provision of further rental assistance to states and territories. For now tenants are required to negotiate rent relief with their property manager or landlord – with mixed results. Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, expected vacancy rates to rise sharply over the short term and said asking rents were already starting to fall. ""At one stage Sydney was recording annual rent declines of 5 per cent, and then towards the end of last year rents started to stabilise; it's very possible we could see yet another 5 per cent decline but we don't know yet, we need to see the fallout first,"" he said. Mr Christopher said vacancy rates would also be impacted by the number of new homes being completed. While completions are on the decline, an expected pull back in buyer and tenant demand could lead to an oversupply of new homes. He added rental markets in Sydney and Melbourne, which take the lion's share of net migration from overseas, were likely to take the biggest hit. Maria Carlino, the national head of property management at The Agency, has seen the number of rental listings across the eastern seaboard jump about 30 per cent in recent weeks. At the same time, property inquiries from potential tenants have dropped about 35 per cent and days on market have increased. The increase in available rentals was giving tenants more choice and opportunity to negotiate, Ms Carlino said. Meanwhile, The Agency is also working through hundreds of requests for help, with tenants across 15 per cent of its Sydney portfolio seeking some form of rent relief. Ms Carlino said most landlords were understanding of tenants in genuine need of assistance, but many were awaiting further government announcements.

Sources with knowledge of official inquiries into the debacle revealed a conversation took place with the Port Authority of NSW employee and a Border Force officer in the hours before the ship was due to dock. The Ruby Princess cruise ship at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Circular Quay, Sydney.Credit:Kate Geraghty The officer expressed concern about passengers disembarking after being made aware that as many as 140 passengers aboard were in isolation due to health concerns. So serious were the concerns flagged, the harbourmaster offered to stop the ship at Bradley’s Head to prevent it docking at Sydney Harbour. According to the sources, the harbourmaster was told by the Border Force officer that they needed to check with a supervisor and 15 minutes later, the officer called back and said the ship could dock. The crucial development is understood to be a key part of a NSW Police criminal investigation examining the fiasco. There are as many as 650 passengers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and there have been 15 deaths. The sources said authorities would almost certainly examine who the Border Force official spoke to and why the decision not to leave the ship at Bradley’s Head was made. Border Force confirmed the telephone conversation between its officer and a ports authority employee in the early hours of March 19. ""The ABF officer made internal enquiries and subsequently advised the NSW Port Authority that the vessel had been cleared by NSW Health,"" a statement from Border force said. ""The ABF did not seek to shape or influence any view or decision by the NSW Port Authority."" NSW's total confirmed cases of COVID-19 stands at 2734, an increase of 49 cases on the previous day. There are 227 people being treated by NSW Health, including 36 patients in intensive care and 22 on ventilators. Premier Gladys Berejiklian told her MPs in a recent party room meeting that Border Force had wrongly told NSW Health that the cruise ship was deemed ""low-risk"" before it docked on March 19. Almost 2700 passengers were allowed to disembark in the early hours of March 19, with four cases of coronavirus confirmed hours later. An MP who was in the party room said Ms Berejiklian ""made it very clear that we did not fail, we were not responsible"". ""She was very defiant. We were absolutely not to blame,"" the MP said. But her comments prompted the Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram to hit back. ""What broke down in this case was ... health officers, trained doctors or nurses didn't get on board the vessel, swab passengers and take their swabs for results,"" Mr Outram said on March 25. He said his officers were responsible for ensuring there was no contraband and ensuring everyone had visas. The Department of Agriculture had the biosecurity responsibility, Mr Outram said. Replay   NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller revealed on Sunday there would be a criminal investigation, led by homicide detectives, and a likely coronial inquiry. Mr Fuller said an investigation was critical to determine whether the operators of the ship, Carnival Australia, were ""transparent"" about ill passengers. He also singled out the Ports Authority as doing an ""exceptional job"" after phone logs between the the authority and Carnival Australia suggested the ship downplayed the risk of COVID-19. The logs show the Ports Authority had initially not allowed the ship to dock because of coronavirus fears but then overturned that decision after being led to believe that there was no virus threat. On Wednesday, 30 detectives from State Crime, Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics and Marine Area commands were seconded to the criminal investigation dubbed Strike Force Bast. Investigators will interview ""high-priority witnesses"" this week and are urging passengers with relevant information to contact Crime Stoppers.

The government will also announce on Friday that disused aged care centres owned by the state will be repurposed so they can house homeless people who contract the coronavirus or need to self-isolate because of it. The funding will help provide accommodation for those escaping family violence during the coronavirus crisis.Credit:Shutterstock The $40 million family violence funding package will be made available for those who have experienced violence or who feel unsafe isolating or recovering from coronavirus in their home. Further measures and funding are also expected to be announced on Friday by the Andrews government to provide critical help for survivors of family violence. The government is also spending $8.8 million preparing four ""pop-up"" facilities to provide healthcare and accommodation for more than 200 homeless people across Melbourne. One homeless services provider said they were not aware of any rough sleepers in inner Melbourne who had contracted the virus. The government is concerned over both an outbreak among some of Melbourne’s most vulnerable people, and homeless people potentially spreading the virus. Replay   Since announcing an earlier round of funding from the state in March to tackle homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic, 529 rough sleepers across the state have found temporary homes – including 150 in Melbourne's city centre.

Housing Minister Richard Wynne said the accommodation for homeless people affected by coronavirus would be operated by Anglicare, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria. St Vincent’s Hospital will provide health services in all of the former aged care centres. Homeless people who want to access the former aged care centres will need to have undergone testing for coronavirus and be awaiting results, or have been confirmed as having the virus. They will also be able to access a centre if they are required to self-isolate and do not have suitable housing, or have been discharged from hospital and are recovering from coronavirus. Mr Wynne said those without a home were at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they could not self-isolate or quarantine. “This will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus.” The Council to Homeless Persons welcomed the funding, with chief executive Jenny Smith saying those without a home were incredibly vulnerable. “The overwhelming advice during this pandemic has been to stay at home to prevent spreading the virus.

Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said the seven High Court judges who acquitted the cardinal on Tuesday had in effect ""expressed no confidence"" in the state's justice system, and that all the officials involved in convicting him owed the public an explanation. Cardinal George Pell arriving at the Seminary of the Good Shepherd in Sydney on Wednesday.Credit:AAP ""The High Court has stepped in to say Victoria's legal system's got a fundamental problem – they're getting it too wrong for too long, and the public has got to ask questions about how we can continue to have confidence in Victoria's legal system,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""Instead the Police Minister and the Premier say 'nothing to see here'. They think it's OK to sweep all this under the carpet – well, justice is too important to be swept under the carpet in this state."" Australia's seven most senior judges unanimously ruled that Cardinal Pell's convictions for historical child sex abuse be quashed, ruling there was a ""significant possibility"" that an innocent person had been convicted. Cardinal Pell, 78, spent more than 400 days in jail after a County Court jury found him guilty in 2018 on five charges related to allegations he sexually abused two choirboys in 1996 and 1997 at St Patrick's Cathedral in East Melbourne. In 2019 the jury verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a majority 2-1 ruling. But the High Court disagreed. ""The jury, acting rationally on the whole of the evidence, ought to have entertained a doubt as to the applicant's guilt with respect to each of the offences for which he was convicted,"" the judges said. Premier Daniel Andrews defended Victoria’s courts on Wednesday. “I think that [County Court Chief Judge] Peter Kidd has done his job very well and I think that the justice system has worked,” the Premier said. Replay   “I'm not making a value judgment on the case but there are court processes and they can ultimately end in the highest court in the land hearing an appeal and deciding one way or the other."" Mr O'Brien stopped short of calling for an inquiry or royal commission into the justice system but said public confidence in Victoria Police and the Office of Public Prosecutions was ""severely lacking"". ""The police, prosecutors and judges all have questions to answer as a result of this,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""What I'd like to see, certainly from police and prosecutors that they explain themselves ... They owe it to the community to explain themselves and explain the decisions and how it got as far as it did, given what the High Court has unanimously found. Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien says Victoria's justice system needs to explain the decisions that led to Cardinal George Pell's conviction. Credit:Luis Enrique Ascui ""If they want to maintain public confidence in their ability to do their role in this legal system they are under an obligation to explain themselves in order to maintain public confidence because I can tell you now that public confidence is severely lacking."" The Opposition Leader said many people, including both the complainant – known as ""Witness J"" – and the cardinal, suffered ""unnecessary pain"" over a case that should have not gone as far as it had, questioning how the checks and balances in Victoria's legal system could have failed. Victoria Police said it respected the decision of the High Court, and remained committed to investigating sexual offences. ""We would also like to acknowledge the thorough work on this case by Taskforce Sano investigators over many years,"" it said in a statement. The Court of Appeal and the Office of Public Prosecutions both declined to comment.

38,/politics/victoria/the-cough-that-crossed-the-globe-andrew-abercrombie-s-ill-fated-party-20200403-p54gp9.html,The cough that crossed the globe: Andrew Abercrombie's ill-fated party,"Someone coughed at a high-society party in the US resort of Aspen and wealthy Victorians from Toorak to the Mornington Peninsula were infected with COVID-19. Melbourne businessman and Liberal Party powerbroker Andrew Abercrombie hosted the two-hour cocktail party at his luxury chalet that unwittingly compounded a public health crisis. Abercrombie is best known for his vast wealth and abiding devotion to the Liberal Party, which has not always been reciprocated. The 63-year-old multimillionaire lost to Kelly O'Dwyer in the Higgins preselection contest in 2009, despite hosting a tribute dinner for Peter Costello at his Toorak mansion months earlier. Andrew Abercrombie. Illustration: John ShakespeareCredit:  His role as treasurer of the Victorian Liberal Party ended in acrimony in 2015 when former state director Damien Mantach was caught embezzling $1.55 million in campaign funds. Mantach was sentenced to five years in jail, while Abercrombie resigned from his post amid scathing criticism of his oversight of the party's coffers which prompted sweeping reforms by party president Michael Kroger. Undeterred, he continued to raise funds, including a $10,000-a-head “special dinner” for Prime Minister Scott Morrison last year. In 2016, just days after another fundraising event for the Turnbull government, Abercrombie's faux chateau on St Georges Road in Toorak was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewellery. Less than a week after the heist, thieves broke into another property owned by Abercrombie on Portsea's clifftop. The culprits were never apprehended and the jewels never found. Not one to court the media, Abercrombie is rarely named in the press, other than his annual mention in the BRW rich list, which recently estimated his fortune at $512 million. Andrew Abercrombie's faux chateau on St Georges Road, Toorak. Abercrombie and wife Shadda, who is often referred to as Sharon Leigh Abercrombie in company documents, also own a $6.9 million apartment overlooking Noosa's Laguna Bay and another historic Toorak mansion on St Georges Road known as Edzell House. A generous benefactor to La Trobe University and director of the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Abercrombie was also a strident defender of News Limited columnist Andrew Bolt in 2011, when he was found to have breached the Racial Discrimination Act during a Federal Court trial. Abercrombie was a lawyer for the entertainment industry in the 1980s, until at 30 he packed his bags to study for an MBA in Switzerland before working on Wall Street. Upon his return to Melbourne, he established a financial services business called Flexirent in 1990. A disappointed Abercrombie and wife Shadda after his failure to win preselection for Higgins in 2009. Credit:John Woudstra With a presence in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, the company now known as Flexigroup enables customers to purchase items from white goods to groceries by paying for them in instalments. The service is essentially a digital version of the traditional ""layby"" sale, but with the customer receiving the goods immediately. Abercrombie was the company's chief executive until 2003 and it listed on the ASX in 2006. He became chairman in 2015 but has always retained a significant stake in the business - at times upwards of 25 per cent. Like most listed companies, Flexigroup's share price has been battered by the collapse of global financial markets following the outbreak of COVID-19. But the buy now, pay later sector has been particularly hard hit, amid fears that a sharp rise in unemployment could trigger a mass default. At the time Abercrombie was toasting his guests in Aspen on March 2, Flexigroup shares were trading at $1.65. But over the past month, the stock price has plummeted to about 70 cents, punching a significant hole in his fortune. Not much, other than bunker down to avoid the maelstrom. The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald revealed a week ago that several guests from the soiree at Abercrombie's apartment in the luxurious North of Nell chalet had refused to self-isolate. As almost a dozen guests returned positive results, one couple refused to be tested in Aspen, unable to resist the perfect skiing conditions. A picturesque street in the Colorado holiday town of Vail.Credit:Ruth Ritchie Another couple with symptoms fled to the neighbouring resort of Vail, where they stayed with a friend from Melbourne, who would also become infected. She returned to Australia on March 13 and, having no symptoms and following the health advice at the time, attended a 21st birthday party in Malvern on March 14 where six people would become infected. One of the people infected at the party would then board a plane to Sydney on March 16. Upon their return to Melbourne, another infected couple attended an event for parents at Geelong Grammar's Toorak campus on March 6 before heading down to Portsea, where they allegedly played golf and shopped in Sorrento. Abercrombie has complied with all government directives, according to his spokesman. “Mr Abercrombie is in good health and has been in self-isolation in Melbourne since returning home from Aspen,"" the spokesman said. ""He has twice tested negative for COVID-19 and yesterday [March 26] received a notice from VicHealth confirming his isolation period is over. He has not been to Portsea since leaving for overseas in mid-February,"" his spokesman said. His spokesman did not comment on the conduct of his guests in Aspen. The Prime Minister announced on March 15 that all travellers arriving in Australia would soon be compelled to self-isolate for 14 days and those who tested positive required approval from state health departments before they could be released from quarantine. Premiers in Victoria and NSW have ramped up enforcement action, including massive fines, in a rearguard bid to contain the spread of the pandemic. But how can ordinary folk be expected to follow a government decree when some of the nation's most affluent figures continue to play golf and go shopping? Feelings running high: a sign recently posted on the Mornington Peninsula. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt weighed into the debate this week, branding the behaviour a ""disgrace"". ""Some people think that the laws and, even more importantly, the notion of socially responsible behaviour does not apply to them,"" Hunt said on Tuesday. The infection clusters in Australia's most advantaged suburbs have shown that COVID-19 has no regard for privilege. Stonnington, which includes the wealthy suburbs of Toorak, Malvern and South Yarra, has 82 infections - the most of any Victorian municipality to this point. Boroondara comes second, with suburbs such as Hawthorn, Canterbury and Camberwell recording 52 positive tests. Mornington Peninsula, which includes Portsea and Sorrento, recorded the fourth-highest infection rate in Victoria with 49 cases. Replay   The issue has been incredibly divisive on the peninsula, where many well-heeled Melburnians, including several members of the Aspen crowd, have sought refuge. Permanent residents, many of them elderly people from working-class suburbs such as Rosebud and Rye, are incensed about the disproportionate rate of infection and the impact it will have on their already overburdened hospital. Visitors heading to Portsea are now confronted with a blunt message at a roundabout on Melbourne Road and Canterbury Jetty Road. ""COVID 19 ain't no holiday. Go home. Locals only.""

""We have had a number of people parking in bus stops and the buses cannot stop. ""So please think of others when you are parking. ""We don’t want to be issuing any fines, but if there is someone who is parking in a place that prevents public transport from operating then we will have to review some of those circumstances."" Brisbane City Council announced on March 26 all street parking would be free as the city struggled to recover from coronavirus. Meanwhile, Brisbane residents might get the road outside their home resurfaced in a hurry as the council looks for innovative ways to help the city. The council will ask the federal government to accelerate $350 million in new government projects to keep Brisbane construction and roadworks afloat. Cr Schrinner said 48 ""large and small"" projects have been put to the federal government for funding since the federal election. ""We specifically identified projects which we can get started quickly and can be geared up quickly as part of the economic stimulus program,"" he said. On Tuesday, Cr Schrinner announced a new economic recovery taskforce with the council’s finance and administration committee to oversee Brisbane’s economic recovery. It will be chaired by Cr Adam Allan, who worked in banking and finance consultancy before his election to council in 2016.

The $25 million project to replace the Indooroopilly roundabout on Moggill Road might also come forward, Cr Schrinner said.

""That was an election commitment, so we will be getting on with that project as quickly as possible."" The federal government will be asked to bring forward Financial Assistance Grants, which provide councils with much-needed funding for local infrastructure. Cr Allan said he would ask the National Retailers Association, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Restaurant and Catering Association of Australia for suggestions to assist businesses. ""Each sector has its own nuances. If you look at an industry such as the retail industry there might some specific measures we can take to help support those businesses and to promote those business once we are through the worst of the response to the virus.""

Queensland’s Year 12 students, who were set to sit a public exam this October and November, might have those exams delayed until December. Public high school exams could be pushed back to December.Credit:Craig Abraham All Australian education ministers meet on Tuesday to discuss the way forward for Year 12 students, whose final year of secondary school has been interrupted by coronavirus. Queensland joined the national ATAR scheme in 2020, after state authorities dropped the Overall Position (OP) system. Year 12s now have to sit a public exam during a three-week block from October 26 to November 17. These exams could be delayed until December, Mr Tehan said on Monday. Minister for Education Dan Tehan said there had already been discussions with Australian universities.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen All options were being discussed so there was no interruption to the students as they strove to enter university and TAFE courses, the minister said. “Instead of [exams] normally being in November, push them back into December. These will be all the things that we’ll be looking at and working through tomorrow,” he said. One option would involve Year 12 students completing short courses at university before they began their formal first-year studies. “All universities have the ability to put short courses in place, which will enable students to catch up in areas where they mightn’t have been able to get that knowledge that they will require for a course like medicine, for example,” Mr Tehan said. “So, we’ve got the ability to look at all these things, be flexible, be innovative, and just say to students, ‘Look, you might be required to do this eight-week short course at the start of your medicine degree, so that you get that knowledge’.” Mr Tehan said there had already been discussions with Australian universities. “They’d be happy to look at a mix of what’s happened during the student’s assessments in Year 11, and then look at what’s happened in Year 12, and look at a mixture then of both,” he said. Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace said state's curriculum advice body, the Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority, on March 26 removed one assessment piece from each subject in Year 12. Principals were advised of the reduction in assignments in late March. “This means that final subject results in general subjects will be calculated from two internal assessments and one external assessment,” QCAA chair Brian Short said. “In Essential English and Essential Mathematics, it will be two internal assessments and a common internal assessment developed by the QCAA. “In all other Applied subjects, it will be three internal assessments.” Ms Grace said schools were making decisions to minimise the disadvantage for 2020’s students studying to attain a Queensland Certificate of Education. “The QCAA has removed one internal assessment from the total of four prescribed in each syllabus to provide some relief for students during this time,” Ms Grace said. “More than 98 per cent of schools have already uploaded completed internal assessments, meaning that for most students they will only be required to complete one further internal assessment this year,” she said. “We will continue to work collaboratively to adapt our learning resources as this unprecedented pandemic evolves.” Year12 students still have to complete the public examination, which is worth 50 per cent of their curriculum testing for maths and science. It makes up 25 per cent of the grade in other subjects.   Tony Moore is a senior reporter at the Brisbane Times Copyright © 2020", Tony Moore ,"April 6, 2020"

The call came as Treasurer Ben Wyatt said the part of the state economy which relied on household consumption had ""effectively stalled"" in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

""We should follow what Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania have done and provide some low interest loans to small businesses to help them with cash flow for the next six months,"" she said. ""A lot of small business owners I'm talking to are saying if we could just get some cash flow to help pay the wages and tick things along until things return to normal, it'll be the difference between us closing our doors forever or being here in six months."" The opposition is also pushing for the government to provide more financial support for seniors, increase hardship payments and grant a payroll tax holiday for small businesses. Replay   On Monday Premier Mark McGowan announced a freeze on increases to household fees and charges, a doubling of the energy assistance payment for low income earners, the fast-tracking of payroll tax cuts by six months, and the deferral of payroll tax payments for businesses impacted by coronavirus. Talking to Gareth Parker on 6PR's Mornings, Mr Wyatt said the public reaction to the crisis would cause a contraction in the 40 per cent of the economy driven by consumer spending. ""What we're seeing, the data is still emerging, but that household consumption component of our economy, that's 40 per cent of our economy, that has except really for grocery chains, I suspect we'll see that as effectively stalled,"" he said. ""To give you some point of comparison, while household consumption is 40 per cent of the economy, government expenditure is about 14 or 15 per cent. ""So you can see we're in a scenario where the big engine room of our economy has been hit quite dramatically."" The Treasurer said there was no doubt businesses and jobs would be impacted. ""My view is that this June quarter and the September quarter are likely to see the biggest impacts and hopefully once we're through that September quarter we start to see, if you like, a normalisation of behaviour again,"" he said. ""At the moment, we're very much in that assistance and response stage, but we also need to start preparing ourselves for the recovery stage as well. ""I don't want to find ourselves on the other side of this with no balance sheet capacity to also then have a recovery package as well."" The real estate industry called on the state government this morning to consider rent assistance for residential tenants who lose their jobs and safeguards for landlords if tenants can't pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic. REIWA president Damian Collins said: ""At the end of the day, if the owner cannot afford their mortgage, the tenant will end up homeless regardless, so all participants need to be considered in any package or changes"".
