Serpentine National Park in Perth's southeast will close between 8am on Saturday and 8am on Sunday. In Toodyay, the Avon Valley National Park will remain closed from today until Saturday. Both reserves are popular hiking spots for their proximity to Perth.  People are urged to avoid the area, follow the advice of Parks and Wildlife Service staff and observe signage. Those who are already in the area should leave for a safer place.  For more information go to the Emergency WA website or call the local Parks and Wildlife office on 9290 6100. News updates will also be shared on Facebook, Twitter and ABC radio.  Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services were designed for, with the former emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online and the latter optimised for business meetings.

Health officials are expected to visit two quarantine hotels in Perth after claims security guards were instructed to remove personal protection face masks because they were “upsetting and intimidating” guests. CBD hotels the Duxton and Pan Pacific are being used to isolate hundreds of interstate and overseas travellers for a mandatory 14-day period to help manage the spread of COVID-19. Serco was given responsibility to provide security at the Duxton but contracted the work to Perth-based Corporate Security Australia. Health Minister Roger Cook said the WA government expected all contractors to ensure their workers were suitably protected.

United Workers Union state secretary Carolyn Smith said dozens of security guards at the Duxton and Pan Pacific were now at greater risk after site supervisors instructed them to remove masks for the sake of quarantined hotel guests. “We’ve seen incidents with people trying to leave the quarantine … and what stands between that happening and threatening the WA population is our workers,” she said. Approximately 10 security guards work 12-hour shifts on each floor housing guests subject to forced government quarantine, hotel cleaners are also regularly operating in those areas. “Being handed a mask and then having that mask taken away when working in a high-risk environment is unacceptable and reckless in the current health crisis,” Ms Smith said. “These hotels are housing people at risk of coronavirus. These security guards do have contact with guests, they are working at lifts, in hallways and lobbies. “We don’t believe for a minute that guests in a hotel under quarantine would be intimidated by PPE, and would want to be seeing all workers taking precautions.” Masks, gloves and hand sanitiser were issued to guards by Corporate Security at the beginning of shifts but site supervisors soon told them to remove them because they would “upset and intimidate the guests staying there”, the union said. “One of our members was so concerned at the directive and the health and safety implications that she resigned her position,” Ms Smith said. Perth Airport has closed Terminal 1 Domestic Pier to the general public until further notice after Virgin Australia moved to temporarily suspend interstate flights this week.  Virgin announced on Thursday they would be suspending all of their domestic flights from Friday, except a return service between Sydney and Melbourne running daily except Saturdays. Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the current health crisis. The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked the government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Announcing the news on social media, Perth Airport said Virgin's regional flights departing from Terminal 2 to transport FIFO workers would not be impacted. Beaches along the Perth coast are already packed as police warn people who flock to the coast on a scorching Good Friday to follow strict social distancing measures. Two police helicopters were watching beachgoers closely every five minutes.

Beaches in Sorrento and Hillarys were packed by 10am on Friday.Credit:David Prestipino Carparks at Hillarys Boat Harbour and Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club were already full while a flurry of cyclists, runners and walkers flooded the pedestrian footpath on West Coast Drive. The government has so far stopped short of closing popular swimming spots to combat COVID-19 but police on Friday warned beachgoers they risked being charged or forcing authorities to close beaches if distancing guidelines weren't adhered to. Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel told 6PR's Mornings with Gareth Parker beaches would be closed if people did not comply with the measures ahead of two days forecast to reach the high 30s. ""If people do the right thing then there'll be no need to do that ... that might be a step we've got to go to if people do break the rules,"" he said. ""If you don't stop movement, we can't slow the spread... so before you decide to head down to the beach or undertake activity, our advice to people is to stay at home, and stay safe if you can."" Police will monitor activity along the coast and other gathering hot spots over the Easter long weekend and crack down on those flouting the rules. ""We have a number of police targeting those areas over the weekend; beaches, carparks, parks and other locations where people traditionally gather over Easter,"" he said. ""Police monitoring won't be punitive, it will be measured... but people who blatantly disregard the law, who blatantly disregard the good work the community is doing, could be charged. ""By all means go for a swim, go for a surf, go for a run, but you don't need to be down there all day."" The warning comes after several councils along Perth’s coastline urged beachgoers to “keep their distance”, with some even closing access to popular beaches. The City of Mandurah last Tuesday announced they would restrict vehicle access to White Hills and Tims Thicket, two popular fishing spots, to “stop the spread of COVID-19”. Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt also encouraged locals to go for a swim or a walk so long as they stayed at least 1.5 metres from others. “When you’re done with your swim, run or walk, don’t linger – go home,” he said. WA Premier Mark McGowan has issued a heartfelt message thanking all  West Australians working over the long Easter weekend and asking families to ""spare a thought"" for those on duty.  ""There’s going to be West Australians keeping shelves stocked and keeping us alive in ICUs,"" he said. ""There’s going to be West Australians at border checkpoints and looking after the people in isolation facilities across the state. ""Responding to emergencies, dishing up takeaway, on our wharves, driving trucks, on a mine site, working in aged care. Not to mention keeping our workplaces clean and disinfected. ""All over this great state, West Australians will be keeping things running, and holding this pandemic at bay. ""To them, we say thank you.""   If you're just catching up on news late this morning, here are the most recent updates from overseas: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning the UN Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security, ""potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease."" China on Friday reported 42 new cases, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. California saw its first daily decrease in intensive care hospitalisations during the coronavirus outbreak, a key indicator of how many health care workers and medical supplies the state needs, Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday (US time). As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city's public cemetery. Italy has banned foreign-flagged migrant rescue ships from docking in its ports because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Malta has said it can no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency. The British government's two chief advisers on the coronavirus pandemic voiced cautious optimism that the country's outbreak may be near its peak even as the COVID-19 death toll rose sharply to just shy of 8000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care. Germany's national disease control centre says it plans to conduct a series of blood tests to determine how many people in the country are immune to COVID-19 and how many were infected without knowing it. Iran's supreme leader suggested Thursday that mass gatherings may be barred through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it believes at least 35 Iranian prisoners were killed by security forces suppressing riots by inmates over the virus.

AAP NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed one person in NSW, who is critically ill with coronavirus, is on ECMO. Here's a lay person description of how ECMO works: extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) takes over a patient's lung or heart function, reoxygenating their blood and removing carbon dioxide externally. Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. The state’s healthcare workers will now get free parking at hospitals in a bid to ease the pressure on those working on the COVID-19 frontline. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said all staff rostered to work at hospitals, including cleaners, security staff, allied health workers as well as nurses and doctors, will have access to the free parking from today. “It is critical that our frontline workers are able to access their place of work as easily as possible and we are taking these measures to ensure that is the case,” he said. Mr Hazzard said local councils were also working to help improve parking near health facilities. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was doing “whatever we can” to support hospital staff. “We hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.” Maureen Jacotine 86 year old resident of Uniting's Aldersgate aged care facility began crying while speaking with her family via Zoom.

More than 60,000 Australians a day are not turning up for their routine pathology tests, as restrictions on movement, fear of coronavirus and a misperception that services are overwhelmed keep them away. Pathologists have reported a 40 per cent drop in the number of routine tests performed in recent weeks for conditions including cancer, diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, according to the Royal College of Pathologists Australasia. If these tests are skipped, their condition could deteriorate to the point that they need to be hospitalised, the college warned. GP  Allison Bielawski giving a flu shot to patient Lily Bardsley 24, at her practice in Glebe. Credit:James Brickwood Dr Debra Graves, CEO of the college said there was an assumption that routine tests and medical appointments were not happening because of health services being busy with COVID-19, or that it was not safe to go for a test when you need one. “We want to reassure Australians that pathology is still here providing the tests that you need every day. Your health is our priority,” Dr Graves said. Earlier this week Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy urged Australians not to ignore any other health issues they have during the coronavirus pandemic, saying some general practitioners are raising alarms over a sudden drop in patients and “a lot of people with chronic diseases” were not going to their check-ups. ""They're very worried that people are so frightened that they're not seeking medical attention,"" Professor Murphy said. “This is a very concerning issue … please don’t neglect general health conditions at the moment. That is a really important message."" Dr Graves also urged anyone with a chronic condition who needs regular pathology tests or anyone worried about symptoms they have developed to contact their GP and arrange a telehealth consultation if they can’t get to an appointment. ""We know that measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 will continue for some months and people need to continue looking after their health during this time,"" Dr Graves said. She said COVID-19 testing samples are generally only performed in designated locations, either at a dedicated site or a location separated from general pathology collection. “Pathology providers are experts in detecting infectious diseases ... This includes collection centres where strict hygiene, appropriate distancing and separation measures are in place,” Dr Graves said. Police have handed out almost 50 fines of $1000 for breaching social distancing restrictions in the last 24 hours, and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said any breaches of the rules will not be tolerated. “These people need to be sent a very clear message that it won't be tolerated, it won't be tolerated by the police or the community,” he said.“If you choose to go against what most people in the community think is a reasonable consideration with the situation that we're faced with COVID-19, police will take action.” Police last week speaking to a man who refused to leave Bondi Beach..Credit:Edwina Pickles From today, NSW Police are also able to issue a $5000 on-the-spot fine for spitting or coughing on health workers or police officers. “I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. He said the fine was unprecedented, but “it reflects the community disgust”. “It is absolutely disgusting to think that anybody would think it's OK to cough or spit on a police officer or a health worker at any time, let alone in the world's worst virus crisis for a hundred years,” Mr Hazzard said. “So, $5000, you should be very lucky, you're getting off lightly.” Mr Worboys gave a “big thank you” to people staying at home this Easter. But he added police would be out in force this long weekend, keeping their eyes peeled for people travelling away from home. “Right across country NSW, and, indeed, in and around the urban area here, police have been vigilant around people towing caravans, people with trailers and quad bikes and camping gear, people with surfboards,” he said. Mr Worboys said police near border towns were also on the lookout for vehicles with Queensland and Victorian licence plates “moving into the state for holiday activities”. “If you don’t have an excuse to travel you will be issued with a $1000 fine,” he said. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed a 69-year-old man has died at John Hunter Hospital in NSW overnight, raising the national coronavirus death toll to 53. One of NSW’s critically ill coronavirus patients is on ECMO, Mr Hazzard said. “ECMO, of course, is a higher level of need for the patient, extra corporeal oxygenation, making sure your organs are being oxygenated,” he said. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state has seen a “very modest” increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was “fantastic” the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday.

The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. The terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. ""The aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,"" she said in a statement. ""We will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time."" AAP NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed one person in NSW, who is critically ill with coronavirus, is on ECMO. Here's a lay person description of how ECMO works: extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) takes over a patient's lung or heart function, reoxygenating their blood and removing carbon dioxide externally. Large tubes are attached to two major arteries, forming a continuous loop as blood drains from one cannula, through the ECMO core, and returns oxygenated blood to the body through the other. The state’s healthcare workers will now get free parking at hospitals in a bid to ease the pressure on those working on the COVID-19 frontline. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said all staff rostered to work at hospitals, including cleaners, security staff, allied health workers as well as nurses and doctors, will have access to the free parking from today. “It is critical that our frontline workers are able to access their place of work as easily as possible and we are taking these measures to ensure that is the case,” he said. Mr Hazzard said local councils were also working to help improve parking near health facilities. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was doing “whatever we can” to support hospital staff. “We hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.” Maureen Jacotine 86 year old resident of Uniting's Aldersgate aged care facility began crying while speaking with her family via Zoom. Credit:SMH Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services where designed for, with the former optimised for business meetings and the latter emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online. While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, Tim Biggs has some tips to stay safe. For Zoom: Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. For Houseparty: Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. More than 60,000 Australians a day are not turning up for their routine pathology tests, as restrictions on movement, fear of coronavirus and a misperception that services are overwhelmed keep them away. Pathologists have reported a 40 per cent drop in the number of routine tests performed in recent weeks for conditions including cancer, diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, according to the Royal College of Pathologists Australasia. If these tests are skipped, their condition could deteriorate to the point that they need to be hospitalised, the college warned.

Credit:James Brickwood Dr Debra Graves, CEO of the college said there was an assumption that routine tests and medical appointments were not happening because of health services being busy with COVID-19, or that it was not safe to go for a test when you need one. “We want to reassure Australians that pathology is still here providing the tests that you need every day. Your health is our priority,” Dr Graves said. Earlier this week Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy urged Australians not to ignore any other health issues they have during the coronavirus pandemic, saying some general practitioners are raising alarms over a sudden drop in patients and “a lot of people with chronic diseases” were not going to their check-ups. ""They're very worried that people are so frightened that they're not seeking medical attention,"" Professor Murphy said. “This is a very concerning issue … please don’t neglect general health conditions at the moment. That is a really important message."" Dr Graves also urged anyone with a chronic condition who needs regular pathology tests or anyone worried about symptoms they have developed to contact their GP and arrange a telehealth consultation if they can’t get to an appointment. ""We know that measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 will continue for some months and people need to continue looking after their health during this time,"" Dr Graves said. She said COVID-19 testing samples are generally only performed in designated locations, either at a dedicated site or a location separated from general pathology collection. “Pathology providers are experts in detecting infectious diseases ... This includes collection centres where strict hygiene, appropriate distancing and separation measures are in place,” Dr Graves said. Police have handed out almost 50 fines of $1000 for breaching social distancing restrictions in the last 24 hours, and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said any breaches of the rules will not be tolerated. “These people need to be sent a very clear message that it won't be tolerated, it won't be tolerated by the police or the community,” he said.“If you choose to go against what most people in the community think is a reasonable consideration with the situation that we're faced with COVID-19, police will take action.” Police last week speaking to a man who refused to leave Bondi Beach..Credit:Edwina Pickles From today, NSW Police are also able to issue a $5000 on-the-spot fine for spitting or coughing on health workers or police officers. “I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said. He said the fine was unprecedented, but “it reflects the community disgust”. “It is absolutely disgusting to think that anybody would think it's OK to cough or spit on a police officer or a health worker at any time, let alone in the world's worst virus crisis for a hundred years,” Mr Hazzard said. “So, $5000, you should be very lucky, you're getting off lightly.” Mr Worboys gave a “big thank you” to people staying at home this Easter. But he added police would be out in force this long weekend, keeping their eyes peeled for people travelling away from home. “Right across country NSW, and, indeed, in and around the urban area here, police have been vigilant around people towing caravans, people with trailers and quad bikes and camping gear, people with surfboards,” he said. Mr Worboys said police near border towns were also on the lookout for vehicles with Queensland and Victorian licence plates “moving into the state for holiday activities”. “If you don’t have an excuse to travel you will be issued with a $1000 fine,” he said. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed a 69-year-old man has died at John Hunter Hospital in NSW overnight, raising the national coronavirus death toll to 53. One of NSW’s critically ill coronavirus patients is on ECMO, Mr Hazzard said. “ECMO, of course, is a higher level of need for the patient, extra corporeal oxygenation, making sure your organs are being oxygenated,” he said. Twenty-nine COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units in the state, and 23 of those are on ventilators. There are 2822 confirmed cases across NSW, with 211 patients being treated in hospital. Mr Hazzard said the state has seen a “very modest” increase in COVID-19 cases, with 49 cases confirmed in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday. That’s up from the 38 cases confirmed on Wednesday. He said it was “fantastic” the number of tests has also risen, from 3906 on Wednesday to 4444 on Thursday. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys are providing an update on COVID-19.

The total number of cases includes 650 men and 591 women, ranging in age from babies to people in their early 90s. Replay   Of the 1241 cases, 1001 are in Melbourne and 229 are in the regions while several other cases remain under investigation. Thirteen people remain in intensive care and another 30 are in hospital, after seven patients were released on Thursday. The latest figures were released as the state government announced packages to help vulnerable people isolate if they are diagnosed or exposed to the virus. Prevention of Family Violence Minister Gabrielle Williams announced a $40.2 million package to support women and children. Of that total figure, $20 million will be put toward short-term housing for survivors needing somewhere safe to isolate or recover. Ms Williams said the accommodation would be similar to quarantine hotels for returned travellers and healthcare workers. The funding will go to support services, with domestic violence expected to worsen during the pandemic as families remain housebound. There has not yet been a spike in domestic violence, but it is expected to come. ""We know that that's been borne out overseas and we've got no reason to expect any different, sadly,"" Ms Williams said. There was a drop in calls for help at the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions. Experts believe that may be because survivors have less opportunity to call for help while everyone is at home. The funding includes almost $5 million for new technology and protective equipment for up to 120 family violence and sexual assault organisations, and funding for Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations. Housing Minister Richard Wynne also announced an $8.8 million homelessness package to establish four pop-up housing sites around Melbourne using repurposed aged-care homes. The accommodation can house up to 200 homeless people who are diagnosed or suspected to have coronavirus. ""We know they can't self isolate and they can't quarantine themselves,"" Mr Wynne said. St Vincent's Hospital staff will provide 24/7 healthcare at the facilities, which will be funded for six months. So far, 926 people have recovered from coronavirus, including 120 over the last 24 hours. There have been 116 cases of community transmission, with no known contact with a confirmed case or overseas travel, six more than a day ago. Victorians have been tested 62,000 times, with testing criteria widened this week for frontline workers and vulnerable people. Staff at seven hospitals and one radiology unit have been diagnosed, with 157 healthcare workers testing positive in the state so far.

Profiteering, finger pointing and fear. The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the worst in some. But look a little deeper and a far more potent story is unfolding: one of kindness, connection and trust. By Konrad Marshall Taking it to the streets … chamber musician Josephine Vains plays a social distancing “concert” for her neighbourhood in Melbourne’s Brunswick.Credit:Chris Hopkins It’s the end of the last Sunday in March, and after dipping low in the vanilla autumn sky, the sun throws all its light on MacFarland Street. A yellow glow kisses this little road in Brunswick, in Melbourne’s inner north. It dances on the puddles left by an afternoon storm. Catches the buzzing mozzies. Hits old chimneys, and iron lace balustrades, and aluminium roofs. And one musical instrument. The latter is an antique cello, made in 1830 of flamed maple and spruce, by a master craftsman from London. And it is embraced by its owner, Josephine Vains, who sits on a chair between two paperbark trees – near her parsley patch and her passionfruit creeper and her yellow recycling bin – on the footpath in front of her cream brick home. Musician Josephine Vains: “This is my way of feeling like I’m continuing to do what I always do. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.""Credit:Chris Hopkins Vains, 45, is a chamber musician who has played with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and taught at the Victorian College of the Arts. She has performed in European cathedrals of gothic splendour. Modern recital centres in the US. The ancient Longyou Caves in China. The bottom of a mine shaft in Macedon in Victoria’s Goldfields region. “Thank you for coming,” she says to her neighbours, around three dozen of whom have, on cue, left self-isolation to come together – while remaining many, many metres apart – for a little concert born on a local WhatsApp group. “I hope you enjoy the show.” They do. They might not recognise the last names of the long-dead composers on the set list, but they recognise beauty in suburbia. As Vains plays Gabrielli, a happy couple sitting on folding chairs – with teardrop wine glasses and a bottle of Margaret River cabernet sauvignon – rise to applaud. As she plays Saint-Saëns, a nuclear family crammed inside their blue Landrover Discovery are rapturous. As she plays the famous prelude from Cello Suite No. 1 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, others clap and grin from their verandahs and driveways, leaning against a front gate, or listening through an open bedroom window. “Beautiful!” yells one man, from a distance. “Thank you!” waves another. “Thanks Josie!” says her next-door neighbour. “That was the first time I’ve heard you,” adds a bloke from around the corner – an interloper from Osborne Street, two blocks down. “And I cried. It was really beautiful.” Vains smiles. All the paid performances on her calendar are cancelled due to COVID-19, but this makes that more bearable. She’s been playing a show at sunset every few days since the last week of March: a handful of songs, for this street and for herself. “This is my way of feeling … like I’m just continuing to do what I always do,” she says afterward. “I feel quite high now. It’s a natural high. And I think they feel that way, too. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.” Do we ever. It’s surreal, this silent, sequestered life we’re leading, this isolation in a coronaviral vacuum. It’s so often quiet and largely numb, yet punctuated by unwelcome sensations, isn’t it? You’ve probably felt one or two. The cold prickle of anxiety. The crack of social dislocation. For me it’s lethargy, sometimes as a sharp strain behind my eyes, but more often like a thick blanket. Every little thing now feels effortful and earnest. Shopping runs are missions during which we stand on crosses of electrical tape, listening to our own trepidatious gulps. Once outside, we can breathe again but heave the odd sad sigh, too, as we wander past shuttered shops. For the most part, we’ve all retreated behind closed doors, into a kind of collective, solitary darkness. Yet it is in this darkness that acts of kindness, and compassion, and levity, and connection – like a concert cellist playing beside a street gutter – stand out best. Some gestures flicker in our eyes like birthday candles. Others light up the night like benevolent flares. Everyone has a favourite pandemic pick-me-up. Perhaps you were touched by that co-ordinated minute of mass applause throughout the UK, as people stood clapping for the exhausted carers within their National Health Service. Or maybe you love the daily appointment Italians have kept, playing music together at dusk, singing Volare from a balcony, or trumpeting on a street corner. Replay   For me it’s the smaller things, for they are legion and just as lovely. A basket of groceries left on a doorstep. A hand-written letter to an old friend. Rural neighbours gathering, at a safe distance, for a chinwag and a beer over the back fence. A gift. A surprise. An approach. Pleas made, heard, answered. They’re all so tiny and bright. They’re spreading, too; each warm act sparking a glow in another, like a chain of globes, blinking on and lighting up, one by one.Blink. Still here.Blink. Still smiling.Blink. Still love you. When the shutdown began, Christina Melrose was having a shit afternoon. She’s the regional general manager of a residential disability support service, and doing a PhD in psychology, and raising three kids, so is “naturally horrifically disorganised”. “I’d had a fairly intense day at work, with communicable disease planning, and was just feeling a bit flat,” Melrose, 35, tells me (via phone, because that’s the only wise way to interview people right now). “I was definitely due for a bit of a pick-me-up.” Instead, she pulled into her greengrocer, Gippsland Fresh Wholesale, in Warragul east of Melbourne, and her day got worse. She saw a woman in a tizz. Frantic. She couldn’t find food for her dog on the denuded shelves, and was close to tears. Melrose couldn’t help, so she trudged away, shoulders slumped, and began loading the car. Hard day. Christina Melrose, who gave away toilet rolls in a carpark: “This one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on people I’m never likely to meet.”Credit:Josh Robenstone  There in her boot, she noticed her stash of Who Gives A Crap toilet paper. Melrose has been a subscriber to the charitable service for a while, so she won’t face any shortage. On a whim, she snatched up the pack and skipped through the carpark. She left rolls on roofs and bonnets and side mirrors. She moved with stealth but one lady spotted her, and instantly started crying. Weeping, in fact. The woman had Crohn’s disease – an inflammatory bowel condition – and had been down to her last roll. Melrose fetched her another. Then another woman, witnessing this, handed over the roll Melrose had left for her. “This poor woman – now with three rolls – grabbed me and gave me a big hug, which you can’t exactly say no to,” says Melrose. “She was sobbing. And I was sobbing.” The interaction buoyed her. She told two mates about it online that night; then the alerts began to pop up. Melrose had been tagged. A few of the recipients of her kindness had not needed her TP, and apparently paid her rolls forward. One was handed to an expectant mother. Another to an elderly man on a mobility scooter. “It was amazing how this one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on all these other people I’m never likely to meet,” Melrose says. “I never imagined that toilet paper could be a mechanism for division or unity. It’s that old adage: if you’ve got more than you need, you build a longer table, not a higher fence.” What’s extraordinary about a story like this one is that, in this moment we’re facing – this pause in our lives – such stories have become ordinary. Dr Catherine Barrett was at home in St Kilda on Saturday March 14, alone except for her schnauzer, Agnes. This was in the early days of panic buying, and the La Trobe University researcher and elderly advocacy expert was watching the news. Supermarket workers were breaking up brawls, sporting scratches and bruises. “I’ve had depression and anxiety in the past, and I know enough about my mental health to know that in situations like this I have to be proactive,” says Barrett. “For me it’s eating good food, and exercising, but also finding something, psychologically, to grab a hold of. Kindness seemed to calm my anxiety. I found myself listening to the health reports and government advice each day, but then switching off and focusing on stories of love and hope, and people doing beautiful, constructive things.” It became a salve. It was good for her; it had to be good for others. So she sat down at her little desk, in her two-room studio, and created a Facebook page called The Kindness Pandemic – an online repository for all things joyous. Barrett got a few dozen followers quickly enough. Then a few hundred. A few thousand. Within a few days, 60,000. Within a week, 250,000. At the time of writing, the group has more than half a million members. The page is a vertiginous giddy spool of good deeds and encouragement. There are long testimonials, videos and cute photos, but Barrett’s favourites are the simple ones, like this: I bought a caramel Twirl. At a supermarket. And I gave it to the staff member. And she cried. “You’ve spent $2.50, and you’ve transformed that person’s experience and reality,” Barrett says. “And I just thought, ‘This can be so simple. Everybody can do this.’ ” And people are. Within 30 seconds online I find myself clicking through from The Kindness Pandemic to Love Your Neighbour to the Preston Good Karma Network to Viral Kindness Northern Beaches Sydney to The Frankston Community Noticeboard, and that’s just on Facebook. In the current crisis, a community network like Nextdoor, a hyperlocal app which helps users reach out to those who live nearby, has come into its own. Victoria Vassallo, 22, joined last year, to stay in touch with other South Yarra residents about local break-ins. As the pandemic took hold, the fifth-year Monash University arts/law student thought of another use: offering spare boxes of tampons and pads to women running low. She wrote a post, not expecting to hear much, then came the urgent replies: “Do you have any super period pads available?” and “OMG so need some!” The next day – taking a break from the books, equity law specifically – Vassallo took a short walk to leave a box of pads (Evamay regular) for a woman recovering at home after surgery. “We’re in such a weird time, with so much negativity and hurt, and people losing their jobs, we just need to look around to see if we can help,” she says. “Give away something you don’t need. It’s our duty as citizens.” Replay   Adam Lust couldn’t agree more. He usually spends his Monday through Sunday in a Lexus SUV, ferrying people throughout Melbourne for Nicerride, his premium carriage service. The novel coronavirus has crippled his small business. Lust has barely had a paid job since mid-March. Yet this was the message he sent to his regular clients: If anyone you know, particularly the elderly or unwell, needs anything picked up or delivered from a chemist or a supermarket or post office or anywhere else, we are happy to volunteer our help in any way we can. Soon enough he was in his suit for his first free delivery: groceries and snacks for the families of the tiny patients at Monash Children’s Hospital. A few days later, some of that kindness came flowing back, when a client booked a midnight run, then paid Lust double the fare. “It might just help me cover my rent this week,” he says. “This is the power of relationships. This is humanity.” He’s not the only one using a dormant vehicle well. “DJ Nige” (Nigel Beck, 63) usually spins tunes in Deirdre, his green 1970 Volkswagen Kombi, but every booking has vanished, from the Collingwood Football Club season launch to his own daughter’s wedding. So DJ Nige just drives around Gippsland now, stopping in country towns to play What the World Needs Now Is Love and other tunes. His roadshow might take in Moe, Morwell, Maffra, who knows. “I’ll just go where the mood takes me,” Nige says. “I get such a beautiful reaction: kids busting a few moves, a few people crying.” Altona IGA owner Hitesh Palta, left, with a customer. His supermarket was the first to introduce an elderly-only shopping hour.Credit:Jason South In an otherwise ageist world, the elderly are being treated as they should. Most supermarket chains in Australia swiftly launched dedicated shopping hours, to give the vulnerable a chance to gather supplies before the shelves are stripped bare each day – but the practice actually began at a little IGA in suburban Melbourne’s Altona with owner Hitesh Palta. Palta had seen the footage of clamouring masses, and lines for hand sanitiser, and knew he had to act. “I never thought our society would … do something like this that would hurt our elderly,” he said. “We need to stick together at this time. We all need to help one another through this.” That’s precisely what Sumit Malhotra was thinking when he began offering free daily takeaway meals to senior citizens at the six Aangan Indian restaurants he owns throughout Victoria. Malhotra, who grew up in Jaipur, had witnessed his sales fall from the usual level by 25 per cent one week, 40 per cent the next, 70 per cent the week after. But he wasn’t thinking of that when he saw a disoriented old lady outside her grocer. She had wanted meat but couldn’t find any. No pasta, either. She was spinning – panicked and afraid. “I said, ‘My restaurant is next door. Why don’t you come next door and I’ll cook you something?’ She had a lamb curry and tried to give me money. I said, ‘No, and tomorrow if there is a problem again, you come straight here.’ When people are pressing the panic button, we need to do something to help people feel calm and secure. These acts of kindness: they are like a virus, too. People see them, and there is this human tendency to follow good things.” This is correct. We are wired this way. “What’s interesting about kindness is we do it for the benefit of others, but it also gives the giver a little booster shot. All of that benefits the group, too, so it’s not just win-win. It’s actually a win-win-win situation.” That’s Professor Lea Waters, founder of the Centre for Positive Psychology at Melbourne University. Waters researches and teaches the science of happiness, at least when she isn’t holed up at home in the eastern suburb of Blackburn with two teenagers. Waters says evolutionary psychologists have long found evidence of the “social glue” that holds us together – kindness, compassion, empathy, altruism – throughout history, across all cultures. The obvious emotional benefits are not intangible, either. “There’s extensive research into what happens when someone laughs with you, and how that changes your physiology, and how your brain gets a little shot of oxytocin, which makes you feel bonded, and which lowers your cortisol level, which relieves stress, which increases our ability to function well,” Waters says. “Intimacy has this biological effect, allowing the individual, and the group, to soothe itself.” Anna Krien left handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood asking if they needed help with anything. Credit:Jesse Marlow Before people began printing pro forma notes to leave in letterboxes, offering to help their neighbours in need – a wonderful idea – the author Anna Krien was already leaving handwritten cards for the older people in her Williamstown neighbourhood. She posted one note online, with an offer to drop off food or wine, magazines or books, even precious toilet roll. It was decorated with a crayon drawing of a shark, by one of her young sons. “It just seemed like a normal and natural thing to do,” she tells me. “To let people know we’re here, we’re thinking of them, we have legs, and youth. We can scout for them.” Dr Raj, a few doors down, was desperate for porridge, so she found him some oats. “We’ll have more orders coming in soon; people are getting nervous. We may live to regret it.” Krien laughs, with a hint of fatalism, and we talk about the implicit reward in offering to help someone out. “In a sense there’s a degree of selfishness to it,” she says. “Nietzsche talks about how charity is more about making the giver feel good than actually doing something helpful.” She may be referring to his book On the Genealogy of Morals, in which the philosopher suggests giving and helping are “petty” pleasures, and refers to good deeds as “the happiness of ‘slight superiority’ ”. “Maybe it was just a thing that made us feel good,” Krien muses. “So far, even though we’re all obsessed with coronavirus, things have been easy, but we don’t know how it’s going to go. Come the Depression, I’d like to think I’ll be one of those people who take others in for a meal. I hope I would be.” I wonder if she thinks we’ll be changed by this in a positive way. Will we take succour from the altruism around us, and carry that into whatever our next reality holds? Krien pauses. “Probably not … ” she says. “We might have this brief scare, try to get our priorities straight. But fear and trauma can do ugly things, too.” I worry that the kindnesses we have witnessed so far – which seem so overwhelming in number and nature – only seem that way because we’re looking for them, because we crave them. Ever since the rise of the alt right, Trumpism, Brexit chaos, #MeToo and the climate catastrophe, we have sought snug little stories of safety and comfort. Media organisations globally now curate heart-warming tales into landing pages and content streams. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age recently added sections to their websites called, simply, “Good News” – where readers can devour stories about pandemic pen pals, suburban teddy bear hunts or self-isolated opera singers performing I Still Call Australia Home from a unit balcony in Sydney’s Waterloo. Maybe we’re witnessing all this positivity now because it’s all we can bear to see. Replay   I’m also struck by how many of those doing good deeds tend to already be carers. At random I find five touching stories of empathy online – from a lady distributing care packages to the disabled, to a woman purchasing pet food en masse for an animal shelter – and contact them. And those five people are, in order, a community health care worker from Melbourne’s Coburg, a road trauma recovery specialist from Sydney’s Vaucluse, an Adult Intensive Care Unit nurse from Brisbane, the convenor of an online support group for Pakistani mums, and a primary school integration aide. So have we really been changed by this harsh moment, or are we just finally noticing the do-gooders in our midst? I would like to think, at least, that the inventive acts of human connection we’re witnessing are something fresh. We’re certainly coming up with new expressions – like “caremongering”, or being “groupish” (instead of selfish) – for behaviours born largely online. Something does seem to have shifted in the digital realm. The pandemic becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? Look no further than writer and refugee advocate Nadine Cohen, whose Twitter identity – all her posts are written in capital letters and start with the words F… YEAH – is a mixture of hilarious righteous outrage and raw compassion. A recent post offered a shout out to a lovely worker at Baker’s Delight in Bondi Junction, who at closing time offered her a free bag of bread rolls then – once she learnt she was about to visit Somalian refugees self-isolating in Merrylands – gave her seven bags instead. “It was really nice of her,” says Cohen. “There’s been so much attention paid to the hoarding, and fights in supermarkets, but I’ve seen a lot of warmth, both offline and online.” Cohen was once a creative strategist for Google, and has found Twitter in particular to be a newly positive space. Notwithstanding misinformation about bogus coronavirus cures, or ineffective recipes for home-made hand sanitiser – or racist attacks on Asian Australians – the goodwill has been overwhelming. “We’ve gotten more donations than we can fit in my car. We’ve been humbled by kindness, more than wounded by nastiness.” Social media, formerly a place of wasted hours, cyber bullying and narcissism, appears to have morphed into a force for good. Even the celebrity posturing feels more real than affectation. It’s actually quite nice to watch Keith Urban singing on Instagram, thanking healthcare workers and first responders, while Our Nicole dances in the foreground like a barefoot goofball. It’s cute listening to J-Lo and A-Rod do the “couples challenge”: answering stupid, funny questions about their life together in isolation, however gilded and privileged that existence might be. And it’s downright beautiful to hear Patrick Stewart reading Shakespearean sonnets, because such posts are now something more than light entertainment, they’re moments of connection. Hand in hand with this renewed intimacy online has come the decline in IRL (in real life) obligations. No more work dinners or cocktail functions or coffee meetings. Any meetings, really. Nor any school fêtes or parent-teacher interviews. The pandemic thus becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? In the blurb for her book Happy Never After: Why the Happiness Fairytale is Driving Us Mad (and How I Flipped the Script), writer Jill Stark asks, “What would happen if we stopped chasing, stayed still, found calm and meaning in places we least expected?” I wonder if 2020 is our chance to answer that question. “I think 21st-century living, for many of us, has felt like we’re pounding a treadmill and going nowhere. It’s fast-paced, relentless, endless, and in an age in which we’re so connected online we’re still profoundly disconnected from each other – and from our own wants and needs,” Stark tells me from her desk. She talks about our uniquely modern malaise – “the cult of busyness” – and how racing towards burnout has become a competitive sport. “For many people, this will be the first time they’ll have to be still,” says Stark, who is also a consultant for Beyond Blue. “Human nature tells us we quickly switch back to old habits and forget the reasons we wanted to make a change, but for some people – hopefully – this moment of logging off and pausing will profoundly alter the way they live their lives going forward, reminding them of what matters – and who matters – most.” For the Sunshine Singers, a mixed seniors choir who meet for two hours every Monday morning, and have done for a decade, what matters most is music, and one another. The group, run by Waverley Council in Sydney’s east, has been tested more than most this past month. It is usually three dozen strong at Bondi Pavilion, but herding them together online – for their first ever gathering by video conference – was a challenge. “They can be a bit technophobic,” laughs Cassy Bartolomei, 55, the freelance singer and teacher who leads them. “When the soft shutdown began, I was worried. A lot of them are truly stuck at home. And a lot of them live alone.” The choir is their weekly chance to venture outside, from their apartments and aged care facilities in Homebush, Concord, Bronte. They usually start with scales and rounds, and learn a new song before recapping old ones. This time Bartolomei didn’t teach them anything new. They belted out You’re the Voice by John Farnham. They crooned Young at Heart by Frank Sinatra. The song they did last was Close to You, by the Carpenters: Why do birds, suddenly appear, every time, you are near? Just like me, they long to be, close to you… The Sunshine Singers, a seniors choir from Sydney’s east, make beautiful music together, now online.Credit:@waverleycouncil/Instargram It’s challenging. The platform means they can’t all hear one another, so they aren’t getting the raised endorphins they usually do when their voices unite. There are lags and connectivity issues. It’s messy. “But they can see everyone, their mouths moving,” says Bartolomei. “It is so much better than nothing.” They all felt happier just for having a sing. One woman is on a post-cancer drug program, with a repressed immune system: “I’m so alone and lonely,” she said. “This has just lifted my day.” Another woman said her smile was back: “My body is tingling. I’m getting emotional. Sing on, Sunshine Singers!” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying. Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald’s newsletter here and The Age’s here. Bartolomei was, in truth, thrilled before they even began – when they first appeared on her computer display. She’d sent them links and download instructions, but still wondered how they would cope. “I was terrified,” she laughs. “I thought I was going to sit here alone, with people not knowing what button to press.” She needn’t have fretted. “One member is in her 90s, and there she was! Her little face, in a square, on the screen, on Monday morning!” Bartolomei says. “Then all these other little beautiful faces started appearing. Bing! Bing!! Bing-Bing-Bing!!! They were just so divine.” They’re all looking forward to next Monday morning, too, when they get to sing together again, see their friends again, when their faces will pop into the frame again, one after another, and another, coronavirus be damned. Bing! Still here.Bing! Still together.Bing! Still singing. To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

Profiteering, finger pointing and fear. The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the worst in some. But look a little deeper and a far more potent story is unfolding: one of kindness, connection and trust. By Konrad Marshall Taking it to the streets … chamber musician Josephine Vains plays a social distancing “concert” for her neighbourhood in Melbourne’s Brunswick.Credit:Chris Hopkins It’s the end of the last Sunday in March, and after dipping low in the vanilla autumn sky, the sun throws all its light on MacFarland Street. A yellow glow kisses this little road in Brunswick, in Melbourne’s inner north. It dances on the puddles left by an afternoon storm. Catches the buzzing mozzies. Hits old chimneys, and iron lace balustrades, and aluminium roofs. And one musical instrument. The latter is an antique cello, made in 1830 of flamed maple and spruce, by a master craftsman from London. And it is embraced by its owner, Josephine Vains, who sits on a chair between two paperbark trees – near her parsley patch and her passionfruit creeper and her yellow recycling bin – on the footpath in front of her cream brick home. Musician Josephine Vains: “This is my way of feeling like I’m continuing to do what I always do. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.""Credit:Chris Hopkins Vains, 45, is a chamber musician who has played with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and taught at the Victorian College of the Arts. She has performed in European cathedrals of gothic splendour. Modern recital centres in the US. The ancient Longyou Caves in China. The bottom of a mine shaft in Macedon in Victoria’s Goldfields region. “Thank you for coming,” she says to her neighbours, around three dozen of whom have, on cue, left self-isolation to come together – while remaining many, many metres apart – for a little concert born on a local WhatsApp group. “I hope you enjoy the show.” They do. They might not recognise the last names of the long-dead composers on the set list, but they recognise beauty in suburbia. As Vains plays Gabrielli, a happy couple sitting on folding chairs – with teardrop wine glasses and a bottle of Margaret River cabernet sauvignon – rise to applaud. As she plays Saint-Saëns, a nuclear family crammed inside their blue Landrover Discovery are rapturous. As she plays the famous prelude from Cello Suite No. 1 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and The Sound of Silence by Simon & Garfunkel, others clap and grin from their verandahs and driveways, leaning against a front gate, or listening through an open bedroom window. “Beautiful!” yells one man, from a distance. “Thank you!” waves another. “Thanks Josie!” says her next-door neighbour. “That was the first time I’ve heard you,” adds a bloke from around the corner – an interloper from Osborne Street, two blocks down. “And I cried. It was really beautiful.” Vains smiles. All the paid performances on her calendar are cancelled due to COVID-19, but this makes that more bearable. She’s been playing a show at sunset every few days since the last week of March: a handful of songs, for this street and for herself. “This is my way of feeling … like I’m just continuing to do what I always do,” she says afterward. “I feel quite high now. It’s a natural high. And I think they feel that way, too. We all need something to look forward to. Something to do and hear. Together.” Do we ever. It’s surreal, this silent, sequestered life we’re leading, this isolation in a coronaviral vacuum. It’s so often quiet and largely numb, yet punctuated by unwelcome sensations, isn’t it? You’ve probably felt one or two. The cold prickle of anxiety. The crack of social dislocation. For me it’s lethargy, sometimes as a sharp strain behind my eyes, but more often like a thick blanket. Every little thing now feels effortful and earnest. Shopping runs are missions during which we stand on crosses of electrical tape, listening to our own trepidatious gulps. Once outside, we can breathe again but heave the odd sad sigh, too, as we wander past shuttered shops. For the most part, we’ve all retreated behind closed doors, into a kind of collective, solitary darkness. Yet it is in this darkness that acts of kindness, and compassion, and levity, and connection – like a concert cellist playing beside a street gutter – stand out best. Some gestures flicker in our eyes like birthday candles. Others light up the night like benevolent flares. Everyone has a favourite pandemic pick-me-up. Perhaps you were touched by that co-ordinated minute of mass applause throughout the UK, as people stood clapping for the exhausted carers within their National Health Service. Or maybe you love the daily appointment Italians have kept, playing music together at dusk, singing Volare from a balcony, or trumpeting on a street corner. Replay   For me it’s the smaller things, for they are legion and just as lovely. A basket of groceries left on a doorstep. A hand-written letter to an old friend. Rural neighbours gathering, at a safe distance, for a chinwag and a beer over the back fence. A gift. A surprise. An approach. Pleas made, heard, answered. They’re all so tiny and bright. They’re spreading, too; each warm act sparking a glow in another, like a chain of globes, blinking on and lighting up, one by one.Blink. Still here.Blink. Still smiling.Blink. Still love you. When the shutdown began, Christina Melrose was having a shit afternoon. She’s the regional general manager of a residential disability support service, and doing a PhD in psychology, and raising three kids, so is “naturally horrifically disorganised”. “I’d had a fairly intense day at work, with communicable disease planning, and was just feeling a bit flat,” Melrose, 35, tells me (via phone, because that’s the only wise way to interview people right now). “I was definitely due for a bit of a pick-me-up.” Instead, she pulled into her greengrocer, Gippsland Fresh Wholesale, in Warragul east of Melbourne, and her day got worse. She saw a woman in a tizz. Frantic. She couldn’t find food for her dog on the denuded shelves, and was close to tears. Melrose couldn’t help, so she trudged away, shoulders slumped, and began loading the car. Hard day. Christina Melrose, who gave away toilet rolls in a carpark: “This one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on people I’m never likely to meet.”Credit:Josh Robenstone  There in her boot, she noticed her stash of Who Gives A Crap toilet paper. Melrose has been a subscriber to the charitable service for a while, so she won’t face any shortage. On a whim, she snatched up the pack and skipped through the carpark. She left rolls on roofs and bonnets and side mirrors. She moved with stealth but one lady spotted her, and instantly started crying. Weeping, in fact. The woman had Crohn’s disease – an inflammatory bowel condition – and had been down to her last roll. Melrose fetched her another. Then another woman, witnessing this, handed over the roll Melrose had left for her. “This poor woman – now with three rolls – grabbed me and gave me a big hug, which you can’t exactly say no to,” says Melrose. “She was sobbing. And I was sobbing.” The interaction buoyed her. She told two mates about it online that night; then the alerts began to pop up. Melrose had been tagged. A few of the recipients of her kindness had not needed her TP, and apparently paid her rolls forward. One was handed to an expectant mother. Another to an elderly man on a mobility scooter. “It was amazing how this one spontaneous decision went on to have an impact on all these other people I’m never likely to meet,” Melrose says. “I never imagined that toilet paper could be a mechanism for division or unity.

We can scout for them.” Dr Raj, a few doors down, was desperate for porridge, so she found him some oats. “We’ll have more orders coming in soon; people are getting nervous. We may live to regret it.” Krien laughs, with a hint of fatalism, and we talk about the implicit reward in offering to help someone out. “In a sense there’s a degree of selfishness to it,” she says. “Nietzsche talks about how charity is more about making the giver feel good than actually doing something helpful.” She may be referring to his book On the Genealogy of Morals, in which the philosopher suggests giving and helping are “petty” pleasures, and refers to good deeds as “the happiness of ‘slight superiority’ ”. “Maybe it was just a thing that made us feel good,” Krien muses. “So far, even though we’re all obsessed with coronavirus, things have been easy, but we don’t know how it’s going to go. Come the Depression, I’d like to think I’ll be one of those people who take others in for a meal. I hope I would be.” I wonder if she thinks we’ll be changed by this in a positive way. Will we take succour from the altruism around us, and carry that into whatever our next reality holds? Krien pauses. “Probably not … ” she says. “We might have this brief scare, try to get our priorities straight. But fear and trauma can do ugly things, too.” I worry that the kindnesses we have witnessed so far – which seem so overwhelming in number and nature – only seem that way because we’re looking for them, because we crave them. Ever since the rise of the alt right, Trumpism, Brexit chaos, #MeToo and the climate catastrophe, we have sought snug little stories of safety and comfort. Media organisations globally now curate heart-warming tales into landing pages and content streams. The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age recently added sections to their websites called, simply, “Good News” – where readers can devour stories about pandemic pen pals, suburban teddy bear hunts or self-isolated opera singers performing I Still Call Australia Home from a unit balcony in Sydney’s Waterloo. Maybe we’re witnessing all this positivity now because it’s all we can bear to see. Replay   I’m also struck by how many of those doing good deeds tend to already be carers. At random I find five touching stories of empathy online – from a lady distributing care packages to the disabled, to a woman purchasing pet food en masse for an animal shelter – and contact them. And those five people are, in order, a community health care worker from Melbourne’s Coburg, a road trauma recovery specialist from Sydney’s Vaucluse, an Adult Intensive Care Unit nurse from Brisbane, the convenor of an online support group for Pakistani mums, and a primary school integration aide. So have we really been changed by this harsh moment, or are we just finally noticing the do-gooders in our midst? I would like to think, at least, that the inventive acts of human connection we’re witnessing are something fresh. We’re certainly coming up with new expressions – like “caremongering”, or being “groupish” (instead of selfish) – for behaviours born largely online. Something does seem to have shifted in the digital realm. The pandemic becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? Look no further than writer and refugee advocate Nadine Cohen, whose Twitter identity – all her posts are written in capital letters and start with the words F… YEAH – is a mixture of hilarious righteous outrage and raw compassion. A recent post offered a shout out to a lovely worker at Baker’s Delight in Bondi Junction, who at closing time offered her a free bag of bread rolls then – once she learnt she was about to visit Somalian refugees self-isolating in Merrylands – gave her seven bags instead. “It was really nice of her,” says Cohen. “There’s been so much attention paid to the hoarding, and fights in supermarkets, but I’ve seen a lot of warmth, both offline and online.” Cohen was once a creative strategist for Google, and has found Twitter in particular to be a newly positive space. Notwithstanding misinformation about bogus coronavirus cures, or ineffective recipes for home-made hand sanitiser – or racist attacks on Asian Australians – the goodwill has been overwhelming. “We’ve gotten more donations than we can fit in my car. We’ve been humbled by kindness, more than wounded by nastiness.” Social media, formerly a place of wasted hours, cyber bullying and narcissism, appears to have morphed into a force for good. Even the celebrity posturing feels more real than affectation. It’s actually quite nice to watch Keith Urban singing on Instagram, thanking healthcare workers and first responders, while Our Nicole dances in the foreground like a barefoot goofball. It’s cute listening to J-Lo and A-Rod do the “couples challenge”: answering stupid, funny questions about their life together in isolation, however gilded and privileged that existence might be. And it’s downright beautiful to hear Patrick Stewart reading Shakespearean sonnets, because such posts are now something more than light entertainment, they’re moments of connection. Hand in hand with this renewed intimacy online has come the decline in IRL (in real life) obligations. No more work dinners or cocktail functions or coffee meetings. Any meetings, really. Nor any school fêtes or parent-teacher interviews. The pandemic thus becomes a moment to reset, and a chance to ask the question: was that really how I wanted my life to be? In the blurb for her book Happy Never After: Why the Happiness Fairytale is Driving Us Mad (and How I Flipped the Script), writer Jill Stark asks, “What would happen if we stopped chasing, stayed still, found calm and meaning in places we least expected?” I wonder if 2020 is our chance to answer that question. “I think 21st-century living, for many of us, has felt like we’re pounding a treadmill and going nowhere. It’s fast-paced, relentless, endless, and in an age in which we’re so connected online we’re still profoundly disconnected from each other – and from our own wants and needs,” Stark tells me from her desk. She talks about our uniquely modern malaise – “the cult of busyness” – and how racing towards burnout has become a competitive sport. “For many people, this will be the first time they’ll have to be still,” says Stark, who is also a consultant for Beyond Blue. “Human nature tells us we quickly switch back to old habits and forget the reasons we wanted to make a change, but for some people – hopefully – this moment of logging off and pausing will profoundly alter the way they live their lives going forward, reminding them of what matters – and who matters – most.” For the Sunshine Singers, a mixed seniors choir who meet for two hours every Monday morning, and have done for a decade, what matters most is music, and one another. The group, run by Waverley Council in Sydney’s east, has been tested more than most this past month. It is usually three dozen strong at Bondi Pavilion, but herding them together online – for their first ever gathering by video conference – was a challenge. “They can be a bit technophobic,” laughs Cassy Bartolomei, 55, the freelance singer and teacher who leads them. “When the soft shutdown began, I was worried. A lot of them are truly stuck at home. And a lot of them live alone.” The choir is their weekly chance to venture outside, from their apartments and aged care facilities in Homebush, Concord, Bronte. They usually start with scales and rounds, and learn a new song before recapping old ones. This time Bartolomei didn’t teach them anything new. They belted out You’re the Voice by John Farnham. They crooned Young at Heart by Frank Sinatra. The song they did last was Close to You, by the Carpenters: Why do birds, suddenly appear, every time, you are near? Just like me, they long to be, close to you… The Sunshine Singers, a seniors choir from Sydney’s east, make beautiful music together, now online.Credit:@waverleycouncil/Instargram It’s challenging. The platform means they can’t all hear one another, so they aren’t getting the raised endorphins they usually do when their voices unite. There are lags and connectivity issues. It’s messy. “But they can see everyone, their mouths moving,” says Bartolomei. “It is so much better than nothing.” They all felt happier just for having a sing. One woman is on a post-cancer drug program, with a repressed immune system: “I’m so alone and lonely,” she said. “This has just lifted my day.” Another woman said her smile was back: “My body is tingling. I’m getting emotional. Sing on, Sunshine Singers!” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying. Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald’s newsletter here and The Age’s here. Bartolomei was, in truth, thrilled before they even began – when they first appeared on her computer display. She’d sent them links and download instructions, but still wondered how they would cope. “I was terrified,” she laughs. “I thought I was going to sit here alone, with people not knowing what button to press.” She needn’t have fretted. “One member is in her 90s, and there she was! Her little face, in a square, on the screen, on Monday morning!” Bartolomei says. “Then all these other little beautiful faces started appearing. Bing! Bing!! Bing-Bing-Bing!!! They were just so divine.” They’re all looking forward to next Monday morning, too, when they get to sing together again, see their friends again, when their faces will pop into the frame again, one after another, and another, coronavirus be damned. Bing! Still here.Bing! Still together.Bing! Still singing. To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times.

By Nigel Gladstone and Mark Stehle  Credit:Mark Stehle Less than four months after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in China, the global pandemic has killed more than 90,000 people and shutdown societies in Europe, America and Asia. The creep of coronavirus across Australia caught many people off guard despite weeks of warnings. Politicians were confident the 200 confirmed COVID-19 cases were under control on March 13 and told Australians they were going to the football on Saturday. The borders were closed on March 20, blocking all foreigners. Thousands of businesses were forced to shut on March 23 as coronavirus cases topped 1600. A week later, people leaving home ""unless absolutely necessary"" risk fines and jail. These charts track the number of new cases and deaths each day and are updated regularly with data from Johns Hopkins University. The pandemic is still accelerating after taking 67 days from the first reported case to reach 100,000 infections. It took 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, four days to add another 100,000 and just three days to reach 400,000 on March 25. A week later, there were more than a million cases. The pace of this pandemic is hard to understand because psychologically we struggle with exponential increases. Psychologists call this 'exponential growth bias'. People tend to think along linear growth lines (1, 2, 3, 4) even when it doesn't describe the reality unfolding before us. Exponential increases mean the numbers may double every few days. Italy was the first European country to go into regional lockdowns, culminating on March 8 with confinement of 16 million people in the north. But it took a while for people to respect the rules, with Italian police issuing more than 175,000 fines for breaking quarantine. On March 10, the entire country was locked down. On March 24, the maximum penalty for Italians caught leaving their home for no good reason was lifted to €3000 (around $5500), up from €206 ($375). Social restrictions and quarantines have been introduced gradually in most countries over several days and weeks, which means tracking exactly when lockdowns began is not possible. But the lag between when widely applied lockdowns begin and daily new infections and deaths decline is roughly a month. The three-to-four week lag correlates with China’s lockdown of Hubei province, the birthplace of the virus, on January 23. China was overwhelmed for more than a month, but extreme lockdowns – including a ban on all transport into and out of Wuhan with no exceptions for personal or medical emergencies – ‘flattened the curve’. China has started lifting restrictions, with people allowed to leave Wuhan for the first time on Wednesday. The first case detected in Canada came on the same day as Australia’s first, January 25. Some Canadian provinces began restrictions – such as closing bars – before Australia acted and up until late March, Canada had fewer coronavirus cases. But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resisted putting the country into a nationwide lockdown like the UK did on March 23 and Australia did a week later. Canada closed its border with the world's largest infected population in the USA on March 21, but travel for work and to transport goods has continued. The United States, where infections are now more than twice the number seen anywhere else in the world, has no nationwide lockdown. Some cities, counties and states – including California and New York state – have put restrictions on citizens since mid-March, but the virus has spread widely. President Donald Trump expressed outrage on March 24, refusing to ""close the country"", saying he “would love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter”. But Mr Trump has changed his stance recently, warning Americans on Sunday to prepare for the ""toughest week"" of the coronavirus pandemic. Most Americans are now living under stay-at-home orders or other forms of lockdown imposed by state governments. Politicians in Italy, the UK, Sweden and America all mistakenly believed they could let COVID-19 sweep through the community, withstand a few weeks of hospitals being overloaded and then cases would fall due to herd immunity, Flinders University Professor of Medicine Nikolai Petrovsky said. ""Too many commentators made incorrect comparisons between COVID-19 and influenza,"" Professor Petrovsky said. ""The whole concept of easily achieving herd immunity was always completely spurious and would mean accepting over 60 million deaths globally and 250,000 deaths just in Australia. ""If we controlled the rate to 10,000 infections per day in Australia, it would take 5.7 years (to develop herd immunity)."" The United Kingdom is about two weeks behind when Italy hit 100 cases. In places where stringent precautions and high rates of testing have been implemented, such as in Taiwan and South Korea, the epidemic curves have been relatively flat.

However, the rate of new cases continues to decline under the government's social distancing and isolation measures. NSW accounts for 2773 confirmed cases – 39 new transmissions in the 24 hours up to 8pm on Wednesday night, the lowest number since March 16. Ahead of the Easter long weekend, Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged the public ""not to leave your home unless you absolutely have to"". A cluster of 12 coronavirus cases at Gosford Hospital was among 416 coronavirus transmissions that NSW health authorities have not been able to trace back to their source. The first case was detected on March 27. Within two weeks, two elderly patients, four family members and six nurses and doctors had tested positive for coronavirus. Several more staff were sent home to self-isolate as NSW Health authorities traced the contacts of the confirmed cases to identify anyone who may have come into contact with them while they were infectious. The affected ward has since been designated a dedicated COVID-19 unit for low-risk patients. Both patients in the hospital cluster have been isolated in single patient rooms and were recovering well, chief executive of Central Coast Local Health District Dr Andrew Montague said. Dr Montague said the health district had taken several precautions to prevent the spread of the virus within its hospitals, including splitting emergency departments into general and high-risk ""red"" COVID sections to separate patients with respiratory symptoms, screening staff before each shift and restricting visitors to one person per patient per visit.

A cluster of 23 COVID-19 cases in Tasmania's North West Regional Hospital – including 15 staff and five patients, and one discharged patient – accounts for more than one-fifth of the state's 107 confirmed coronavirus cases. Another 60 staff have been told to self-isolate. In Melbourne's The Alfred Hospital, a cluster of at least 15 cases – including five cancer patients (three of whom died) and 10 staff – knocked out more than 100 healthcare workers who had to self-isolate for 14 days. Last week the Herald reported two radiation therapists at Westmead Hospital tested positive for coronavirus, prompting two cancer patients and roughly 20 radiation oncology staff to self-isolate. Ryde Hospital was the nucleus of Australia's first cluster, that spread between the north-west hospital, the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility, two high schools, defence personnel and had links to a case at Liverpool Hospital. Up to 200 staff across Liverpool and Ryde hospitals were quarantined for 14 days as a result. The risk of clusters within hospitals is not unique to Australia. Major clusters in parts of the US and Europe have been traced back to hospitals. In March, Vietnam locked down one of its major hospitals after the country's biggest cluster of 16 people was linked to the facility. Healthcare workers have been identified as a high risk group for exposure to the virus. On Wednesday night, NSW Health revealed 127 confirmed cases in the state were healthcare workers during a teleconference with Australian Medical Association NSW members, though not all had contracted the virus at work.

18,/national/police-issue-165-000-in-covid-19-fines-but-only-two-in-sydney-s-worst-affected-area-20200409-p54ik3.html,"Police issue $165,000 in COVID-19 fines, but only two in Sydney's worst-affected area","Two of the 151 fines relating to COVID-19 issued so far by NSW Police have been handed out in Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases in the state and where crowded beaches have previously drawn strong criticism. Police have handed out more than $165,000 worth of fines and dozens of court attendance orders related to public health orders aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, with about one-third of all fines issued in just four areas - Sydney City, Canterbury-Bankstown, Liverpool and Fairfield. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says he will personally check every fine issued. Credit:Kate Geraghty Health Minister Brad Hazzard also announced a new fine of $5000 and up to six months in prison for people who spit or cough on frontline workers on Thursday. The announcement comes as unions say they have received dozens of reports of workers in a range of fields, including health and justice, being abused, spat and coughed on. “We are telling you to stop it or you will cop it with a $5000 fine,” Mr Hazzard said. One of the two fines issued in Waverley was given to a man who allegedly coughed on a police officer and a fine in Shoalhaven was given to a man who allegedly spat at officers. Both men claimed to have COVID-19. At least another four of the fines involved abuse towards police officers. NSW Police have provided location details for 129 of the 151 fines issued since March 17. Of these, nearly half have been issued in regional areas, which account for about 35 per cent of the state’s 2800 confirmed cases. Eight fines have been issued in areas with no cases - Cobar, Narrabri, Bourke and Moree Plains. A NSW Police spokesperson said there was no correlation between the number of people with the virus in a specific area and the number of people who have breached the public health order. However, legal experts have raised concerns that the fines, which are $1000 for individuals and $5000 for businesses, could disproportionately affect people in lower socioeconomic areas. Professor in Criminology at the University of Sydney Law School Murray Lee said the data suggested a map of disadvantage could be emerging, whereby those in lower socioeconomic areas are more likely to be slugged with a hefty fine. “Fines are very blunt instruments and they do hurt those that are less able to pay,” he said. The most fines and court notices outside Sydney have been issued in Shoalhaven, with eight fines, and Wagga Wagga and Lake Macquarie, with five in each. Shoalhaven has 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases and Wagga Wagga has 10 and Lake Macquarie has 47. Replay   In comparison, a total of three infringements have been given to the same man in the northern beaches, where there are 146 confirmed cases. There are 174 confirmed cases in Waverley. Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he would review each fine personally. However, solicitor with the Redfern Legal Centre's police accountability practice Samantha Lee said it would be more useful for Mr Fuller to provide police with clearer guidelines on issuing fines to ensure there was consistency. ""These are some of the most hefty fines and we're calling for a release of any guidelines and standard operating procedures that are being made available to police,"" Ms Lee said.

Police have handed out more than $165,000 worth of fines and dozens of court attendance orders related to public health orders aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, with about one-third of all fines issued in just four areas - Sydney City, Canterbury-Bankstown, Liverpool and Fairfield. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says he will personally check every fine issued. Credit:Kate Geraghty Health Minister Brad Hazzard also announced a new fine of $5000 and up to six months in prison for people who spit or cough on frontline workers on Thursday. The announcement comes as unions say they have received dozens of reports of workers in a range of fields, including health and justice, being abused, spat and coughed on. “We are telling you to stop it or you will cop it with a $5000 fine,” Mr Hazzard said. One of the two fines issued in Waverley was given to a man who allegedly coughed on a police officer and a fine in Shoalhaven was given to a man who allegedly spat at officers. Both men claimed to have COVID-19. At least another four of the fines involved abuse towards police officers. NSW Police have provided location details for 129 of the 151 fines issued since March 17. Of these, nearly half have been issued in regional areas, which account for about 35 per cent of the state’s 2800 confirmed cases. Eight fines have been issued in areas with no cases - Cobar, Narrabri, Bourke and Moree Plains. A NSW Police spokesperson said there was no correlation between the number of people with the virus in a specific area and the number of people who have breached the public health order. However, legal experts have raised concerns that the fines, which are $1000 for individuals and $5000 for businesses, could disproportionately affect people in lower socioeconomic areas. Professor in Criminology at the University of Sydney Law School Murray Lee said the data suggested a map of disadvantage could be emerging, whereby those in lower socioeconomic areas are more likely to be slugged with a hefty fine. “Fines are very blunt instruments and they do hurt those that are less able to pay,” he said. The most fines and court notices outside Sydney have been issued in Shoalhaven, with eight fines, and Wagga Wagga and Lake Macquarie, with five in each. Shoalhaven has 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases and Wagga Wagga has 10 and Lake Macquarie has 47. Replay   In comparison, a total of three infringements have been given to the same man in the northern beaches, where there are 146 confirmed cases. There are 174 confirmed cases in Waverley. Last week, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he would review each fine personally. However, solicitor with the Redfern Legal Centre's police accountability practice Samantha Lee said it would be more useful for Mr Fuller to provide police with clearer guidelines on issuing fines to ensure there was consistency. ""These are some of the most hefty fines and we're calling for a release of any guidelines and standard operating procedures that are being made available to police,"" Ms Lee said.

By comparison, Sydney Olympic Park recorded the highest rainfall across the city at 5.2mm. While inland regions may move closer to being able to shed their drought-declared status and start planting winter crops in earnest, the Rural Fire Service is watching the forecast with some concern. The RFS and other fire agencies typically do the bulk of any hazard-reduction burning during the period from about mid-March until the end of May when conditions turn too wet. The NSW fires started in July last year, destroying 5.5 million hectares and thousands of houses, and killing 25 people. The eight-day rainfall map shows that some parts of NSW could see as much as 100 millimetres of rain. Credit:BOM The long fire season, which officially ends on Tuesday, has meant many fire crews were exhausted from the long months of battling blazes. With extended rain, the window for controlled burns to limit the fuel load could be delayed further. James Morris, an RFS spokesman, said the coronavirus might also play a role in limiting the ability to conduct such burns. For one thing, crews may be restricted in gathering in appropriate numbers. Secondly, they may need to avoid lighting fires during periods of particularly stable air - otherwise ideal conditions to limit the chance of runaway fires - to prevent large areas such as the Sydney Basin from being blanketed in bushfire smoke. ""We wouldn't want to do anything to cause more damage for those with respiratory issues,"" he said, noting many COVID-19 sufferers might live in the Sydney area.

24,/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html,'We're not running out of dinosaurs': Why is there a boom in fossils?,"Jack Horner, the palaeontologist who inspired the movie juggernaut Jurassic Park, found his first dinosaur bone when he was just eight. His father had seen something sticking out of the earth as he rode across the prairies of Montana, North America, long the heartland of dinosaur discovery, and it was there that he took little Jack fossil hunting. The bone still sits in Horner’s office today. The success of Jurassic Park in 1993 would launch a new generation of palaeontologists and an unprecedented boom for the field, opening up frontiers from Argentina to Australia and rewriting the story of the scaly monsters on screen. Within three years, on a hillside in China, a farmer had stumbled upon the world’s first glimpse of a feathered dinosaur. Today, close to one new dinosaur species is discovered every week. This year the big find to hit headlines is a new species, and likely a new genus, of tyrannosaur exhumed from the dust of Alberta, Canada, pictured above. Far from the image of the lumbering lizard doomed to extinction, palaeontologists now know dinosaurs as nature’s great success stories. In their 185-million-year reign on Earth, they weathered tremendous upheaval. Continents broke apart, volcanoes rained lava, temperatures and toxic gases climbed, monster wildfires scarred the land. Still dinosaurs spread to all its corners, growing to the size of passenger planes or emerging in strange new shapes including, eventually, as birds. In South America and Asia, whole new ecosystems are being unearthed, from huge spiked herbivores to strange bat-winged “vampires”. In outback Australia, a literal treasure trove of fossils has been found down an opal mine, many species preserved as vibrant gems. Now in another era of planetary change (this time of our own making), and with news from NASA that an asteroid nearly the size of the one that took out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago will soon sail hair-raisingly close to the Earth – what can we learn from these creatures? How has palaeontology evolved since Jurassic Park?  What discoveries have put Australia on the map? And will we ever bring a dinosaur back to life? An artist's reconstruction of thanatotheristes or the Reaper of Death, discovered this year.  Credit:Julius Csotonyi Horner sat next to director Steven Spielberg as a consultant on the set of Jurassic Park, and remembers well the hordes of students who suddenly signed up for his university classes after the film hit cinemas. But it wasn't a flash in the pan, says palaeontologist and author Steve Brusatte, who has himself helped discover somewhere in the order of 15 to 20 new dinosaurs. The students kept coming and today the resulting gold rush of discovery shows no signs of slowing down. ""We're not running out of dinosaurs,"" Brusatte laughs. Palaeontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza has tracked the rate of new finds since the first bones were unearthed in the 1800s, including that sudden surge. He too belongs to the Jurassic Park generation, the scientists ""who never grew up"", but says better technology is also speeding up dinosaur hunting as they compare finds online. Out in the field, Horner says the tools are still mostly what they were when he started. Dinosaur bones eventually become rock (and in some places, such as Australia, gem stone), which makes them nearly impossible to pick out from the landscape with scanners. Yet, back in the lab, X-rays, 3D printing, even molecular particle accelerators now come into play. ""And we can send drones out for us now to take pictures,” Horner says. All of those fresh eyes in the field can sometimes catch what has been missed. This year’s new tyrannosaur on the block gathered dust in a museum cabinet for almost a decade before PhD student Jared Voris decided to take a closer look. Now dubbed the Reaper of Death, the tyrannosaur is the oldest found in Canada. In life, it would have been about the length of two cars. ""We're confident it's a new genus as well as a new species,"" Voris says. ""The ridges in the jaw and the [shape of] the cheekbones are really different."" But sometimes, Horner warns, the hype can get ahead of the science. Many dinosaurs vary wildly in size and shape over their life cycle and baby dinosaurs have on occasion been ""discovered"" as their own separate species.

Credit:Royal Tyrrell Museum  To survive the tens of millions of years between death and discovery, dinosaur remains need cover from the elements. Most will decay completely but sometimes the conditions are just right for preservation - usually when an animal dies near water and is buried under sediment such as mud or silt. Water infused with minerals will seep into the hard, longer-wearing parts, the bones or teeth, as they break down, gradually replacing and encasing them. Over millennia, they are compressed into rock or ""fossil"". Sometimes other substances such as tar or ice can do an even better job of preserving the original remains, leading to remarkable discoveries such as intact feathers or even soft tissue. An artist's impression of the seven-metre-long Lightning Claw, the largest carnivorous dinosaur found in Australia. On Australia's west coast, some of the world's largest surviving dinosaur footprints are still in the rock, spanning almost two metres each. But it is on the east coast that most of Australia's fossil record is being dug up – and it's taken a “quantum leap forward” in the past few years, according to the Australian Museum. One hundred million years ago, in the last great age of dinosaurs known as the Cretaceous period, the dry continent was lush and green. Pterosaurs or “iron dragons” ruled the skies and ancient crocodiles shared hunting grounds with creatures such as Lightning Claw, pictured above, the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever found in Australia, with its ""grappling hooks"" for hands. Much of the east was swamped by a shallow inland sea – creating the perfect conditions for fossils. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove."" While our most complete dinosaur skeletons have come from Queensland, opal miners in remote NSW have stumbled upon the most beautiful. Down a mine shaft in Lightning Ridge is one of the richest fossil collections ever discovered from Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that once accounted for two-thirds of today’s land, including Australia. Here, dinosaur remains were buried under reactive minerals – glass or silica ash – from a chain of volcanoes erupting up north near the Great Barrier Reef at the time. Under the ""Martian-like"" conditions, the most unique opals in the world took shape in the rock – and in dinosaur bone. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove,” laughs Phil Bell, a palaeontologist at the University of New England. ""Some species have rich veins of colour through them, blues and reds."" Fossils have been picked out of opal hauls since mining began at the site in the 1900s – Australia's first prehistoric mammals were discovered there as well as some dinosaur species. But it’s hard work, climbing metres down rickety ladders into black chasms to dig with pick axes and jackhammers. Most of what’s been found has come off the back of the miners themselves. Even then, no one had studied the fossils in depth until 2013, when Bell ventured into the dark beneath Lightning Ridge and found a wealth of life, including Lightning Claw and an entire herd of the plant eater Fostoria. ""Not all of the bones are gem-quality, a lot are just the dark or opaque part of the opal, but some of those Fostoria bones do shimmer with the entire spectrum of colours,"" Bell says. ""These things are worth tens of thousands of dollars as jewellery but they're priceless as fossils.""

Credit:James Kuether They are so precious that palaeontologists and the Australian Opal Centre are working with the local mining community to save them from commercial trade. When broken up for their gems, the fossils fetch a decent sum. But in a region hit hard by drought, they can bring more value, the argument goes, as a tourist attraction. ""Until Lightning Ridge, we'd been dealing with scraps from Victoria's coast and Queensland,"" Bell explains. ""We had those beautiful big [sauropod] tracks in Broome but that was our sole image of what dinosaurs in Australia looked like. Suddenly, here was this virtually untapped window into our past."" Paleontologist Phil Bell excavating for opalised fossils in the Lightning Ridge mine.Credit:Phil Bell It's not only scientists looking for dinosaurs. While ""bone wars"" have been raging since the 1800s, as paleontologists and collectors haggled over finds, the field's technology boom has also made it easier for black market traders to beat researchers to sites. Of course, a lot of dinosaur hunting depends on whose land you're on and regulation varies between countries and states. In Canada, all discoveries are the property of the Crown. In much of Australia and other parts of the world, if the bones are found on private land, they belong to that landowner. If they are held in a private collection, many paleontologists consider them scientifically worthless as they cannot be studied by others. Like a rare Rembrandt, T-Rex skeletons and other fossils are fast becoming status symbols and stolen bones routinely surface at high-profile auctions with forged paperwork. A bidding war reportedly broke out between actors Nicolas Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio over a $276,000 dinosaur skull. Cage won but had to return the skull in 2015 when it emerged it had been smuggled illegally out of Mongolia, a mecca for fossils but also a hot spot for dinosaur crime, Bell warns. He is one of a growing number of paleontologists now using hand-held Star-Trek style scanners ""a bit like hairdryers"" to trace the chemical fingerprints of bones and so help determine where they might have been poached from. In Australia, our rare opalised fossils cannot be exported without a permit (which are hard to come by). But their rarity makes them highly sought after on the black market.

Researchers hunt for clues that will tell them not just the kind of animal they've found but how it lived. Dinosaurs, like sharks, shed their teeth often, Bell says, and in sites such as Lightning Ridge, palaeontologists can piece together whole ecosystems.

Fossils can be 3D printed, and species run through the same engineering software used to test the structural integrity of dams and bridges to explore how they would have moved, if they could fly, the way T-Rex really handled those tiny arms. The newly unveiled tyrannosaur find also provides clues about the ecology of North America during the Cretaceous period – further evidence, according to Voris, of an apparent split in the land between 89 million and 74 million years ago. “In the north, Montana, Alberta, we see really different species to further south, like Utah, alive at the exact same time but there's nothing in the land so far we've found to tell us why,” he says. “We have to keep digging.” Above: A new species of raptor, Zhenyuanlong, which Brusatte helped discover in China and an impression by Zhao Chuang of the creature, which couldn't fly.  In parts of the world such as China, whole areas have been preserved under almost Pompeii-like conditions by past volcanic eruptions or sudden floods, allowing scientists to find remarkably well-preserved feathers. Under X-rays, they've even extrapolated the colour pigments, turning the old drab green and brown dinosaur palette on its head in an explosion of flamboyant blues, reds and yellows. Given feathers appeared on many species too big to fly, Brusatte says it’s likely the filaments didn’t evolve for the purpose of taking to the skies and might have first been used in mating display. But while feathers on species such as velociraptor were met with a lot of fanfare (some museum collections changed their exhibits overnight), elsewhere scientists such as Bell have examined the scaly skin of a T-Rex. “The hype around feathers kind of steamrolled a lot of other evidence,” Bell says. “There were lots of feathered dinosaurs but we still [think] most had scaly skin.” Of course, just as it would be difficult to discover from skeletons many of the wonders of the natural world today, from whale song to lyrebird mimicry, Chiarenza says there are things palaeontology will likely never know. ""Because of the way fossils form, we'll probably never find animals that lived in the mountains,"" he says. ""There might have been all kinds of strange creatures there, like we have gorillas and [big cats] today.""

It was Horner's own research on dinosaur babies that helped inspire Michael Crichton to write Jurassic Park – Sam Neill would go on to play the role based on Horner, Dr Alan Grant, in the film adaptation. While Horner didn’t meet Crichton until they were both pressed into the back of a limousine en route to its premiere, the author’s wild idea – that dinosaur DNA could be extracted from ancient preserved mosquitoes – lit the fuse for his next phase of research: could we really build a dinosaur? DNA breaks down fast, even in the belly of a mosquito, and the amount needed to create a dinosaur would be much more than palaeontologists could ever dream to find, Horner says. Still, there have been flashes of hope over the years, including the breakthrough discovery of soft tissue and intact blood proteins in a T-Rex bone by his student Mary Schweitzer. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction. Their genes still carry the building blocks of ancient dinosaurs – but many of their dino traits have been “turned off” over the course of evolution. But Horner has a Plan B: one he’s dubbed ""chickenosaurus"" for the school kids. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction. Their genes still carry the building blocks of ancient dinosaurs – but many of their dino traits have been “turned off” over the course of evolution. Just as there have been rare cases of humans born with a tail or a snake with legs, Horner’s plan is to flick back on the dormant lines of genetic code in a chicken. “We've found the genes we need to turn back on to change the head, the arms, the legs, to grow teeth,"" Horner says. ""But we can't figure out how to make the tail. That doesn't seem to be a [dormant or] atavistic gene."" That means the team will now have to turn to high-tech genetic engineering tools, likely the DNA editor CRISPR--Cas9, to finish the job and ""keep the fourth-graders happy"". ""But getting university backing to use a new tool like that, to create a novelty, it's not going to happen soon,"" Horner says. When it comes to solving the mystery of what killed the dinosaurs, meanwhile, scientists have almost closed the case. The suspect pool has now been mostly whittled down from volcanoes, toxic gases and even chronic constipation, to a world-shattering asteroid hit one June day 66 million years ago. The chunk of rock to blame was at least 10 kilometres wide and it hit with the force of more than a billion nuclear bombs, punching a hole in the Earth's crust in what is now the Gulf of Mexico. It also exposed, according to many in the field, the vulnerability of any biological empire on Earth – including humanity. With the world today facing threats from human-induced global warming and large-scale species extinction, and now another deadly virus, NASA has offered yet more sobering news: an asteroid almost as big as the dinosaur killer will shoot past Earth in a matter of weeks. We'll escape harm, but it'll be a near thing in astronomical terms. Horner says that while the importance of studying dinosaurs ""might still be lost on some people"" they can tell us more about the world than ever before, a glimpse into both evolution and extinction.

25,/national/we-re-not-running-out-of-dinosaurs-why-is-there-a-boom-in-finding-fossils-20200217-p541j2.html,'We're not running out of dinosaurs': Why is there a boom in fossils?,"Jack Horner, the palaeontologist who inspired the movie juggernaut Jurassic Park, found his first dinosaur bone when he was just eight. His father had seen something sticking out of the earth as he rode across the prairies of Montana, North America, long the heartland of dinosaur discovery, and it was there that he took little Jack fossil hunting. The bone still sits in Horner’s office today. The success of Jurassic Park in 1993 would launch a new generation of palaeontologists and an unprecedented boom for the field, opening up frontiers from Argentina to Australia and rewriting the story of the scaly monsters on screen. Within three years, on a hillside in China, a farmer had stumbled upon the world’s first glimpse of a feathered dinosaur. Today, close to one new dinosaur species is discovered every week. This year the big find to hit headlines is a new species, and likely a new genus, of tyrannosaur exhumed from the dust of Alberta, Canada, pictured above. Far from the image of the lumbering lizard doomed to extinction, palaeontologists now know dinosaurs as nature’s great success stories. In their 185-million-year reign on Earth, they weathered tremendous upheaval. Continents broke apart, volcanoes rained lava, temperatures and toxic gases climbed, monster wildfires scarred the land. Still dinosaurs spread to all its corners, growing to the size of passenger planes or emerging in strange new shapes including, eventually, as birds. In South America and Asia, whole new ecosystems are being unearthed, from huge spiked herbivores to strange bat-winged “vampires”. In outback Australia, a literal treasure trove of fossils has been found down an opal mine, many species preserved as vibrant gems. Now in another era of planetary change (this time of our own making), and with news from NASA that an asteroid nearly the size of the one that took out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago will soon sail hair-raisingly close to the Earth – what can we learn from these creatures? How has palaeontology evolved since Jurassic Park?  What discoveries have put Australia on the map? And will we ever bring a dinosaur back to life? An artist's reconstruction of thanatotheristes or the Reaper of Death, discovered this year.  Credit:Julius Csotonyi Horner sat next to director Steven Spielberg as a consultant on the set of Jurassic Park, and remembers well the hordes of students who suddenly signed up for his university classes after the film hit cinemas. But it wasn't a flash in the pan, says palaeontologist and author Steve Brusatte, who has himself helped discover somewhere in the order of 15 to 20 new dinosaurs. The students kept coming and today the resulting gold rush of discovery shows no signs of slowing down. ""We're not running out of dinosaurs,"" Brusatte laughs. Palaeontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza has tracked the rate of new finds since the first bones were unearthed in the 1800s, including that sudden surge. He too belongs to the Jurassic Park generation, the scientists ""who never grew up"", but says better technology is also speeding up dinosaur hunting as they compare finds online. Out in the field, Horner says the tools are still mostly what they were when he started. Dinosaur bones eventually become rock (and in some places, such as Australia, gem stone), which makes them nearly impossible to pick out from the landscape with scanners. Yet, back in the lab, X-rays, 3D printing, even molecular particle accelerators now come into play. ""And we can send drones out for us now to take pictures,” Horner says. All of those fresh eyes in the field can sometimes catch what has been missed. This year’s new tyrannosaur on the block gathered dust in a museum cabinet for almost a decade before PhD student Jared Voris decided to take a closer look. Now dubbed the Reaper of Death, the tyrannosaur is the oldest found in Canada. In life, it would have been about the length of two cars. ""We're confident it's a new genus as well as a new species,"" Voris says. ""The ridges in the jaw and the [shape of] the cheekbones are really different."" But sometimes, Horner warns, the hype can get ahead of the science. Many dinosaurs vary wildly in size and shape over their life cycle and baby dinosaurs have on occasion been ""discovered"" as their own separate species.

Credit:Royal Tyrrell Museum  To survive the tens of millions of years between death and discovery, dinosaur remains need cover from the elements. Most will decay completely but sometimes the conditions are just right for preservation - usually when an animal dies near water and is buried under sediment such as mud or silt. Water infused with minerals will seep into the hard, longer-wearing parts, the bones or teeth, as they break down, gradually replacing and encasing them. Over millennia, they are compressed into rock or ""fossil"". Sometimes other substances such as tar or ice can do an even better job of preserving the original remains, leading to remarkable discoveries such as intact feathers or even soft tissue. An artist's impression of the seven-metre-long Lightning Claw, the largest carnivorous dinosaur found in Australia. On Australia's west coast, some of the world's largest surviving dinosaur footprints are still in the rock, spanning almost two metres each. But it is on the east coast that most of Australia's fossil record is being dug up – and it's taken a “quantum leap forward” in the past few years, according to the Australian Museum. One hundred million years ago, in the last great age of dinosaurs known as the Cretaceous period, the dry continent was lush and green. Pterosaurs or “iron dragons” ruled the skies and ancient crocodiles shared hunting grounds with creatures such as Lightning Claw, pictured above, the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever found in Australia, with its ""grappling hooks"" for hands. Much of the east was swamped by a shallow inland sea – creating the perfect conditions for fossils. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove."" While our most complete dinosaur skeletons have come from Queensland, opal miners in remote NSW have stumbled upon the most beautiful. Down a mine shaft in Lightning Ridge is one of the richest fossil collections ever discovered from Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that once accounted for two-thirds of today’s land, including Australia. Here, dinosaur remains were buried under reactive minerals – glass or silica ash – from a chain of volcanoes erupting up north near the Great Barrier Reef at the time. Under the ""Martian-like"" conditions, the most unique opals in the world took shape in the rock – and in dinosaur bone. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove,” laughs Phil Bell, a palaeontologist at the University of New England. ""Some species have rich veins of colour through them, blues and reds."" Fossils have been picked out of opal hauls since mining began at the site in the 1900s – Australia's first prehistoric mammals were discovered there as well as some dinosaur species. But it’s hard work, climbing metres down rickety ladders into black chasms to dig with pick axes and jackhammers. Most of what’s been found has come off the back of the miners themselves. Even then, no one had studied the fossils in depth until 2013, when Bell ventured into the dark beneath Lightning Ridge and found a wealth of life, including Lightning Claw and an entire herd of the plant eater Fostoria. ""Not all of the bones are gem-quality, a lot are just the dark or opaque part of the opal, but some of those Fostoria bones do shimmer with the entire spectrum of colours,"" Bell says. ""These things are worth tens of thousands of dollars as jewellery but they're priceless as fossils."" An artist's impression of a Weewarrasaurus identified by Phil Bell and his team at Lightning Ridge in Australia.  Credit:James Kuether They are so precious that palaeontologists and the Australian Opal Centre are working with the local mining community to save them from commercial trade. When broken up for their gems, the fossils fetch a decent sum. But in a region hit hard by drought, they can bring more value, the argument goes, as a tourist attraction. ""Until Lightning Ridge, we'd been dealing with scraps from Victoria's coast and Queensland,"" Bell explains. ""We had those beautiful big [sauropod] tracks in Broome but that was our sole image of what dinosaurs in Australia looked like. Suddenly, here was this virtually untapped window into our past."" Paleontologist Phil Bell excavating for opalised fossils in the Lightning Ridge mine.Credit:Phil Bell It's not only scientists looking for dinosaurs. While ""bone wars"" have been raging since the 1800s, as paleontologists and collectors haggled over finds, the field's technology boom has also made it easier for black market traders to beat researchers to sites. Of course, a lot of dinosaur hunting depends on whose land you're on and regulation varies between countries and states. In Canada, all discoveries are the property of the Crown. In much of Australia and other parts of the world, if the bones are found on private land, they belong to that landowner. If they are held in a private collection, many paleontologists consider them scientifically worthless as they cannot be studied by others. Like a rare Rembrandt, T-Rex skeletons and other fossils are fast becoming status symbols and stolen bones routinely surface at high-profile auctions with forged paperwork. A bidding war reportedly broke out between actors Nicolas Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio over a $276,000 dinosaur skull. Cage won but had to return the skull in 2015 when it emerged it had been smuggled illegally out of Mongolia, a mecca for fossils but also a hot spot for dinosaur crime, Bell warns. He is one of a growing number of paleontologists now using hand-held Star-Trek style scanners ""a bit like hairdryers"" to trace the chemical fingerprints of bones and so help determine where they might have been poached from. In Australia, our rare opalised fossils cannot be exported without a permit (which are hard to come by). But their rarity makes them highly sought after on the black market.

Researchers hunt for clues that will tell them not just the kind of animal they've found but how it lived. Dinosaurs, like sharks, shed their teeth often, Bell says, and in sites such as Lightning Ridge, palaeontologists can piece together whole ecosystems. X-rays can help them look inside dinosaur brains and see where arteries once carved around the bones. Fossils can be 3D printed, and species run through the same engineering software used to test the structural integrity of dams and bridges to explore how they would have moved, if they could fly, the way T-Rex really handled those tiny arms.

28,/national/victoria/in-praise-of-mr-noot-noong-a-grandfather-and-those-born-to-teach-20200409-p54ij7.html,"In praise of Mr Noot Noong, a grandfather and those born to teach","Mr Noot Noong was born to teach. Only the worst thing in the world could stop him, and it did. Even then, it proved temporary. Replay   I thought of Noot Noong - and of my grandfather, once a teacher of unusual dedication too - as Australia, under assault from an insidious virus, wrestles over whether it should close its schools. It is a consequential decision for any nation to close schools, and not simply because parents are suddenly burdened with the responsibility of home tutoring and arranging their lives 24 hours a day around their children. Students today have computers and most of them have the internet at home, and in Victoria, Premier Dan Andrews has promised that those who lack these necessities will have them provided by the state. But links by video and the web cannot properly compensate students for being removed from the first-hand guidance of their teachers. Ever since 1872, when Victoria enacted the first legislation in the world to guarantee free, compulsory and secular education, we have been privileged enough to believe teachers and schools will simply be there for us. Until we are confronted with their absence. We could say the same about nurses and emergency doctors: they float somewhere at the edges of our consciousness until we need them, as we do now. Just as nurses and medicos and paramedics represent the hope of life itself, teachers and the schools in which they work represent the hope of the future. Some years ago I received a letter from an old man, gone from the Earth now. He was a stranger to me but he had achieved much during his life. He had been moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria and was a missionary to the poor in urban Australia before taking his energy to central and northern Australia, serving on the board of the Australian Inland Mission (established by John Flynn, founder of the Flying Doctor Service) and becoming the first executive officer of the Uniting Church of Northern Australia. His name was Frederick Bucknall. He wanted to tell me that he owed his life’s makings to the man who had taught him for four years from 1920 at a tiny school in the village of Drik Drik, in far south-west Victoria. Drik Drik school, built in 1873, a year after Victoria made education free, compulsory and secular. Here my grandfather introduced a small learning revolution. The teacher’s name was John Wallace Malseed, newly returned from the battles of the Western Front. “Wallace”, the letter told me, had introduced “a new educational theory called the Dalton system in which I, as a grade eight scholar, was given assignments to complete with him as tutor. He showed me how to research my information ... and I thrived educationally through the responsibility of working alone … Any scholastic achievement of mine, I owe in no small measure to my educational foundation by Wallace Malseed.” Malseed, who turned his back on the approved rote learning of the time and, having fought in history's most hideous war, brought a revolutionary plan that valued freedom and self-pacing to a bush school in 1920, was my grandfather. He took to farming, but valued learning all his life. When he was old and ailing, I presented him with a newborn daughter named Jessica. He welcomed her by quoting Lorenzo’s ode to Jessica from Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice: “Beshrew me but I love her heartily. For she is wise, if I can judge of her. And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.” Teachers, the best of them, are born to it. Which brings to mind Mr Noot Noong. I met him almost 30 years ago in a nondescript village north-west of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Every parent in the village wanted their children to attend Mr Noot Noong’s new school, we learned. All he lacked was chalk, textbooks, notebooks, pencils or any form of teaching aid. Later, in thanks for his village’s help in saving our colleague’s life, we showered him with American dollars, money that could have bought him a mountain of personal luxuries after his years of starvation.

Only the worst thing in the world could stop him, and it did. Even then, it proved temporary. Replay   I thought of Noot Noong - and of my grandfather, once a teacher of unusual dedication too - as Australia, under assault from an insidious virus, wrestles over whether it should close its schools. It is a consequential decision for any nation to close schools, and not simply because parents are suddenly burdened with the responsibility of home tutoring and arranging their lives 24 hours a day around their children. Students today have computers and most of them have the internet at home, and in Victoria, Premier Dan Andrews has promised that those who lack these necessities will have them provided by the state. But links by video and the web cannot properly compensate students for being removed from the first-hand guidance of their teachers. Ever since 1872, when Victoria enacted the first legislation in the world to guarantee free, compulsory and secular education, we have been privileged enough to believe teachers and schools will simply be there for us. Until we are confronted with their absence. We could say the same about nurses and emergency doctors: they float somewhere at the edges of our consciousness until we need them, as we do now. Just as nurses and medicos and paramedics represent the hope of life itself, teachers and the schools in which they work represent the hope of the future. Some years ago I received a letter from an old man, gone from the Earth now. He was a stranger to me but he had achieved much during his life. He had been moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria and was a missionary to the poor in urban Australia before taking his energy to central and northern Australia, serving on the board of the Australian Inland Mission (established by John Flynn, founder of the Flying Doctor Service) and becoming the first executive officer of the Uniting Church of Northern Australia. His name was Frederick Bucknall. He wanted to tell me that he owed his life’s makings to the man who had taught him for four years from 1920 at a tiny school in the village of Drik Drik, in far south-west Victoria. Drik Drik school, built in 1873, a year after Victoria made education free, compulsory and secular. Here my grandfather introduced a small learning revolution. The teacher’s name was John Wallace Malseed, newly returned from the battles of the Western Front. “Wallace”, the letter told me, had introduced “a new educational theory called the Dalton system in which I, as a grade eight scholar, was given assignments to complete with him as tutor. He showed me how to research my information ... and I thrived educationally through the responsibility of working alone … Any scholastic achievement of mine, I owe in no small measure to my educational foundation by Wallace Malseed.” Malseed, who turned his back on the approved rote learning of the time and, having fought in history's most hideous war, brought a revolutionary plan that valued freedom and self-pacing to a bush school in 1920, was my grandfather. He took to farming, but valued learning all his life. When he was old and ailing, I presented him with a newborn daughter named Jessica. He welcomed her by quoting Lorenzo’s ode to Jessica from Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice: “Beshrew me but I love her heartily. For she is wise, if I can judge of her. And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.” Teachers, the best of them, are born to it. Which brings to mind Mr Noot Noong. I met him almost 30 years ago in a nondescript village north-west of Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Here's a selection of what students had to say: It was only last year when we were learning about the Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics. Simply reading about it was distressing, especially with the unbelievably high death toll. And now here we are, less than a year later, self-isolating in our homes in an attempt to avoid the coronavirus outbreak. It feels as though our history textbooks have come to life, doesn’t it?Vania Zakerfathi, 14, Asquith Lola Christopoulos, 11, from Drummoyne.Credit:Lola Christopoulos 2020 began with blackened skies and a constant dangerous smoky haze as we dealt with the threat of the massive bushfires surrounding us in the Snowy Mountains. However, now we face a much bigger but invisible threat called COVID-19. Both of these events have had a tremendous impact on me and my family. I can only hope and hope again that the ski season is not cancelled as that might be too much to bear.Jock Harding, 14, East Jindabyne My mum is working so my dad helps me when I need it, but I find he much better suits his normal job as a fireman compared to teaching. I’ve got my own desk with my brother next to me and you can wear whatever you want. Today I am wearing a llama costume.Harriet Bowen, 7, Glenbrook Breaking News!This is the way my teacher would like me to start, whereas my Dad would probably like me to start with something like:Did you hear the joke about the germ? Never mind, I don’t want to spread it around.This is the kind of stuff that I have to put up with in class at home. Can you imagine, every five minutes, a joke that's not even worthy of being called a joke, each one worse than before? It's torture!Theodore Holmes, 11, Coffs Harbour Accidently called my teacher ‘Mum’ again but this time I was actually right! It’s been hard to win against the wall in handball, I would really rather play against my best buddies instead.Jaycob Diaz, 7, Stanhope Gardens For a generation hell-bent on staying within the confines of their screens, remote learning may be the worst thing that has happened to education. Maybe this will be beneficial for us after all – in a way that a son caught smoking his father’s cigarettes is forced to chain smoke the entire packet. We might just learn to appreciate the face-to-face contact we took for granted. Coughing and spluttering, we shall emerge from the mists of our poorly ventilated bedrooms to never look at our phones again.Ela Cimen, 17, Cabarita Rich class discussions, a large whiteboard and the opportunity to communicate face-to-face simply cannot be replaced by consecutive Zoom lessons. This experience is definitely the end of the “can robots replace teachers one day?” debate of our generation.Alisha Gugnani, 14, West Pennant Hills 'When you've figured out that home school is worse than regular school', by Oliver Doyle, age 10.Credit:Oliver Doyle When our teachers began running us through online lessons three weeks ago, I remember laughing with my classmates; pulling funny faces on the screens behind the teachers' backs. ""Remote learning"" was a phrase that sounded wacky and fun – almost a game. Fast forward to two weeks ago and there was a different feel; each lesson involved us demanding teachers opinions on the future, refreshing news websites on our laptops, hand-sanitiser replacing the spray perfumes in our pockets. That afternoon, it was announced that we would no longer be required to attend school. I cried that afternoon, and cried many more times to follow. I miss my friends, I miss my teachers, I miss the school bell, the morning roll call, the chatty corridors. I miss learning in an environment where I am constantly motivated and supported by my peers around me, where we learn collaboratively, sharing ideas, participating in hands-on activities.Isabel Vitoria, 17, Cromer At school everyone is packing up. All I can hear is the other kids' voices chattering away to their friends: “Isn't this exciting!” I got in the car with my Mum and said excitedly, ""This is going to be amazing"". How quickly things change. Missing friends. Only getting to see them on Google Meets, not in person. Missing school (which I never expected to miss) and feeling like I’ve left almost everything behind. My feelings soon turned into sadness, stress and fear, even though I was around my family. When I found out that I might be staying home for term two as well, I was devastated.Sienna Laura, 11, Roseville This was meant to be a special year, it marked the start of my high school life. I thought starting year 7 would be challenging but nothing has been as difficult as distance learning and the rapid spread of COVID-19. We all live in fear. To be told we’d have lessons from home made me very happy at first because I thought of the extra sleep and play time. For the first few days life was easy and breezy, but the novelty soon wore off. I found it tiring, lonely and hard. I also got in more trouble from my parents. I haven't left my house for 23 days. I miss everything from my old life.River Flores, 13, Dural How amazing is it? No need to walk to school, get sweaty and carry heavy bags around. And on top of that, no PE! It was a yay for me – well unfortunately only for the first few days. Tasks pelted down like bullets, assessments, worksheets and what-not. Remote learning is secluded and I hope we never have to do remote learning again. A shout out to our spectacular teachers, they are toiling day and night for our learning.Nashrah Nusaibah, 15, Asquith Sleeping in until five minutes before the roll. Going to school in my pyjamas. Sitting next to my dog all day. Home schooling was going to be great! That was before I realised what it was really like. No one to talk to in class. No one to play with in the backyard. No sport or going to the library. Just me and a computer screen. Also, the teachers will not let you wear your pyjamas after all!Anna Slack, 8, Hunters Hill Although at the beginning I thought I would like doing my lessons at home, two weeks in I am finding it unbearable. It's like a feeling I can’t explain. I am an only child so not being at school and seeing other children is huge. I really miss the people. The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren’t for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself … Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It’s the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it’s like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn’t have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we’ve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon – and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I’m still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can’t help but be sad that we’re missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I’ve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I’m constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn’t fill me with motivation. I’m not a super eager student and I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can’t see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can’t pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can’t hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

The only good thing about learning at home is you can eat in class and wear comfy clothes instead of your school uniform and if you’re feeling lazy you don’t have to brush your hair.Clementine Balfas Bell, 11, Newtown Drawings of life in isolation by Alice Glen, 12. Credit:Alice Glen I miss the journey to and from school. I would usually walk to the station, catch the train, then the bus. I miss the clamour, the pushing, and everything that comes with catching public transport. I miss talking to my friends and saying hello to everyone in the hallways. I can’t socialise anymore. The hardest part of staying home is being in a small home with four other people. I have to share a space for studying with my brother, and it can get really loud. Additionally, because English is my mum’s second language, when my younger sister needs help with her work, she comes to me, often when I’m on call, and whilst I’m explaining to her what to do, I would miss what I have to do.Sienna Jeong, 14, Asquith I've got a few things that I miss about the school and that is playing soccer and having fun with my friends. I also miss not getting merit cards and awards. I enjoy being in bed a bit longer and visit my mummy and daddy in the morning. I get to have fun on the iPad doing my school activities. At lunch I play with my dad – Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch – and my dad always wins 🙁Raushan Settels, 6, Hurstville Who would have thought that 53 minutes could seem so long? Without friends to talk to and collaborate with, one period seems to stretch on forever. I never realised how much I would miss talking to my friends in class, even if it was just asking the meaning of a word or something else mundane.Jemma Simpson, 13, Northmead Eleanor Park, 10, from SilverwaterCredit:Eleanor Park Thank you coronavirus! Home schooling is the best! You get to spend way more time with your family, play tonnes of soccer in the backyard, go for afternoon walks, eat yummy hot lunches instead of vegemite sandwiches, and stay in your PJs. I’ve achieved two amazing things in my two weeks of home schooling – I’ve learnt to draw! Something I’ve been too afraid to learn in class and best of all, I’ve broken my soccer juggling record – I can now do 100 juggles!Darcy McNicholas, 9, North Epping The nice thing about staying at home is that I can sleep in. I don't have to get up at 6.30am anymore. YAY!! We still have fun at home. Every morning we ride around the block so it feels like we are riding to school. Then we do some exercise before we start our school work. We also have a canteen on Friday. We collect points by doing jobs, then we spend the points at the canteen. Last week I chose Arancini Balls. Yum!Harper Sacoor, 10, North Narooma When I first heard the words home schooling, I thought this meant my dad dressing up as a smart person and teaching me stuff. Turns out it was kind of different. For starters, it felt awkward. But there was a good side too – NO RULES!!!! Actually, I learn more at home. And I still get taught by my teacher. I also think it is kind of cool that I can stay in my PJs and go to school.Leon George, 8, Hornsby I think I've gotten used to it. I have a to-do list so I know what to do during the day. I miss my classmates, but we do video chats. Today we had a video chat to sing happy birthday to a classmate. But we couldn't have any of his birthday cake.Aoi McMahon, 6, Bronte I like working from home because I can eat peanut butter and I can work with mummy. I miss playing with my friends, because I only have my baby brother to play with. The best part of being at home is I don’t get in as much trouble. The things I find hard is knowing what to do when it’s lunch and my brother is sleeping. Also sitting properly.Rosalind Galea, 7, Yagoona In my opinion, home schooling is great. You get to pick when you do a certain subject, eat when you want and decide what to play at lunch. The only real problem is being tormented by your siblings! I have an older sister who drives me up the wall. Some people can be embarrassed by their sibling’s teasing, but it doesn’t matter because she has more homework to do than me.Rafaella Tambasco, 8, Dulwich Hill 'Home schooling is the worst' by Jasmine Pastorelli, aged 8.Credit:Jasmine Pastorelli As each day crawls by like a snail in the rain, I feel helpless and trapped. I feel like I am stranded in a cramped room with four walls in each direction charging towards me. Every child in any corner of the globe would do anything to just spend one day in school, including me. I miss just slipping into my uniform, pinning on my badge and walking proudly to school, thriving with my friends. But every night when I close my eyes, I know we are running this race together. I know that the sun will still rise tomorrow. Most importantly, I know that next day when we wake up, we are one day closer to the finish line.Ritisha Roy, 11, Mays Hill I am having problems with computers doing lessons at home. I use my sister's old laptop, but it’s slow and can barely connect to the internet. This afternoon when I had almost finished a 1000-word story, my laptop screen stopped working again. I would have cried, but my Dad was in an online meeting and I didn’t want to disturb him.Clementine Roumanoff, 9, North Balgowlah Being home schooled is the worst. The only good bits about it are PJ lessons, going for lunchtime walks and bike rides, and writing letters to my friends. The hardest part about being at home school is watching the postman ride by each day and not getting any letters in reply. Also, learning my times tables and about the First Fleet is sooooo boring. The thing I miss the most about going to school is seeing my friends every day. I miss their smiles and hugs.Scarlett Frost, 7, West Pennant Hills Having ADHD, it feels harder than ever to concentrate on work when I’m not surrounded by peers. We’re forced to find our own initiative to learn, which is difficult considering how the current circumstances are only draining us of motivation and optimism. It’s starting to take a toll on me, and I know I’m not the only one.Mia Skjellerup, 14, Turramurra I never really knew what isolation meant. But here I am, 9-years-old, living through a period of time that will be studied by lots of kids my age one day. It feels so comforting seeing my teachers' and friends' faces through my computer screen, hearing their voices for a few moments. It keeps my mind from thinking about all the sad things happening right now. But some thoughts never leave my mind, like will my grandparents be OK?Hannah Chalmers, 9, Rodd Point  Many people say teenagers are the most social age group, so being confined within the walls of our houses is torturous. We just want to go to school and socialise, or go to the shops on the weekend. Only yesterday we were looking back on photos from before the quarantine and wondering what we would be doing today if it weren’t for the virus. It's like a whole year of our childhood is gone, a year we can never get back.John Maskery, 15, Wahroonga I'm transforming into an indolent, fatigued pig, sitting down for six hours straight and staring at my computer screen until I have accomplished my assignments. I miss going out to enjoy the sun, spending quality time with friends. I miss seeing their sweet and alluring smiles and laughing hysterically with them. I'm so grateful and thankful to all the doctors and nurses risking their valuable lives to help save others.Angelina Zhao, 14, Burwood Life in isolation drawing by Taliesin Law.Credit:Taliesin Law We are the class of 2020. We will be remembered as the ones who spent half their graduation year locked inside their houses instead of in the school musical, swimming in the last carnival or pulling senior pranks. Year 12 is a big year for anyone but when you are doing your lessons through a screen, receiving new information about the HSC every day, and unsure if the next time you will see your friends is when you are walking up to collect the certificate that says you passed year 12, you begin to ask yourself … Did I pass year 12? Or did I just pass a test? Because year 12 is not the final mark. It’s the friends along the way, the memories you make and the stories you tell 10 years from now. The class of 2020 will go down in the books, but every single one of us would prefer to have made the memories than to be remembered in that book of missed opportunities.Georgia Prendergast, 17, West Pymble For year 12s I think it’s like graduation came, but too soon and without any of the celebration; no one was expecting it and we didn’t have the chance to say our goodbyes to the experiences, good and bad, that we’ve had over the last 13 years. Hopefully we will get that chance soon – and I think I speak for many students when I say we are so grateful for our teachers at the moment.Lauren Shaw, 17, Croydon Park No longer am I able to enjoy the constant stream of worksheets by chatting to my classmates, or find motivation from the girl in front of me who's three chapters ahead in the textbook. I’m still in touch with all my friends and probably talking to them more now then I did before, sometimes calling them and just leaving them on speaker next to me, so I can hear their occasional singing or complaints of our work that seems to have doubled in nature. But I can’t help but be sad that we’re missing out on our final year of school. I worry about the question mark that hangs around our graduation and year 12 fun days I’ve watched others experience for the past five years, waiting desperately for my turn. Particularly I think about my HSC. Even though I’m constantly told to keep studying, its uncertain nature doesn’t fill me with motivation. I’m not a super eager student and I never thought I’d say it, but I miss going to school.Sophie Mumford, 17, Cheltenham Drawing of learning at home by Hannah Lemon, year 9.Credit:Hannah Lemon As you know, all Australian students are required to learn from home. I think it's the right action but just not the most fun. If you ask me it lacks LIFE:Learning is incomplete, lacking teachers guidance and the way they used to check what we're doing.Interaction is less to none online, as you can only message or text each other.Friends, there are none with me! Learning from home breaks are the most boring things ever.Extra-curricular activities. In school there are various activities you can do and be part of, however at home there are limited options.With this I would like to conclude, as School has all the LIFE, I can't wait for it to start again!Tanvi Marwaha, 9, Baulkham Hills Unlucky that I still have to wear my official school uniform shirt for online live classes, but lucky that the teachers can’t see lower because I only have my PJ pants on still. Unlucky that I can’t pick out something yum at the canteen during break, but lucky that I get to have lunch with my little brother like in school holidays. Unlucky that school camp was cancelled, but lucky that I met some great new friends in the first few weeks of high school. Unlucky that I can’t hang out with my mates every day, but lucky that I have extra time with my family and that they are all safe.Lachlan Diaz-Brand, 12, Toongabbie It started as a whisper, a single strain,Our authorities claimed they had it tamed,But as panic spread and shelves became bare,Australians became divided, everyone, everywhere,And as the online transition slowly began,Social gatherings were limited, travel banned. Our activities ended, our sports and bands,Headphones replaced our outstretched hands,Our classrooms substituted for virtual screens,Our days spent, watery eyes glued to teams,Our lunchtimes enjoyed, indoors, and alone,Our only interaction through the screen of a phone. Our teachers check in regularly, their pixelated faces a welcome sight,Confined to the house with our siblings, trying not to fight,Our evenings spent listening attentively to the ABC,While we realise how lucky we were before, when we were free. So as our nation enters into uncharted waters,We must keep our family close, our dads, mums, sons and daughters,We must strive to do right by others and be kind,And be willing to change our daily life, and keep an open mind. So whether it is making simple sacrifices, like working from home or school online,We must work together as a nation, for it is when Australia is unified that we truly shine.Ben Cullen, 15, Westleigh Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day’s crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

The university, in Melbourne’s east, said it would ensure students had options beyond the traditional competitive ranking system when it came to gaining entry to tertiary study next year. Swinburne University will delay the start of semester one next year.  The move comes after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on Tuesday he would ask universities to delay the start of the academic year, following his government’s decision to push back end-of-year exams until December or even January. The exams are a major determinant of a VCE student’s study score and Australian Tertiary Admission Rank – the competitive ranking system universities use as a gauge to control entry into many courses. Swinburne committed on Wednesday to delay the start of semester one next year “to coincide with any changes made by the government to year 12”. “This is to accommodate the shift in VCE timelines for year 12 students in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 situation,” a university spokesperson said. The university also said it would offer this year’s crop of year 12 students places based on their year 11 and year 12 work. “We will be sharing details of our approach with secondary schools later in 2020,” the spokesperson said. Swinburne is the first Victorian university to publicly commit to altering its admissions process for domestic students next year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. School students learned this week that all of term two would be taught remotely. Victoria University will guarantee a place for students based on their year 11 results, if the student resides in Melbourne's western suburbs, part of its ""VU guarantee"". Interstate institutions, including the Australian National University and the University of Western Australia, have also committed to changing their admissions processes, including allowing students to apply based on a predicted ATAR derived from their year 11 results. Peter Hurley, policy fellow at Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute, said all universities would have to broaden their admissions criteria next year in response to COVID-19, including looking beyond the ATAR as the benchmark. “There is an idea that the ATAR is the only way into university and it is not,” Mr Hurley said. “There are lots of different pathways into university and often ATARs reflect student family background and socio-economic status.” Schools also liked to use the ATAR to trumpet their students’ superior academic results compared with other schools, he said. “We can do without that for a year, can’t we?” Other major Victorian universities said they were still assessing their response to the disruption. La Trobe University said it was “actively developing a range of options to support prospective students to enter university study in addition to the traditional ATAR based entry options”. Deakin University’s deputy vice-chancellor Professor Liz Johnson said the regional university “will ensure VCE students have a clear and supported pathway to study in 2021”. The University of Melbourne said it would consider options for its admissions processes after it learned more about changes to year 12 certificates in other states.

Although a figure has not been set, councillors have asked staff to develop ways to financially support overseas students, many of whom have lost casual jobs in retail and hospitality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are about 200,000 overses students in Melbourne.Credit:Joe Armao They have also backed calls by the International Education Association of Australia for a hardship fund for foreign students, which could take contributions from the council, other levels of government, universities and the private sector. On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said international students and other visa holders were ""not held here compulsorily"". ""If they're not in a position to be able to support themselves, then there is the alternative for them to return to their home countries,"" he said. ""At this time, Australia must focus on its citizens and its residents to ensure that we can maximise the economic supports that we have."" Replay   The following day Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said international students had been a terrific contributor to Australia, supporting Australian jobs. ""We want them to stay here where they can support themselves,"" he said. He said the government was providing additional flexibility for them to support themselves and was continuing to work with the international education sector on future arrangements. Mr Tudge said international students working in aged care, as nurses and in major supermarkets had had the hours they were allowed to work every fortnight extended to support these critical sectors. On Tuesday night, the council voted to ask staff to develop further measures to support international students financially and in kind during this time. “Contrary to reports from other levels of government, not only do we welcome international students to our city, but we hope that they remain here with us in our comparatively safe country during these dangerous times,” Cr Jackie Watts said. She said the Prime Minister’s comments were “clearly counterproductive on a number of levels”. “The alarm and anxiety amongst international students is real and growing and they need reassurance that we value them and are endeavouring to keep them safe with us in Melbourne,” Cr Watts said. Melbourne is home to 200,000 international students from 170 countries, including 52,000 international students who live or study in the central city. International education is the state’s biggest export earner, contributing $12 billion to the Victorian economy last year. International students are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week but many have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 shutdown and are not eligible for government welfare or the new JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes. “It’s an appalling way to treat people who have made a considerable investment in our economy,” said the association's chief executive Phil Honeywood. By contrast, he said New Zealand had allowed international students access to the equivalent of their JobKeeper scheme, provided them with free health services and automatically extended student visas until December. “We are not in the ballpark when it comes to showing humanity and support for these young people.” He said international students were not able to return home in many cases because flights to their country had been grounded or the cost was prohibitively high. “We are going to have a situation in the next couple of weeks in the absence of any support where we will have footage of international students in the streets,” Mr Honeywood said. “I congratulate Melbourne City Council on being the first local government in Australia to commit to this vital issue.” The council also agreed to establish a free resume checking service for international students, deliver programs to international students online and match international students affected by the pandemic with local startups.

Victorian students learnt on Tuesday that they will have to wait until at least term three to return to face-to-face classes, with term two lessons happening remotely for all except those students who must be at school. Year 12 students Kezzia Chan (foreground) and Sylvia Griffin. Credit:Joe Armao The uncertainty has hit VCE students hardest. The Victorian government hopes schools will be able to hold end-of-year exams in December instead of through October and November.

The lack of clarity about how the most important year of their schooling will work has left many year 12 students frustrated and upset. Peter Goss, the Grattan Institute’s education fellow, said this year’s crop of year 12s would be disadvantaged even further if the school year was not extended.  “School isn’t just about turning up; school is for learning,” Dr Goss said. “We should be aiming for students to have as good a year of learning in 2020 as possible to set them up for whatever they do in 2021. “One way to do that is by extending the school year, given that so much of the year will be disrupted and the evidence strongly suggests that students on average learn less through online learning than face-to-face.” He also said it was likely that students from  disadvantaged backgrounds would fall even further behind, due to a lack of effective support at home. Madeleine Pirruccio, a year 12 student at Santa Maria College in Northcote, said she was “feeling frustrated” and would rather finish the school year at the normal time, even if it meant missing out on an ATAR. “We feel we have been robbed of our final year of schooling by the cancellation of athletics carnivals, formals and 18th birthdays and would rather finish this year and have summer to make up for our lost time, making memories,” she says.

40,/national/victoria/victorian-coronavirus-death-toll-climbs-to-13-20200410-p54ium.html,Victorian coronavirus death toll climbs to 13,"Victoria registered its 13th coronavirus death on Thursday, an 80-year-old man who died in hospital, as another 13 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, taking the statewide total to 1241. The total number of cases includes 650 men and 591 women, ranging in age from babies to people in their early 90s. Replay   Of the 1241 cases, 1001 are in Melbourne and 229 are in the regions while several other cases remain under investigation. Thirteen people remain in intensive care and another 30 are in hospital, after seven patients were released on Thursday. The latest figures were released as the state government announced packages to help vulnerable people isolate if they are diagnosed or exposed to the virus. Prevention of Family Violence Minister Gabrielle Williams announced a $40.2 million package to support women and children. Of that total figure, $20 million will be put toward short-term housing for survivors needing somewhere safe to isolate or recover. Ms Williams said the accommodation would be similar to quarantine hotels for returned travellers and healthcare workers. The funding will go to support services, with domestic violence expected to worsen during the pandemic as families remain housebound. There has not yet been a spike in domestic violence, but it is expected to come. ""We know that that's been borne out overseas and we've got no reason to expect any different, sadly,"" Ms Williams said. There was a drop in calls for help at the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions. Experts believe that may be because survivors have less opportunity to call for help while everyone is at home. The funding includes almost $5 million for new technology and protective equipment for up to 120 family violence and sexual assault organisations, and funding for Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations. Housing Minister Richard Wynne also announced an $8.8 million homelessness package to establish four pop-up housing sites around Melbourne using repurposed aged-care homes. The accommodation can house up to 200 homeless people who are diagnosed or suspected to have coronavirus. ""We know they can't self isolate and they can't quarantine themselves,"" Mr Wynne said. St Vincent's Hospital staff will provide 24/7 healthcare at the facilities, which will be funded for six months. So far, 926 people have recovered from coronavirus, including 120 over the last 24 hours. There have been 116 cases of community transmission, with no known contact with a confirmed case or overseas travel, six more than a day ago. Victorians have been tested 62,000 times, with testing criteria widened this week for frontline workers and vulnerable people. Staff at seven hospitals and one radiology unit have been diagnosed, with 157 healthcare workers testing positive in the state so far.

No round-the-clock TV broadcasts. And no rattling tins at busy intersections. But organisers of the popular Good Friday Appeal, which raises millions of dollars every Easter for the Royal Children's Hospital, are hoping Victorians will still dig deep – virtually. Royal Children's Hospital.Credit:Darrian Traynor Anne Randall, director of the fundraiser, said around $152,000 had been raised by 9.15am on Good Friday. But she conceded this year's fundraising – which follows devastating bushfires across the country and falls in the middle of a global pandemic – would not be their biggest year of fundraising. ""We've had to move a lot of our activities online, which has actually worked pretty well for us,"" Ms Randall told radio station 3AW. ""We're not expected to break any records, but we know the Victorian community is very generous and they will donate as much as they can afford to. ""It's been a tough year with the bushfires and now the pandemic, so we're just hoping for the best result."" Country firefighters, who have helped the fundraiser since 1951, are doing their own ""Virtual Tin Shake"" for the hospital this year, so towns can still compete to raise the most. At least 160 CFA brigades have registered. Last year, the firefighters raised $1.6 million for the Royal Children's Hospital. “We are so touched by the support our members show for the Good Friday Appeal every year,” CFA Chief Officer Steve Warrington said. “I’d also like to acknowledge the incredible support shown by the Victorian community during the recent bushfire crisis. We are so grateful for those who might still donate to the appeal amid the current circumstances – every little bit counts."" Regular Easter fundraising events have been cancelled around the state as a result of the stage three restrictions to slow coronavirus infections, including the Kids Day Out, Run for the Kids, Cadbury Easter Egg Hunt and AFL Kick for the Kids match. Usually, the telethon is broadcast on Channel 7 throughout the day. This Good Friday, a one-hour Good Friday Appeal Special will air from 7pm. Supporters can donate at any time online or donate to the Country Fire Authority's virtual tin shake. The Good Friday appeal has been raising money for the Royal Children's Hospital for 89 years.

Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services were designed for, with the former emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online and the latter optimised for business meetings. Maureen Jacotine 86 year old resident of Uniting's Aldersgate aged care facility began crying while speaking with her family via Zoom. Credit:SMH While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, Tim Biggs has some tips to stay safe. For Zoom: Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet, they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. For Houseparty: You're likely to end up with a very diverse list of friends, so it's important to get to know the ""lock"" feature. Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. Health officials are expected to visit two quarantine hotels in Perth after claims security guards were instructed to remove personal protection face masks because they were “upsetting and intimidating” guests. CBD hotels the Duxton and Pan Pacific are being used to isolate hundreds of interstate and overseas travellers for a mandatory 14-day period to help manage the spread of COVID-19. Serco was given responsibility to provide security at the Duxton but contracted the work to Perth-based Corporate Security Australia. Health Minister Roger Cook said the WA government expected all contractors to ensure their workers were suitably protected. Security guards working in two quarantine Perth hotels have been instructed to remove their masks. Credit:Getty “If there is a risk to their workers by not providing them with PPE, that’s not good enough,” he told reporters. United Workers Union state secretary Carolyn Smith said dozens of security guards at the Duxton and Pan Pacific were now at greater risk after site supervisors instructed them to remove masks for the sake of quarantined hotel guests. “We’ve seen incidents with people trying to leave the quarantine … and what stands between that happening and threatening the WA population is our workers,” she said. Approximately 10 security guards work 12-hour shifts on each floor housing guests subject to forced government quarantine, hotel cleaners are also regularly operating in those areas. “Being handed a mask and then having that mask taken away when working in a high-risk environment is unacceptable and reckless in the current health crisis,” Ms Smith said. “These hotels are housing people at risk of coronavirus. These security guards do have contact with guests, they are working at lifts, in hallways and lobbies. “We don’t believe for a minute that guests in a hotel under quarantine would be intimidated by PPE, and would want to be seeing all workers taking precautions.” Masks, gloves and hand sanitiser were issued to guards by Corporate Security at the beginning of shifts but site supervisors soon told them to remove them because they would “upset and intimidate the guests staying there”, the union said. “One of our members was so concerned at the directive and the health and safety implications that she resigned her position,” Ms Smith said. Perth Airport has closed Terminal 1 Domestic Pier to the general public until further notice after Virgin Australia moved to temporarily suspend interstate flights this week.  Virgin announced on Thursday they would be suspending all of their domestic flights from Friday, except a return service between Sydney and Melbourne running daily except Saturdays. Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the current health crisis. The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked the government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Announcing the news on social media, Perth Airport said Virgin's regional flights departing from Terminal 2 to transport FIFO workers would not be impacted. Beaches along the Perth coast are already packed as police warn people who flock to the coast on a scorching Good Friday to follow strict social distancing measures. Two police helicopters were watching beachgoers closely every five minutes.

Beaches in Sorrento and Hillarys were packed by 10am on Friday.Credit:David Prestipino Carparks at Hillarys Boat Harbour and Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club were already full while a flurry of cyclists, runners and walkers flooded the pedestrian footpath on West Coast Drive. The government has so far stopped short of closing popular swimming spots to combat COVID-19 but police on Friday warned beachgoers they risked being charged or forcing authorities to close beaches if distancing guidelines weren't adhered to. Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel told 6PR's Mornings with Gareth Parker beaches would be closed if people did not comply with the measures ahead of two days forecast to reach the high 30s. ""If people do the right thing then there'll be no need to do that ... that might be a step we've got to go to if people do break the rules,"" he said. ""If you don't stop movement, we can't slow the spread... so before you decide to head down to the beach or undertake activity, our advice to people is to stay at home, and stay safe if you can."" Police will monitor activity along the coast and other gathering hot spots over the Easter long weekend and crack down on those flouting the rules. ""We have a number of police targeting those areas over the weekend; beaches, carparks, parks and other locations where people traditionally gather over Easter,"" he said. ""Police monitoring won't be punitive, it will be measured... but people who blatantly disregard the law, who blatantly disregard the good work the community is doing, could be charged. ""By all means go for a swim, go for a surf, go for a run, but you don't need to be down there all day."" The warning comes after several councils along Perth’s coastline urged beachgoers to “keep their distance”, with some even closing access to popular beaches. The City of Mandurah last Tuesday announced they would restrict vehicle access to White Hills and Tims Thicket, two popular fishing spots, to “stop the spread of COVID-19”. Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt also encouraged locals to go for a swim or a walk so long as they stayed at least 1.5 metres from others. “When you’re done with your swim, run or walk, don’t linger – go home,” he said. WA Premier Mark McGowan has issued a heartfelt message thanking all  West Australians working over the long Easter weekend and asking families to ""spare a thought"" for those on duty.  ""There’s going to be West Australians keeping shelves stocked and keeping us alive in ICUs,"" he said. ""There’s going to be West Australians at border checkpoints and looking after the people in isolation facilities across the state. ""Responding to emergencies, dishing up takeaway, on our wharves, driving trucks, on a mine site, working in aged care. Not to mention keeping our workplaces clean and disinfected. ""All over this great state, West Australians will be keeping things running, and holding this pandemic at bay. ""To them, we say thank you.""   If you're just catching up on news late this morning, here are the most recent updates from overseas: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning the UN Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security, ""potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease."" China on Friday reported 42 new cases, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. California saw its first daily decrease in intensive care hospitalisations during the coronavirus outbreak, a key indicator of how many health care workers and medical supplies the state needs, Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday (US time). As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city's public cemetery. Italy has banned foreign-flagged migrant rescue ships from docking in its ports because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Malta has said it can no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency. The British government's two chief advisers on the coronavirus pandemic voiced cautious optimism that the country's outbreak may be near its peak even as the COVID-19 death toll rose sharply to just shy of 8000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care. Germany's national disease control centre says it plans to conduct a series of blood tests to determine how many people in the country are immune to COVID-19 and how many were infected without knowing it. Iran's supreme leader suggested Thursday that mass gatherings may be barred through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it believes at least 35 Iranian prisoners were killed by security forces suppressing riots by inmates over the virus.

News updates will also be shared on Facebook, Twitter and ABC radio.  Families that can't see each other in person for Easter celebrations this weekend have been turning to video services like Zoom and Houseparty to see loved ones' faces and share stories of isolation. The platform agnostic video services have become indispensable tools for staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues. But this isn't exactly what the services were designed for, with the former emphasising open socialisation with whoever happens to be online and the latter optimised for business meetings.

Credit:SMH While the two services are moving quickly to adapt to their new role as mainstream communication tools there are some privacy and security considerations you might not expect. If you're just getting started with either of these apps, Tim Biggs has some tips to stay safe. For Zoom: Do not post the details of your meeting on Facebook or Twitter, or anywhere on the internet, they might be seen by anyone other than the intended attendees. For Houseparty: You're likely to end up with a very diverse list of friends, so it's important to get to know the ""lock"" feature. Consider downloading the app yourself and asking your kid to add you; that way you can always check in to see who they're in a room with. Health officials are expected to visit two quarantine hotels in Perth after claims security guards were instructed to remove personal protection face masks because they were “upsetting and intimidating” guests. CBD hotels the Duxton and Pan Pacific are being used to isolate hundreds of interstate and overseas travellers for a mandatory 14-day period to help manage the spread of COVID-19. Serco was given responsibility to provide security at the Duxton but contracted the work to Perth-based Corporate Security Australia. Health Minister Roger Cook said the WA government expected all contractors to ensure their workers were suitably protected.

United Workers Union state secretary Carolyn Smith said dozens of security guards at the Duxton and Pan Pacific were now at greater risk after site supervisors instructed them to remove masks for the sake of quarantined hotel guests. “We’ve seen incidents with people trying to leave the quarantine … and what stands between that happening and threatening the WA population is our workers,” she said. Approximately 10 security guards work 12-hour shifts on each floor housing guests subject to forced government quarantine, hotel cleaners are also regularly operating in those areas. “Being handed a mask and then having that mask taken away when working in a high-risk environment is unacceptable and reckless in the current health crisis,” Ms Smith said. “These hotels are housing people at risk of coronavirus. These security guards do have contact with guests, they are working at lifts, in hallways and lobbies. “We don’t believe for a minute that guests in a hotel under quarantine would be intimidated by PPE, and would want to be seeing all workers taking precautions.” Masks, gloves and hand sanitiser were issued to guards by Corporate Security at the beginning of shifts but site supervisors soon told them to remove them because they would “upset and intimidate the guests staying there”, the union said. “One of our members was so concerned at the directive and the health and safety implications that she resigned her position,” Ms Smith said. Perth Airport has closed Terminal 1 Domestic Pier to the general public until further notice after Virgin Australia moved to temporarily suspend interstate flights this week.  Virgin announced on Thursday they would be suspending all of their domestic flights from Friday, except a return service between Sydney and Melbourne running daily except Saturdays. Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the current health crisis. The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked the government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Announcing the news on social media, Perth Airport said Virgin's regional flights departing from Terminal 2 to transport FIFO workers would not be impacted. Beaches along the Perth coast are already packed as police warn people who flock to the coast on a scorching Good Friday to follow strict social distancing measures. Two police helicopters were watching beachgoers closely every five minutes.

The government has so far stopped short of closing popular swimming spots to combat COVID-19 but police on Friday warned beachgoers they risked being charged or forcing authorities to close beaches if distancing guidelines weren't adhered to. Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel told 6PR's Mornings with Gareth Parker beaches would be closed if people did not comply with the measures ahead of two days forecast to reach the high 30s. ""If people do the right thing then there'll be no need to do that ... that might be a step we've got to go to if people do break the rules,"" he said. ""If you don't stop movement, we can't slow the spread... so before you decide to head down to the beach or undertake activity, our advice to people is to stay at home, and stay safe if you can."" Police will monitor activity along the coast and other gathering hot spots over the Easter long weekend and crack down on those flouting the rules. ""We have a number of police targeting those areas over the weekend; beaches, carparks, parks and other locations where people traditionally gather over Easter,"" he said. ""Police monitoring won't be punitive, it will be measured... but people who blatantly disregard the law, who blatantly disregard the good work the community is doing, could be charged. ""By all means go for a swim, go for a surf, go for a run, but you don't need to be down there all day."" The warning comes after several councils along Perth’s coastline urged beachgoers to “keep their distance”, with some even closing access to popular beaches. The City of Mandurah last Tuesday announced they would restrict vehicle access to White Hills and Tims Thicket, two popular fishing spots, to “stop the spread of COVID-19”. Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt also encouraged locals to go for a swim or a walk so long as they stayed at least 1.5 metres from others. “When you’re done with your swim, run or walk, don’t linger – go home,” he said. WA Premier Mark McGowan has issued a heartfelt message thanking all  West Australians working over the long Easter weekend and asking families to ""spare a thought"" for those on duty.  ""There’s going to be West Australians keeping shelves stocked and keeping us alive in ICUs,"" he said. ""There’s going to be West Australians at border checkpoints and looking after the people in isolation facilities across the state. ""Responding to emergencies, dishing up takeaway, on our wharves, driving trucks, on a mine site, working in aged care. Not to mention keeping our workplaces clean and disinfected. ""All over this great state, West Australians will be keeping things running, and holding this pandemic at bay. ""To them, we say thank you.""   If you're just catching up on news late this morning, here are the most recent updates from overseas: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning the UN Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security, ""potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease."" China on Friday reported 42 new cases, 38 of them imported, along with one additional death in the hardest-hit city of Wuhan. California saw its first daily decrease in intensive care hospitalisations during the coronavirus outbreak, a key indicator of how many health care workers and medical supplies the state needs, Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday (US time). As New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the amount of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in the city's public cemetery. Italy has banned foreign-flagged migrant rescue ships from docking in its ports because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Malta has said it can no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency. The British government's two chief advisers on the coronavirus pandemic voiced cautious optimism that the country's outbreak may be near its peak even as the COVID-19 death toll rose sharply to just shy of 8000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care. Germany's national disease control centre says it plans to conduct a series of blood tests to determine how many people in the country are immune to COVID-19 and how many were infected without knowing it. Iran's supreme leader suggested Thursday that mass gatherings may be barred through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it believes at least 35 Iranian prisoners were killed by security forces suppressing riots by inmates over the virus.

As some inner-city councils roll out multi-million dollar relief packages, some local governments in regional WA are warning they could run out of money within months. Council across Perth face a sharp fall in revenue as costs rise due to the coronavirus pandemic.Credit:Erin Jonasson In a further blow, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed local governments are ineligible for wage subsidies through the federal government's JobKeeper package, saying additional support should come from individual states. But to date, the WA government has refused to throw a lifeline to struggling local governments, despite desperate calls for debt relief and a deferral of the gross rental value revaluation. The City of Perth, one of the state's wealthiest councils, estimates revenue will drop by about $17 million in the next few months, leaving them to run at a small operating profit by the end of the financial year. In Mandurah, the council anticipates it could lose up to $3.5 million. Other councils such as Stirling and Fremantle are still trying to calculate their exact losses but estimate them to be in the order of tens of millions of dollars. Most local governments have waived parking and other charges to assist small businesses and residents, while also closing pools, venues and other facilities from which they derive revenue. Also adding financial pressure to the state's nearly 140 councils is a growing number of ratepayers seeking to defer their rates over the coming months due to financial hardship. Earlier this week, the local governments in Mandurah and Geraldton revealed they had stood down more than 200 staff members as revenue streams dried up. The City of Mandurah alone temporarily stood down 95 full-time and part-time workers involved in the operation of recreation centres, libraries and other council facilities. In Geraldton, where financial modelling suggests they could run out of money in less than a year if drastic action isn't taken immediately, that number reached 120, nearly half of the council's total workforce. Councils across the state employ up to 194,000 people, and in small towns they are often among the largest employers. While some of the workers stood down in Geraldton have been redeployed to control traffic and fix footpaths, chief executive Ross McKim said others had chosen to job-share or take voluntary redundancies. ""The ideal solution for us would be assistance from the federal or state governments allowing us to return workers much sooner when it is safe to do so,"" he said. ""Regrettably, this is currently not possible without the requested support."" Mr McKim urged the state government to consider offering debt relief to local governments as well as deferring the gross rental value revaluation for a year. ""In the case of the City of Greater Geraldton, this would provide a $4.5 million operational expenditure relief that could be used to keep staff and local contractors employed,"" he said. Hundreds of local government staff members, mostly on casual contracts, have also been stood down in Fremantle, Subiaco and Stirling.

51,/national/western-australia/wa-hospital-staff-stood-down-beds-empty-in-unexpected-covid-19-lull-20200409-p54ip0.html,"WA hospital staff stood down, beds empty in unexpected COVID-19 lull","Hospital staff are being stood down and two-thirds of Western Australia's emergency beds remain empty as the state copes with an unexpected lull due to self-isolation restrictions pushing out the expected peak of COVID-19 cases. National cabinet projections released earlier this week indicated WA could have lost about 30,000 people to the virus throughout the pandemic, with the peak initially expected to hit about the same time as the flu season. WA has opened its COVID-19 testing to anyone in the community with flu-like symptoms. Credit:Getty In bracing for the strain on WA hospitals, the state government announced it would cancel all non-urgent elective surgery to free up beds. But as the impact of social distancing and self-isolating began to ""flatten the curve"", and with a number of WA's COVID-19 cases coming from cruise ship passengers, many hospital beds are sitting empty and health workers have been asked to take leave in as the peak continues to push out. One nurse, who asked not to be identified, told WAtoday preparations for COVID-19 patients at her workplace had begun in February, but they had started standing down professionals due to a lack of work and the oncoming economic crisis. ""Over the least few weeks we’ve been trying to reduce the number of nurses,"" she said. ""I’ve had calls on the day of my shift asking me to take the day off because I wasn’t needed."" She said many of her coworkers would have preferred to have received more training about what to do when the crisis did eventually hit rather than take annual leave, but she was grateful WA was not seeing numbers as high as the eastern states. ""If we’re going to have a big spike, it is nice to have a bit of a break,"" she said. ""We have all seen the videos coming out of Europe and Italy, and to a lesser extent America, and of course China in the very beginning, we definitely don’t have anything like that at all. ""We have patients with flu-like symptoms who are separated from the ‘normal’ ED presentations. ""The hospital has done a lot of work to provide the best facilities to cope with the increasing numbers of patients that we see but we’re not seeing the massive numbers like they are overseas."" Around the metropolitan area earlier this week, Rockingham General Hospital recorded the lowest rate of available beds during the day at 83 per cent. At the same time, all beds in Armadale, Fiona Stanley, Sir Charles Gairdner and Osborne Park Hospital were available. Overnight, one third of beds were still available at Bentley Hospital and Fremantle Hospital remained nearly empty. On average about two thirds of beds at metropolitan hospitals remain empty overnight. The WA government has allocated $15 million towards doubling the number of intensive care beds in preparation for the peak. Earlier this week, Health Minister Roger Cook warned while WA was in an encouraging position with low case numbers coming through each day, there would still come a time the virus would “take hold” of the community. “Ultimately I expect we too will be confronted with difficult numbers and community based spread, but what you’re seeing is that we can do this, we’re all in this together, and together we can get through it,” he said. “We are not out of the woods, we are sailing into this storm not out of it ... but when the storm hits, we’ll be ready for it.” Hannah Barry is a journalist for WAtoday.
