Thinking truly outside the box – say, asking whether rugby league has a greater duty to the community than getting its income streams flowing again, or asking whether it is humanly decent to place sport on such a pedestal to its own self-regard – is too far outside.

Up steps John Barilaro, the leader of the NSW National Party, informing us that rugby league is ‘the tonic we need’ to get us through the virus. And you thought the tonic was drinking hot water and swallowing malaria pills. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. So here comes rugby league, afloat in its bubble, engorged with its self-importance, looking after its own, breaking ranks with Australia and the world. When families can’t see each other for Easter, rugby league is celebrating the Easter miracle of once again making itself the news. It’s genius PR, if the aim is to keep people talking about you. And if you think PR is a signifier of IQ, it just shows how smart league is. But what also appeals, from a lifetime of enjoying league, is its decency. After encountering league people over the years, you almost invariably come away with the feeling that you have met someone fundamentally decent. In fact, this decency sets league apart from so many other sports. League people are the salt of the earth. You know that that has to be a fantasy as well, but it’s your personal experience. Compared to other sports, league is replete with genuine, straight-talking, likeable humans. Not people who’ve got their heads so far up their fundaments that they don’t see, much less respect, what is going on in the world outside their bubble. So, while you, the league fan, are fighting with your son to convince him why he can’t go and visit his girlfriend, league is back on. While you can’t celebrate your elderly widowed mother’s birthday with her, league is on. While you go outside in this horrible Australia where police question you for being outdoors and people stink-eye other people for stopping and talking to each other, league is on. While another million people catch a disease and tens of thousands die, league is back on. But you know what? When the NRL starts again, on May 28 or whenever, you will have wrestled with your conscience over whether it is the right thing to sit down and watch this renegade sport, this pariah code, this arena of self-absorption. By then it will have all worn you down. You will give in, because you just want to feel good again, and league will make you feel good. Like a dumb animal, you’ll go towards the thing you can’t help loving, and you’ll celebrate it, because by then, who knows, you might desperately need something to celebrate. League will give you what you need, by giving itself what it needs. You will watch it.

The NRL has earmarked May 28 as the day the premiership will recommence, although they need the players’ union to first agree to the revenues, operating costs and welfare provisions in order for that to happen. Replay   The Rugby League Players Association and head office had agreed to a new pay deal based on the worst-case scenario of no matches being played in 2020, with the parties still yet to agree to the terms of a resumption. That includes receiving a minimum of 29.5 per cent of any additional revenue that could flow into the game as a result in play resuming. The players are keen to return to the field but first want some assurances before doing so. That includes an understanding of the NRL’s operational costs to restart, an important consideration given the stinging criticism head office has received over how much money is being spent to run the game. The Herald last month revealed Rugby League Central spends almost $500,000 a day to run the competition, while broadcast partner Channel Nine - the publishers of this masthead - claims countless millions were “squandered by a bloated head office” in an extraordinary broadside on Thursday. RLPA CEO Clint Newton said the game can’t restart until his members are given assurances about the manner in which it will do so. RLPA board member Daly Cherry-Evans and his fellow NRL players are yet to sign off on a May 28 return.Credit:Getty “I’d like to think it won’t be like a CBA negotiation given the time criticalities associated with this,” Newton said. “We need to be very clear on what’s been brought in and that we’re agreeing on the operational costs. We then need to reach agreement over the distribution to the stakeholder groups over those revenues. “There are a number of key areas and we need to work through the detail. A lot will hinge on what we’re able to generate when building those contract arrangements. “To be clear, we understand why the NRL have proposed a start date. But there are things critical in all of this and that’s why the player consultation process and engagement is paramount. “We still need that information before the players are in a position to endorse or support it. That’s around the welfare and well-being support, the injury management and the revenue, which comes in two parts - the operational costs and the distribution of the revenues.” The RLPA have negotiated the right to conduct a special purpose audit of the NRL’s books and are likely to commence that process next week. The players are keen to understand why the game’s running costs are currently $181 million per annum and what steps the NRL will take to reduce them. The union also wants assurances the health of the players won’t be compromised during the coronavirus, while wanting the Warriors to be given every support while they are away from home. That could include having their families travel with them to Australia. “Player well-being and welfare support (are key considerations),” Newton said. “Medical and injury management, the treatment of injuries and access to facilities and revenue. “We want to know what revenue we are able to generate via a revised competition and one that may be without crowds for an entire year. “Then the operational costs of ensuring best practice is applied and then the percentage distribution of that revenue.” Adrian Proszenko is the Chief Rugby League Reporter for the Sydney Morning Herald.

The move will chop Castle's annual salary – among the lowest of Australia's major professional sports – down to $285,250 from $815,000 for the forseeable future, ""until the game is back in good shape physically"". RA chief Raelene Castle will take a bigger pay cut in a bid to end the stand-off with players.Credit:Getty She had already taken a 50 per cent cut, announced more than a week ago, as a sign of where she thought the game needed to go, she said at the time. But after a further week of work, which included robust back and forth with the Rugby Union Players Association over an emergency pay deal, Castle told the Sydney Morning Herald shaving another 15 per cent off her salary was ""the right thing to do"". ""We've been head down concentrating on trying to find a plan that protects the long term viability of the game, looking under every rock to try to save every penny we can to make sure the game is on a stable footing for the long term,"" she said. ""Off the back of that I've decided to take an additional 15 per cent that will take my pay cut to 65 per cent. Like everyone through the game that's had to stand down and make difficult decisions, I'm no different. ""Overnight 80 per cent of the game's revenue was turned off and, at the time, taking a 50 per cent pay cut was the best thing I felt I could do to lead in this unprecedented situation. After another few weeks of work, the right number is 65 per cent. ""It's the right thing to do. I have made that decision and recommended it to the board because we're facing really tough times and have to make these calls. Like everyone through the game that's had to stand down and make difficult decisions, I'm no different."" Castle is matching the percentage cut RA wants the game's 192 professional players to take until the end of September. The parties were supposed to meet on Thursday to thrash out a deal before the Easter weekend but, with one director struck down with illness, the meeting was delayed until Saturday. RA is hopeful that a domestic competition will be up and running in the third quarter of the year, but Castle did not put an end date on her own salary sacrifice. ""I know the players are hurting as much as we are; they want to be out playing footy again and they're facing extreme uncertainty,"" Castle said. ""They also recognise that they need to come to the party and I'm hopeful that on Saturday we can find a resolution that allows us to confront the challenging period the game is in. ""This is difficult times for everybody. We've stood down 75 per cent of the RA workforce and that was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do in my career. They're people who love the sport and are dedicated to it. ""But we had to make hard decisions early, and a lot of them, to make sure we had certainty over the next six months that we had a plan in place that would see us through to the end of the year."" Castle also confirmed that the actions taken to date would protect about $1 million in community grants RA was scheduled to give all the state and territory unions for grassroots rugby. ""All the feedback we've had from government is that ensuring community rugby can get back to where it was as quickly as possible is important,"" she said. ""That's why maintaining those grants, to make sure we could light up as soon as we need to, is really important. These grants actually keep, for our smaller states and territories, their workers active in the community."" Georgina Robinson is the chief rugby reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald.

RA chief Raelene Castle will take a bigger pay cut in a bid to end the stand-off with players.Credit:Getty She had already taken a 50 per cent cut, announced more than a week ago, as a sign of where she thought the game needed to go, she said at the time. But after a further week of work, which included robust back and forth with the Rugby Union Players Association over an emergency pay deal, Castle told the Sydney Morning Herald shaving another 15 per cent off her salary was ""the right thing to do"". ""We've been head down concentrating on trying to find a plan that protects the long term viability of the game, looking under every rock to try to save every penny we can to make sure the game is on a stable footing for the long term,"" she said. ""Off the back of that I've decided to take an additional 15 per cent that will take my pay cut to 65 per cent. Like everyone through the game that's had to stand down and make difficult decisions, I'm no different. ""Overnight 80 per cent of the game's revenue was turned off and, at the time, taking a 50 per cent pay cut was the best thing I felt I could do to lead in this unprecedented situation. After another few weeks of work, the right number is 65 per cent. ""It's the right thing to do. I have made that decision and recommended it to the board because we're facing really tough times and have to make these calls. Like everyone through the game that's had to stand down and make difficult decisions, I'm no different."" Castle is matching the percentage cut RA wants the game's 192 professional players to take until the end of September. The parties were supposed to meet on Thursday to thrash out a deal before the Easter weekend but, with one director struck down with illness, the meeting was delayed until Saturday. RA is hopeful that a domestic competition will be up and running in the third quarter of the year, but Castle did not put an end date on her own salary sacrifice. ""I know the players are hurting as much as we are; they want to be out playing footy again and they're facing extreme uncertainty,"" Castle said. ""They also recognise that they need to come to the party and I'm hopeful that on Saturday we can find a resolution that allows us to confront the challenging period the game is in. ""This is difficult times for everybody. We've stood down 75 per cent of the RA workforce and that was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do in my career. They're people who love the sport and are dedicated to it. ""But we had to make hard decisions early, and a lot of them, to make sure we had certainty over the next six months that we had a plan in place that would see us through to the end of the year."" Castle also confirmed that the actions taken to date would protect about $1 million in community grants RA was scheduled to give all the state and territory unions for grassroots rugby. ""All the feedback we've had from government is that ensuring community rugby can get back to where it was as quickly as possible is important,"" she said. ""That's why maintaining those grants, to make sure we could light up as soon as we need to, is really important. These grants actually keep, for our smaller states and territories, their workers active in the community."" Georgina Robinson is the chief rugby reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald.

Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk though a long-term plan."" In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfilled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic.

You’re on the committee!” Replay   No. He didn’t know. Turns out most of the innovation committee, which was formed less than two weeks ago to carefully and thoroughly explore when the premiership can recommence, didn’t know anything about it, either. Yet here ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys was about an hour later, talking exclusively to Nine News, confirming that a May 21 or May 28 restart was imminent. The fact barely anyone on the very committee formed to investigate strategies to restart the competition knew about its own recommendations suggests they are merely puppets. It also suggests they were appointed with a return date and an outcome already determined. Problem was, nobody got around to telling long-time broadcast partner Channel Nine, which pays the NRL $125 million a year to show its matches, about any of this. Nine already had its nose firmly out of joint, angered that it hadn't been given a seat at the Project Apollo table. Sources at Nine — publisher of the Herald — say the media company has become increasingly angered about the way negotiations have played out since the NRL decided to suspend the competition on March 23 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has become increasingly hands-on with those discussions — and he hasn’t liked what he’s seen in the past two weeks. When confidential details from one meeting with NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg and chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo were leaked to the press, it only added to the animosity. Channel Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has taken control of broadcast negotiations with the NRL.Credit:Peter Braig When the Herald broke the story on Wednesday night about the planned May 21 kick-off, it blindsided Nine. It was the final straw. So, at 11am on Thursday, Nine got out the whacking stick — and it whacked hard. A statement released to Nine News and the Herald said the coronavirus pandemic “has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years” and revealed it had “bailed” out the game with a $50m loan in the past, but that “much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. Around the same time, the innovation committee was meeting at League Central, discussing the game’s fabulous early return to the field … Then everyone’s phones start lighting up with messages and phone calls. Nine’s stunning broadside can be interpreted several ways. The immediate thought was that the company wants out of its broadcast deal, a line that’s been pushed by News Corp for weeks and, in some respects, understandably so after Nine announced to the Australian Stock Exchange it would save $130m if the NRL didn’t play another match this year. Indeed, News Corp has done a solid job pushing a particular narrative throughout this crisis, highlighting that Nine didn’t make its quarterly broadcast payment on April 1 … while often neglecting to mention that Fox Sports also didn’t make its payment. The play is understandable: Fox Sports and Kayo rely on subscriptions — and therefore content in the form of matches — to survive. Nine considers the game a “loss leader” — something that is great for its brand and news division despite the heavy costs involved with broadcasting matches. Many inside Nine’s Willoughby bunker are adamant the long-time broadcaster of rugby league doesn’t want to walk away from the game. Relax, they say, we haven’t heard commentator Ray Warren screaming “Papenhuyzen!” or “Sivo!” or any other player's name for the last time. Sunday matches leading into the 6pm news bulletin, the State of Origin monolith and the finals series mean too much to Nine. Nine, publishers of this masthead, stood to save more than $130 million if there was no more NRL played this season.Credit:Getty Rather, the attack on the NRL was seen as purely strategic as Marks plays hardball in renegotiating the broadcast deal. He argues the game is an inferior product if it isn't played before crowds and the season extends into October, November and December. In doing so, though, the statement is an extraordinary smackdown of the NRL’s culture, and in particular Greenberg, who was claiming only days ago talks with Nine had been quite “positive” and “productive”. Meanwhile, V’landys has been rather effusive in his praise of Marks in recent days, telling the Herald earlier this week: “Hugh is a good man. He’s a very good CEO. He’s looking after Channel Nine’s interests …” Marks was approached for comment for this piece but declined. Playing hardball is one thing, but some have seen the play as opportunistic. Nine might broadcast the game, it might pay the NRL handsomely, but it doesn’t own the game. And who is Nine to tell the NRL how to waste its money anyway? Is Project Apollo going to look more like Apollo 11 (which reached the Moon) or Apollo 13 (which didn’t and became a Tom Hanks movie)? After a meeting-a-thon on Thursday, club bosses were left feeling that June 4 was a more realistic start date than May 28, which the NRL announced it is now aiming for. “It was a waste of time,” huffed one chief executive. “We’d read it all in the paper already.” What’s clear is that the idea of players locking down in a “bubble” has been burst. The only thing that really matters now is working out how the NRL can get around border issues with Queensland and New Zealand. You can bet a whole lot of Kiwis on either side of the Tasman will be watching with interest to see if the Warriors get preferential treatment in coming into the country. Raelene Castle was close to announcing a rich new broadcast deal with Optus before coronavirus changed everything.Credit:Getty And you thought they only played the Blame Game in rugby league! Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle is under heavy fire as the embattled code struggles through uncertain times — and, in many respects, she deserves it. It explains the deep level of frustration and pain felt by the many people who still love and care for the game. That said, Castle’s crucifixion for not agreeing to a deal with long-time broadcaster Fox Sports pre-coronavirus is unfair. Sources familiar with negotiations report she was only a week away from stitching up a lucrative deal with Optus, one that was far better than the offer on the table from Fox Sports, which had been bullying her for weeks into agreeing to terms. That’s right: a week. Then the coronavirus went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like infecting nearly 1.5m people across the world. The Rugby Union Players Association might also be at war with Castle but a couple of staffers on the lowest of wages at RA tell this column she exhausted every option in trying to save their jobs. Interim chairman Paul McLean has declared that Castle has “the full support of the board” — never a great sign — but it is unlikely she will be frogmarched anytime soon.

He’s looking after Channel Nine’s interests …” Marks was approached for comment for this piece but declined. Playing hardball is one thing, but some have seen the play as opportunistic. Nine might broadcast the game, it might pay the NRL handsomely, but it doesn’t own the game. And who is Nine to tell the NRL how to waste its money anyway? Is Project Apollo going to look more like Apollo 11 (which reached the Moon) or Apollo 13 (which didn’t and became a Tom Hanks movie)? After a meeting-a-thon on Thursday, club bosses were left feeling that June 4 was a more realistic start date than May 28, which the NRL announced it is now aiming for. “It was a waste of time,” huffed one chief executive. “We’d read it all in the paper already.” What’s clear is that the idea of players locking down in a “bubble” has been burst. The only thing that really matters now is working out how the NRL can get around border issues with Queensland and New Zealand. You can bet a whole lot of Kiwis on either side of the Tasman will be watching with interest to see if the Warriors get preferential treatment in coming into the country. Raelene Castle was close to announcing a rich new broadcast deal with Optus before coronavirus changed everything.Credit:Getty And you thought they only played the Blame Game in rugby league! Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle is under heavy fire as the embattled code struggles through uncertain times — and, in many respects, she deserves it. It explains the deep level of frustration and pain felt by the many people who still love and care for the game. That said, Castle’s crucifixion for not agreeing to a deal with long-time broadcaster Fox Sports pre-coronavirus is unfair. Sources familiar with negotiations report she was only a week away from stitching up a lucrative deal with Optus, one that was far better than the offer on the table from Fox Sports, which had been bullying her for weeks into agreeing to terms. That’s right: a week. Then the coronavirus went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like infecting nearly 1.5m people across the world. The Rugby Union Players Association might also be at war with Castle but a couple of staffers on the lowest of wages at RA tell this column she exhausted every option in trying to save their jobs. Interim chairman Paul McLean has declared that Castle has “the full support of the board” — never a great sign — but it is unlikely she will be frogmarched anytime soon. THE QUOTE “The NRL is the tonic we need to get through this virus!” — Deputy Premier John Barilaro. Awesome. It will go well with all the gin I’m drinking as I live my best Iso Life.

The governing body has announced the competition will return in seven weeks, but will first need to come to an agreement with its broadcast partners over the value of the rights deal before signing off on the structure of the season. Replay   As revealed by the Herald on Wednesday afternoon, the NRL had two proposals on the table and was set to decide on either a 15-round competition that would see all teams play each other once or a 16-round, two-conference system. However, the Herald has been told by sources with knowledge of the discussions that tense broadcast negotiations have forced the governing body to rethink those plans, with the NRL now considering fulfilling its contractual obligations by playing the remaining 22 rounds of football. That could see the competition head into November. ""Today what we landed on was a starting date,"" ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce said. ""We haven't finalised what that [competition] looks like yet. Why we want to firm up a date is to give certainty to players and their schedules, clubs and thousands or people who are out of work through clubs and millions of fans.

It's understood the latest possible date that the NRL is willing to play the grand final without disruption to the 2021 season is November 15.

That would allow all teams, with the likely exception of the Warriors, to base themselves at home and travel interstate on chartered flights on game day.

It was also determined that all teams would have to return to pre-season training at the same time to not disadvantage clubs such as the Warriors, who at this point will have to undergo a 14-day self-isolation program when they arrive in Australia. May 4 has been earmarked as the first day of training. However, as it stands, the Warriors are in lockdown in New Zealand until the end of this month, and would require government exemption to travel across the Tasman.

The sickness attacking sport was cost-accelerating, unsustainable debt, mainly for media rights of the football codes and cricket. All this came at a time the revenue streams of the free-to-air and pay-TV broadcasters were under siege from streaming services such as Netflix. Replay   So, when the NRL’s long-time FTA broadcast partner, Channel Nine, delivered a scathing attack on the code on Thursday, it was paradoxically both unprecedented and unsurprising. It’s all about cost. Nine doesn’t want to pay full freight for a disrupted season with falling viewership. Nor will the network even agree to pay a pro-rata amount for games telecast, given it will be played in empty stadiums, devoid of the theatre of the crowd, possibly all through 2020. Furthermore, Nine boss Hugh Marks probably wants to renegotiate the final two years of the 2018-22 contract. In fact, he almost certainly seeks to extend the existing contract at significantly reduced rates. The days when networks bought sports rights to prevent the opposition acquiring them – as Manly bought North Sydney first-graders and relegated them to reserve grade – are over. But for Nine to launch this brutal salvo on rugby league because it has been shut out of the confidential talks over a restructured 2020 competition is a diversion. Fox Sports, which televises exclusively five games a week to Nine’s simulcasted three, has been sidelined, too.

NRL clubs are finding that ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce and ex-member for Dubbo Troy Grant, a former NSW Nationals leader, have formed a triumvirate, with V’landys dominating and everyone else subservient. Clubs are equally in the dark, unsure whether the competition, due to restart on May 28, will be located in Sydney or Queensland, or whether it will be two conferences or one. Now, with the Herald suggesting all remaining rounds will be played, it would seem V’landys, while not talking to the telecasters, is at least listening, or more accurately, reading Marks’s play. While Fox Sports hasn’t attacked the NRL with the unprecedented venom of Nine, it’s not as if the Murdoch empire hasn’t played a hard line with the other football codes in these belt-tightening times. It is a network that has previously demonstrated a duty of care to Australian sports – it paid a restructured FFA above market rates to unshackle it from a nationalistic, sectional club structure and it elevated rugby union from shamateurism, launching Super Rugby 25 years ago with a $US550m 10-year contract. But Fox Sports is bleeding red ink. It is dependent on $1.07 billion in shareholders' loans, has made 200 staff redundant and stood down another 140 on Tuesday. Those numbers could yet double as it seeks to further protect its bottom line. Now Fox Sports is refusing to make another rights offer to Rugby Australia and will seek to free itself from soccer, with both sports having already sacked most of their staff. So, where does that leave rugby league? It is a sport on the federal government’s anti-siphoning list, meaning it must be offered to a FTA broadcaster before Foxtel can bid. The financial meltdown, aka the Corona Correction, won’t result in NRL being screened on the ABC, because no commercial network can exist without NRL or AFL. Channel Ten had NRL in the 1990s, lost AFL rights 10 years ago and, as Global Sport and Media’s Colin Smith says, it has caused ""a downward spiral ever since and led to their insolvency”.

20,/sport/afl/afl-given-cover-for-earlier-restart-by-desperate-nrl-20200408-p54ien.html,AFL given cover for earlier restart by desperate NRL,"The NRL hopes to be playing games by the end of May. This prospective starting date is actually several weeks, if not months, ahead of what AFL club people believed probable for their resumption. In AFL clubland, there was a widespread view up until last weekend that footy wouldn't resume in crowdless stadia – no matter where those games were played – until perhaps late July or August. The AFL played just one round behind closed doors before the season was halted.Credit:AAP The Victorian government advice, based on the medicos and experts who study the pandemic and project what will unfold, had been that the coronavirus peak would be around late May or early June. But the NRL seems to have developed some form of immunity from the virus, to the point that they're preparing to open the games, though obviously not the turnstiles, on either May 21 or May 28, with the caveat that the competition will be relocated to Sydney, where most of the clubs are based. The AFL does not think that the NRL's decisions are relevant to what the financially stronger code does next, or that rugby league's eagerness to jump from the gates – an analogy that befits ARLC chairman Peter V'landys, who also runs Racing NSW – will see them follow the leader. But, in terms of public perceptions about what is acceptable and unacceptable for a sporting code amid a global pandemic, rugby league, in their unseemly desperation to play, are providing cover for the AFL. The AFL has been consistently saying that it will act on the advice of the federal and state governments. They are only mildly desperate to resume, as distinct from the absolute desperation of rugby league, which does not have a stadium to provide security for a line of credit and can survive only by getting the game on screens. Replay   As one rugby league official told The Sydney Morning Herald's Michael Chammas, for the AFL not playing games is like losing a limb, whereas it represents ""decapitation for the NRL"". That rugby league games could resume as early as late May seems extraordinary. It reveals not simply the extent of desperation to get the the broadcasting tap turned back on, but that there is clearly a special relationship with the NSW government, whose Deputy Premier John Barilaro told Channel Nine: ""The NRL is the tonic we need to get through through this"". V'landys, as the CEO of Racing NSW, has managed to keep that sport on track, to so speak. He must carry a decent whip; certainly, he is a persuasive man when dealing with the NSW government, which is reportedly willing to grant rugby league an exemption under the state's Public Health Order Act to get back on. The AFL has serious clout, too, but might not be able to plonk all their players in one city or town, given the logistics of a competition with teams in five states, including Western Australia and South Australia. Perhaps they can look at Sydney as a venue, given that the NRL has been given approval far earlier than the public expected. One senior AFL club official, observing the NRL's position compared to the AFL, observed: ""The NRL is ploughing the path for the AFL ... they're doing the heavy lifting."" Not for the first time and probably not for the last time, the AFL can look virtuous by comparison, in this case, simply by waiting just a little longer.

21,/sport/rugby-union/this-reset-might-be-just-the-thing-to-make-rugby-great-again-20200408-p54icp.html,This reset might be just the thing to make rugby great again,"So where was rugby before it was so rudely interrupted? I remember. It was a Bledisloe in the mid-1990s before the professional era, and the Wallabies were about to play the All Blacks in New Zealand. In the hour or two before kick-off, the injured John Eales was on duty as one of the ""dirt trackers"", flogging souvenir Wallabies T-shirts in the car park. The money raised would be added to the tour fund to be divided equally between players after the final Test, which would add a few hundred dollars to the $50 a day they were each earning on tour. Glory days ... Former Wallabies captain John Eales raises The William Webb Ellis Trophy after the 1999 World Cup.Credit:Tim Clayton At that time, all the Wallabies had their own jobs - some with serious careers in business, law, engineering, dentistry - and the primary motivation for playing was personal pride, for national honour. Beyond their playing commitments, each Wallaby understood that beyond playing they were expected to give back to the rugby community, to speak at end-of-season dinners for free, do kids training sessions, turn up at whatever rugby functions were happening and generally beat the rugby drum. The idea that they were not just players but ambassadors for the game was not only taken seriously, but cherished by the players. And then it all changed with stunning rapidity. Just over a year after flogging T-shirts for $20  – and Kiwi bucks at that – Eales signed a contract for a reputed $500,000 a year, when rugby went professional, and the game changed forever. Or did it? But we’ll get to that ... Replay   The first burst of professional rugby in Australia, basically until just a bit after the Eales era was over, went better than anyone could have imagined: the Wallabies started winning Bledisloes; lifted the 1999 World Cup; beat the British and Irish Lions; and crowds swelled as never before. The Waratahs regularly played before crowds of 40,000 at the Sydney Football Stadium and everyone in the wider rugby community felt a deep connection to their representative teams. In the past few years, however? I know it, and you know it. The game in this country has lost its way, on and off the field. Both the provincial teams and the Wallabies more or less stopped winning, the crowds stopped coming and, most worryingly of all, there was a loss of connection between the rugby community and our highly paid stars. After the Wallabies miraculously made the final of the World Cup in 2015, I had to threaten management with holy hell to get five Wallabies to turn up at a Cauliflower Club lunch, where 800 of the rugby community were gathering to welcome them home. I was told at the time the cause of their reluctance was because they were ""tired, after a long World Cup"". Ambassadors for the game? Not really. Raelene Castle had to threaten her own holy hell to get some of the 2019 Wallabies to turn up for a function at the Australian embassy in Tokyo during that year’s World Cup. The same malaise was apparent at provincial level. Earlier this year, the fine rugby folk of Albury did a promotion on the morning of a trial match between the Rebels and the Brumbies, saying come and meet the stars, only to be advised by Brumbies management a short time before their scheduled appearance that they wouldn’t be coming because there was a bit of drizzle. Tevita Kuridrani of the Brumbies is tackled by NSW playmaker Will Harrison during round seven of Super Rugby, just before the season was suspended.Credit:Getty Who was there? Nick Farr-Jones and Tim Gavin, two Wallabies of the old days, still turning up to  beat the rugby drum all those years on, for no reward. My point? Rod Kafer is right in saying Australian rugby has been sick for many years, and we all know that. I disagree strongly, however, in attributing the slide to any person in particular or even a few people. Mostly the people you see at the top level are seriously good rugby folk – and I am thinking particularly at board and chair level – doing their absolute best for the game, with their only reward being endless headaches and bitter public criticism as everyone rips in. What ails the game in this country is not due to particular people making wrong decisions. The way back to rude rugby health will not be an easy one. The coronavirus pause, however, is going to allow a massive reset of the game in this country. It's a time to recognise what has gone wrong and how we can come together as rugby people of good will to fix it, make it better. I say the starting point is we need to get back to the old values as much as possible, make players understand they owe the game far more than the game will ever owe them. Got that, you blokes? While it is one thing for you to make a good living from it, if you don’t have a sense of privilege in wearing the jersey, you needn’t bother putting the boots on in the first place, and good luck in rugby league, or France, or wherever. In the new age to come, we must build slowly. Cutting back players' salaries to rather more humble levels will be easy – the new cake to split up is going to be a lot smaller anyway. But let us also look at what professional rugby can learn from the amateurs. Before the plague, it was the amateur game that flourished as people flocked back to the club matches, with beer and sausages on the hill on a Saturday afternoon to watch the local team go round. Why, because they felt a connection to them. The new professional game must prize that connection most of all. A rough ride is ahead. But on the other side, at least we know our starting point will be populated only by the true believers. And this will be the sweetest victory of all. @Peter_Fitz Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", ,"April 9, 2020"
22,/sport/nrl/sure-get-the-nrl-party-started-again-but-don-t-trash-the-brand-20200406-p54hju.html,"Sure, get the NRL party started again - but don't trash the brand","When you phone Peter V’landys to talk about rugby league and its immediate future, he asks you to hold a second while he sends through an email. The ARL Commission chairman flicks through his latest update on the dramatic fall in the daily increase of people testing positive to COVID-19 in NSW in recent weeks. Replay   On March 19, when the Bulldogs played North Queensland before no crowds in Thursday night football, the daily increase was 32 per cent. When V’landys announced the competition was shutting down on March 23, it was 22 per cent. “And today it is 2.21 per cent,” he said on Monday afternoon. “That’s why I think we can get back on soon.” V’landys’ haste in getting the NRL competition going again, in three or four “bubbles” in NSW and/or Queensland, is dividing opinion. He doesn't care. He's a divider, a disrupter, an agitator. The Rabbitohs celebrate a try against the Sharks in round one. When will they get to do it again?Credit:Getty His urgency reflects the need to get the money tap from the game’s broadcast partners flowing again. Both Fox Sports and Channel Nine (the publisher of this masthead) didn’t make their quarterly repayments on April 1, as you would expect. No football, no pay. The NRL wants to get the party going again as soon as possible, maybe as soon as the end of next month. But it needs to be wary about trashing the product. There are certainly some funky ideas getting about. As revealed by the Herald last week — and endorsed by NSW coach Brad Fittler — one idea before the innovation committee charged with rebooting the season is starting with State of Origin. Fittler went a step further and raised the prospect of Tongan players being available for selection after their mid-season Test against New Zealand was abandoned. There’s another idea of finishing the season with the Origin series, by which time crowds might be allowed to return to stadiums, thereby filling the coffers for a game that’s already taken a huge financial hit. Then there’s the novel idea of playing it in the middle of the season like it normally does. Crazy times. The notion of a best-of-three grand final series is also getting a run. So, too, 20-minute quarters — something V’landys was actually looking at pre-coronavirus as a way of maximising advertising revenue for broadcasters in the next TV deal. One funky proposal is to restart the season with a State of Origin season. Credit:AAP How about big, fat “no” to all of the above. This season will have an asterisk next to it no matter what happens — especially if the Warriors are excluded from the premiership. But let's not make it any bigger than it should be. Surely the aim is to keep the competition as pure as possible. “We want the competition to remain as authentic and genuine as we can,” V’landys said. “We don’t want people questioning if the grand final winner deserved it or not. That’s why we want to start the season as soon as possible.” A June start means every side could play each other once, a finals series, and an Origin series. Any later than that and the season starts pushing into the spring and potentially summer. That has ramifications for Nine because it's broadcasting all of Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup matches, as well as the finals series. Nine has told the NRL that it would need to renegotiate its deal if the NRL season went beyond Sunday, October 4 - the date set down for the grand final at the SCG - because it will have two major sporting events competing with each other. The T20 final is set down for November 15 — but there’s every chance it won’t be an issue because it remains murky at best whether Australia’s international borders will be open by October. Meanwhile, NRL clubs are torn about how the season should look — and when it should restart. How will players respond to being locked down, in isolation, for months at a time? The younger players might feel restless, and there are serious doubts about the ability of some to remain truly quarantined from the rest of society. What of the older players with young families? Souths hooker Damien Cook has said he will struggle being away from his for a fortnight. Sharks captain Wade Graham knows it will be tough but wants to get paid. The innovation committee, headed by Wayne Pearce, meets on Thursday but before then and beyond there’s a whole round of meetings — mostly via conference calls — taking place. Good luck to all concerned trying to navigate rugby league’s greatest obstacle course since News Limited and the ARL pieced the game back together in 1998 in the wake of the Super League war. No matter what happens, though, it should have one basic premise: make the NRL season as normal as possible, in the most abnormal year of our lives.

RA made the offer in response to the players' request for any wages sacrificed to be deferred and held in a trust, controlled by the players, with a portion set aside and redirected into community rugby. Two-thirds: Rugby Australia is proposing Australia's professional players take a 65 per cent pay cut for the next six months. Credit:Getty The players union also asked for players to be allowed to break their contracts and play elsewhere if they did not want to accept an agreed pay cut. RA rejected both proposals and countered with a 65 per cent cut until the end of September. It is significantly lower than the NRL's 75 per cent reduction for the length of the shutdown and netball's 70 per cent pay cut - to wages significantly lower to start with. AFL players have agreed a 50 per cent cut until the end of May. Three-quarters of all RA's non-player workforce have been stood down, its top band of executives have taken a 30 per cent pay cut and boss Raelene Castle has volunteered a 50 per cent saving on her annual salary of $815,000. The parties are expected to meet on Thursday to thrash out their differences, which appear to be numerous, about four weeks after Super Rugby was shutdown. Replay   With Brumbies players already paid their April salaries in full and the pay cycles of the other three Super sides bearing down, both the players and RA appear willing to work through the Easter weekend to reach an agreement. But their starting points seem poles apart, with RA stunned by the players' request that their wages be locked up in a trust, overseen by a players-appointed trustee. Rugby Union Players Association (RUPA) sources denied the players expected to recoup any wages they sacrificed, but confirmed they wanted to see some of the money funnelled to grassroots clubs, which have also all had their seasons shut down. There is some international precedent for players to take deferrals instead of cuts, with Ireland's professional players agreeing a ""sliding scale"" ranging from 10 per cent to up to 50 per cent. The deferrals took effect at the start of the month and had no fixed end date, but would ""remain subject to constant review of the financial circumstances of the IRFU and provinces"". ""The IRFU hopes to return to full pay, and repay any deferrals, as soon as possible,"" the IRFU said in a statement. Australia's financial woes would render this scenario impossible, with RA projecting a $120 million revenue loss if no rugby is played for the rest of the year. The organisation is still waiting on further details about World Rugby's assistance package, which will likely be offered in the form of a low-interest loan. RA also viewed dimly the players' request for releases should they not like the look of a pay cut. Officials fear a mass exodus of players that the organisation has supported and remunerated handsomely on multi-year deals. RA would also be keenly aware of needing to keep the country's top players on shore to support any competition designed for 2021 and beyond.

RA made the offer in response to the players' request for any wages sacrificed to be deferred and held in a trust, controlled by the players, with a portion set aside and redirected into community rugby. Two-thirds: Rugby Australia is proposing Australia's professional players take a 65 per cent pay cut for the next six months. Credit:Getty The players union also asked for players to be allowed to break their contracts and play elsewhere if they did not want to accept an agreed pay cut. RA rejected both proposals and countered with a 65 per cent cut until the end of September. It is significantly lower than the NRL's 75 per cent reduction for the length of the shutdown and netball's 70 per cent pay cut - to wages significantly lower to start with. AFL players have agreed a 50 per cent cut until the end of May. Three-quarters of all RA's non-player workforce have been stood down, its top band of executives have taken a 30 per cent pay cut and boss Raelene Castle has volunteered a 50 per cent saving on her annual salary of $815,000. The parties are expected to meet on Thursday to thrash out their differences, which appear to be numerous, about four weeks after Super Rugby was shutdown. Replay   With Brumbies players already paid their April salaries in full and the pay cycles of the other three Super sides bearing down, both the players and RA appear willing to work through the Easter weekend to reach an agreement. But their starting points seem poles apart, with RA stunned by the players' request that their wages be locked up in a trust, overseen by a players-appointed trustee. Rugby Union Players Association (RUPA) sources denied the players expected to recoup any wages they sacrificed, but confirmed they wanted to see some of the money funnelled to grassroots clubs, which have also all had their seasons shut down. There is some international precedent for players to take deferrals instead of cuts, with Ireland's professional players agreeing a ""sliding scale"" ranging from 10 per cent to up to 50 per cent. The deferrals took effect at the start of the month and had no fixed end date, but would ""remain subject to constant review of the financial circumstances of the IRFU and provinces"". ""The IRFU hopes to return to full pay, and repay any deferrals, as soon as possible,"" the IRFU said in a statement. Australia's financial woes would render this scenario impossible, with RA projecting a $120 million revenue loss if no rugby is played for the rest of the year. The organisation is still waiting on further details about World Rugby's assistance package, which will likely be offered in the form of a low-interest loan. RA also viewed dimly the players' request for releases should they not like the look of a pay cut. Officials fear a mass exodus of players that the organisation has supported and remunerated handsomely on multi-year deals. RA would also be keenly aware of needing to keep the country's top players on shore to support any competition designed for 2021 and beyond.

Instead, they're at their laptops, kicking their brains into gear. There are a few yawns and dodgy internet connections as assistant coach Chris Whitaker sets up a Zoom video conference call for half-a-dozen players who will spend the next 90 minutes or so forensically analysing a rugby match on the other side of the world. Waratahs playmaker Will Harrison has embraced the online sessions where he and teammates analyse rugby matches. Credit:James Brickwood The Sydney Morning Herald was invited to sit in on the meeting to observe how leading Australian rugby players are using their downtime to try and improve as players. Last week's review was a Six Nations fixture. What's on the menu today? Saracens up against Leinster in last year's Champions Cup final; Owen Farrell versus Johnny Sexton. There are only so many reviews the Waratahs can do of their six outings this year, so coaches have begun experimenting by getting a mix of experienced heads and rookies to discuss the intricacies and patterns of matches in a vastly different manner to what would normally happen during a regular Super Rugby season. The team's head performance analyst, Craig Whelan, is in charge of the match itself. He pauses and rewinds when either a coach or player asks. Halfback Jake Gordon gets the ball rolling, only after teammates have stopped chuckling at his new peroxide blond hair. He quickly explains he lost a game of Uno to roommate and fellow No.9 Mitch Short, who is also on the call. Gordon leans forward and begins discussing the merit of a longer-than-normal Saracens box kick. His eyes dart across the field. Immediately, the rugby jargon blurted from coaches and players is overwhelming for someone without anywhere near the technical knowledge of a professional player, or privy to specific team calls. These were just a few examples: ""Jam in on an AK. We'd do a Tuesday here. Double pump. Pods of three. Reloading. Inside, outside, one out the back. Setting up for a Dog. They were looking to do a Rhino."" (Top to bottom) Waratahs analyst Craig Whelan, assistant coach Chris Whitaker, Jake Gordon, Mitch Short, Alex Newsome and backs coach Matt Cockbain join a Zoom session.  There are, of course, longer and less complicated explanations, but the level of detail and deep thinking would surprise many rusted-on fans who consume the game passively at grounds or on television without a player soundtrack. Gordon and Will Harrison now have a robust debate as the game is paused. Head coach Rob Penney and Whitaker prefer to teach by asking questions rather than delivering lectures, much like high school teachers to their students. Should one or two players be in the backfield in this scenario? ""Think of the amount of tries that come from passes compared to kicks,"" Gordon says. ""How many tries off kicks would you see scored from 30 metres out? Why don't you make the priority your front line and encourage them to take the kick in back play. ""Because it makes the fullback work extra hard,"" Harrison says. ""You want them to go for that low-percentage play in that area of the field,"" Gordon says. It is fascinating watching players pick apart scenarios: analysing mismatches; how they could score with relevant set moves; how many to commit to rucks; whether the blindside or openside is a better option; what feedback should be shouted at what exact moment; as well as countless other factors taken into account. At the end, players offer opinions on the style and tactics of both teams. Even the quieter characters, such as rookies Ben Donaldson and Joey Walton, add value to the conversation. Rather than packaging up clips to review from a regular weekend match, the extended exercise is set to be the norm for players who are now largely confined to their homes. Despite some Waratahs staff being stood down, the Zoom calls will continue for as long as players are fronting up for work. ""Back in the day, you had VCRs, so you sat down and watched the whole game,"" Whitaker says afterwards. ""We're trying to get as many young guys in there as we can so they're learning. ""Back in the day when I was playing, the rugby brains were phenomenal. We had George Gregan, Stephen Larkham, Rod Kafer and John Eales to name a few. It was frightening. You watched and learnt off them and hopefully these guys learn off each other and everyone joins in. ""It's just trying to probe discussions and get guys thinking about it. The more decision-making on the field you have, the better you're going to go."" Harrison, who started at No.10 in all six games before the season was suspended, is young but curious by nature, having made a conscious effort, with Whitaker's encouragement, to watch a couple of rugby matches a day at home during the downtime. ""It's about developing our rugby IQs,"" Harrison says. ""It gives you a different perspective and way to look at things. It's more onto the players to break it down. ""Not everyone agrees with things. You can be brutally honest and bounce ideas off each other. It makes you think with more depth rather than just watching a game, and it definitely helps my footy as a five-eighth.""

Australian cricket would be hit hard financially if next season's Test series against India was scrapped.Credit:AAP However cricket sources have confirmed to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald that CA is honing in on the 50 per cent figure in its projections for the next 12 months, which is supposed to feature the men's Twenty20 World Cup and the lucrative marquee home men's series against India. Unlike the governing bodies of the major football codes, who have already copped colossal financial whacks as a result of their respective seasons being shut down in the early rounds, CA has considerably more time up its sleeve with next season still six months away, and no planned home international engagements until August's scheduled men's one-day series against Zimbabwe. But while the exact impact of the virus on CA remains unclear, measures including cost-cutting are being discussed internally as part of broad plans to deal with the possibilities the body is staring at over the next 12 months, including the chance the Indian Test series – worth around $300 million – doesn't go ahead. CA has already delayed the announcement of its central contract lists, hoping to gain further understanding of the sport's landscape. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017, players are bound to ride the financial waves experienced by the game as part of a revenue-sharing model. Several player agents have privately queried CA's decision to delay the contracting period, noting that barely any major cricket in Australia has yet been affected by the pandemic. According to its financial report last year, CA had net assets of almost $98 million including cash reserves of more than $26 million, although CA's financial model has long been centred around the influx of cash generated by the men's home series against India, meaning that next summer is arguably the one in which CA can least afford international cricket not to be played. Meanwhile the Australian Cricketers' Association on Wednesday announced a $250,000 emergency assistance fund to help its members suffering financial hardship as a result of the virus. The scheme is targeted at past players as well as current part-time female players who rely on an additional wage to supplement their cricket income. Players can receive up to $2000 from the ACA although any sum greater than $1000 will be provided as a loan. ""Over the past couple of weeks, we've spoken to several members who are doing it tough, and we've been trying to help where we can,"" said Kelly Applebee, the ACA's general manager of member programs and relations. ""We've worked hard over that time to bring together a framework around the support we can provide, as well as some significant resources, and we encourage those members who have felt the impact of the coronavirus and who are still waiting on government support, to get in touch with us as we may be able to help."" The start of the Indian Premier League season has already been delayed from March 29 to April 15 although the prospect of that competition beginning next week is doubtful. Several leading Australian players are contracted to IPL clubs, with their massive pay days at risk if the competition doesn't go ahead at some stage this year. Fringe Australian paceman Michael Neser was due to play for Surrey in England's County Championship however his contract has been cancelled as a result of the pandemic, which has placed England's home summer in grave doubt. On Wednesday, Neser received his third Ian Healy Trophy after being named as Queensland Bulls player of the year. Daniel is an Age sports reporter Copyright © 2020", Daniel Cherny ,"April 8, 2020"

The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2020, published on Thursday, crowns Stokes as the sport's pre-eminent player – the first Englishman to receive the prestigious honour since Andrew Flintoff in 2005. The award is the latest to be bestowed upon the 28-year-old all-rounder following his heroic exploits last summer, when he inspired his team to an unforgettable triumph in the World Cup before producing one of the greatest innings of all time to win the Ashes Test at Headingley.

First, with a mixture of outrageous talent and good fortune, he rescued England's run-chase in the World Cup final, before helping to hit 15 off the super over,"" said Wisden editor Lawrence Booth. ""Then, in the third Ashes Test at Headingley, he produced one of the great innings, smashing an unbeaten 135 to pinch a one-wicket win. Against red ball or white, he was a force of nature."" Wisden has also revealed its five cricketers of the year, led by Stokes' World Cup-winning teammate Jofra Archer. Archer became a first-choice player in an England one-day side for the World Cup and by the time the Lord's finale came down to its last six deliveries, it was the Barbados-born paceman who stood up to be counted by sending down the super over. He was just as important to the Ashes, bowling at lightning speed on Test debut in a duel with Steve Smith that will live long in the memory. Of the remaining order, three are Australian with nods for Pat Cummins, Marnus Labuschagne and Ellyse Perry – who also reclaimed the leading women's cricketer in the world title from Smriti Mandhana. Cummins, currently ranked as the world's No.1 Test bowler by the ICC, was a dominant force as Australia retained the Ashes urn in a 2-2 series draw, taking 29 wickets at 19.62. Labuschagne would have been considered a long shot for such recognition at the start of the summer but went from strength to strength after becoming international cricket's first concussion substitute after the brutal conclusion to Archer versus Smith. He went on to average more than 50 and has gone from back-up player to No.3 batsman in the Test standings. PA Copyright © 2020", ,"April 8, 2020"

Sources with knowledge of the deal suggest Fox Sports will have to pay the final quarterly sum for this season, due on April 15, but could issue FFA with a breach notice if the A-League remains postponed by the end of this financial year. Barrister Bret Walker, SC (left) is advising FFA through its looming broadcast clash with Fox Sports. Credit:AAP Under the terms of the contract, the FFA is free to postpone the A-League season without punishment so long as they complete the entire season within a contract year, which runs from July 1 until June 30. FFA is due to decide on April 22 as to whether the season can resume but there appears to be very little prospect of play being resumed in the short term. Senior A-League sources are touting a possible return date in July, but even that isn't certain. Amid fears that delay could allow Fox Sports to tear up its contract with the A-League – which has three years left to run and is worth $57m a year – sources close to FFA confirmed leading silk Bret Walker SC has been engaged ahead of a potential legal fight with the broadcaster. FFA chief James Johnson is looking at alternatives in case Fox Sports withdraws from the A-League.Credit:AAP Sydney-based Walker is one Australia's foremost legal minds and has taken on a wide range of high-profile cases throughout his career, having represented rugby league players, tobacco companies, politicians and alleged organised crime figures. He also headed the royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, the review into national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and Swimming Australia's probe of drug use within the country's swimming team at the London Olympics in 2012. A High Court appeals specialist, Walker successfully argued Cardinal Pell's convictions for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996 should be quashed. The involvement of a barrister of Walker's calibre in football's affairs is a sign of how seriously FFA and the A-League is treating the prospect of a court battle with Foxtel, the owners of Fox Sports, to enforce the remainder of the TV contract and other similar arrangements with sponsors which could also come into question. There are three seasons left to run on the current broadcast deal but Fox Sports has not given any assurances to FFA, clubs or players about the future. The uncertainty has prompted FFA and club owners to begin canvassing potential broadcasters for next season. Fox Sports is facing a major financial crisis of its own, with more than 200 workers at parent company Foxtel made redundant this week and a further 140 stood down without pay in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fox is not expected to step away from its obligations with the AFL or NRL, but has been unhappy with the ratings performance of the A-League for some time, and many recent staff cuts have included football-specific presenters, producers and journalists.

FFA chief James Johnson is looking at alternatives in case Fox Sports withdraws from the A-League.Credit:AAP Sydney-based Walker is one Australia's foremost legal minds and has taken on a wide range of high-profile cases throughout his career, having represented rugby league players, tobacco companies, politicians and alleged organised crime figures. He also headed the royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, the review into national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and Swimming Australia's probe of drug use within the country's swimming team at the London Olympics in 2012. A High Court appeals specialist, Walker successfully argued Cardinal Pell's convictions for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996 should be quashed. The involvement of a barrister of Walker's calibre in football's affairs is a sign of how seriously FFA and the A-League is treating the prospect of a court battle with Foxtel, the owners of Fox Sports, to enforce the remainder of the TV contract and other similar arrangements with sponsors which could also come into question. There are three seasons left to run on the current broadcast deal but Fox Sports has not given any assurances to FFA, clubs or players about the future. The uncertainty has prompted FFA and club owners to begin canvassing potential broadcasters for next season. Fox Sports is facing a major financial crisis of its own, with more than 200 workers at parent company Foxtel made redundant this week and a further 140 stood down without pay in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fox is not expected to step away from its obligations with the AFL or NRL, but has been unhappy with the ratings performance of the A-League for some time, and many recent staff cuts have included football-specific presenters, producers and journalists.

The 17-year-old midfielder is on the cusp of sealing a move to the Seagulls, where he will join Socceroos stars Mat Ryan and Aaron Mooy. After impressing at the under-17s World Cup last year, Peupion was given a chance to trial with the EPL outfit and appears to have done enough to make a permanent move to the East Sussex club.

Credit:FIFA Sydney FC sources told The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald  they were in the final stages of negotiations with Brighton to sell one of their brightest young talents, before he had made his A-League debut. The deal was on the cusp of being finalised before all football in Europe was brought to an abrupt halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic last month. However, club sources suggest the suspension of games hasn't derailed talks, with Sydney FC expecting to finalise the paperwork before the start of next season, allowing Peupion to seal a dream move to the English Premier League. Aiding the negotiations is the strong relationship between the clubs, which has been forged by Paul Reid. The former Socceroo works as an assistant at Sydney FC and oversees many of the club's transfers. Reid retains a close bond with Brighton where he spent five seasons during his playing career. There is little in the way of red tape that will delay Peupion's move abroad. He is said to hold a French passport, making him eligible to move to Brighton before the UK formally breaks away from the European Union on December 31.

Collingwood chief executive Mark Anderson said the Magpies were relying on about $7 million of cash to get through ""a really tough time'' but that if they needed further funds, they would be banking on members sticking. Collingwood will be relying on members to stay with the the club during this year's crisis.Credit:AAP He said even a club as strong as the Magpies would take ""a massive hit'' if they were not playing matches and not playing in front of crowds, with membership (85,000 in 2019) and game-day revenue accounting for 45 per cent of their revenue. Collingwood, one of six ""unassisted'' clubs that is not borrowing from the AFL, did not want to dip into their future fund of about $16.6 million, which Anderson said was established for the long-term future of the club. The club created that fund via the sale of its gaming assets. ""We had about $7 million of operational cash available to us, which is outside of the future fund, which will enable us to get through this really tough time,'' Anderson told The Age. ""But even with that strong financial position, if we're not playing matches and playing games in front of crowds at some time, even a strong financial club like us would take a massive hit. ""Our members and sponsors are pivotal to us in ensuring that were are able to stay strong, viable and independent.'' Anderson said the members to date had been sticking with the club, with one 81-year-old member from Sydney donating $10,000 in a random call to the membership department. ""He loved what the club and team's been doing and just wanted to make the donation,'' he said. ""The club members are sticking with their club and we're not seeing any trends of seeking refunds.'' Anderson said not one sponsor had asked for a discount from the club. ""Not one of our partners have approached us with a view of any level of discount discussions.'' The Collingwood chief executive said out-of-contract stars Jordan De Goey and Darcy Moore had been understanding of the situation that contracts talks were on hold – as with all contracts in the AFL – as the league works out the size of the salary cap and playing lists. ""Both of those individuals are really aware of the circumstances and understanding and so we're all just getting through at the moment. We'll pick up the conversations when we're able to. ""All those answers will need to be there before any club enters contract re-negotiations and or new contracts.'' Anderson said the staff member who recently returned from overseas infected with COVID-19 was fine and the club had ""put in really stringent protocols'' around its six teams to protect them and staff. He said Collingwood recognised that there would be a reduced soft cap on football department spending, but clearly had a preference for a soft cap, rather than a hard one, like that on player payments, that the AFL is said to be considering. ""Our preference is certainly a soft cap but we understand with that soft cap it's going to be a lesser amount.'' The AFL plans to cut the soft cap by about $3 million, to $6.7 million next year. Anderson said the Magpies had chosen not to be involved with the Amazon documentary – which is being produced for the tech giant by club president Eddie McGuire's company – because, while they were ""supportive of the concept'' and open to it in future, they wanted to ""focus on the job at hand'' without distractions.

The 33-year-old tested positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine on matchday after playing for Sandringham in May last year and has been serving a provisional suspension since June 6, 2019. Sam Gilbert in action for the Saints in 2018.Credit:AAP Gilbert had retired from the AFL at the end of 2018 after playing 208 games with the Saints, which included the 2009 and 2010 grand finals, and taken up an assistant coaching and playing role with St Kilda's VFL affiliate in 2019. However as he was playing in the VFL competition he was still subject to ASADA's anti-doping rules. ASADA investigated Gilbert and he is understood to have made submissions. However he accepted the penalty after receiving an infraction notice rather than take his case to a hearing. It was accepted in the decision to impose a two-year penalty on Gilbert that the substance was taken in a context unrelated to the sport and not in order to gain an advantage. However he was not granted a reduction on the basis of the presence of cocaine being due to no significant fault on his behalf. Several players – who were on AFL lists at the time of their positive test including Collingwood's Sam Murray and Gold Coast's Brayden Crossley – had their penalties reduced to below two years as they argued there was no significant fault. Under a revision to WADA rules to be introduced in 2021, athletes found with a metabolite for cocaine in their system on match day will not receive such lengthy suspensions, with the penalty to be reduced to three months. It's possible Gilbert could apply to have his penalty reconsidered under that new rule at the start of next year, which would allow him to coach or continue playing before June 2021. Players in the VFL who are not on AFL lists are subject to the AFL anti-doping code and random match-day testing, but they are not covered by the AFL's illicit drug code. Gilbert played his final game for the Saints in round 23, 2018 after making his debut in 2006. He became a highly regarded defender and is well respected at the club.

Now Lovett and Murrell have Haggas as their main obstacle after Young Rascal repelled another of their runners, Mugatoo, in the Manion Cup.

""Raheen House started favourite in the Ebor and was a bit disappointing to the eye, but that track got quite firm. He doesn't like firm tracks.

This is always a tricky race to assess with the two-year-olds tackling the mile for the first time but happy to take a punt on Dundeel colt  3. Azaly. The Hayes and Dabernig yard have won the past two Fernhills (Power Scheme and Futooh) and it’s obviously been some kind of target race for Azaly given he has trialled in Sydney since his eye-catching Bendigo debut over 1100m back in late February. In his Randwick trial Azaly led and although Tom Marquand, who rides the horse here too, had to shake him up, there was a response as he split Ole Kirk and Rulership. 1. Postcode did a big job at Hawkesbury last Saturday lumping 62kg to win on a heavy 9 over 1300m. The Baillieu has provided two of the past four winners of this race and race favourite 2. Untamed ran second to Holyfield in it this year.How to play it: Azaly each-way. Queen Elizabeth Stakes top pick Danon Premium is unproven on a soft or worse surface.  Credit:AAP 9. Indy Car won from an impossible spot on the Kenso first-up. The Sebring gelding was still last at the 300m mark. Punter’s Intelligence shows he ran his last 600m in 34.08s, comfortably the quickest of the meeting with an explosive 400-200 of 11.07s. There is enough speed for him to get his chance in this and he won’t be spotting such a big start this time around. The bonus is Tom Marquand in the saddle. 1. Yao Dash was confidently supported first up in the Fireball but never looked comfortable and found nothing when asked to quicken. Too classy to dismiss off one bad run.How to play it: Indy Car to win. 2. Through The Cracks motored to the line behind 10. Asharani in the Gosford qualifier run at Newcastle. He meets Asharani 1.5kg better off in the final. That was dropping back to 1200m having been so impressive at his first crack at 1400m seven weeks prior at Warwick Farm. The barrier looks ugly but it’s inconsequential with this five-year-old as he generally flops out the back anyway. That’s the negative – the start he’ll give away – but James McDonald jumps aboard replacing apprentice Jenny Duggan. He trialled brilliantly since too, splitting two group 1 winners. The market looks too heavily weighted towards the heat winners as can make a case for 1. McCormack to turn the tables on 12. Electric Girl from Kembla.How to play it: Through The Cracks to win. How much gas is still in the tank for 2. Away Game? That’s the gamble because if this iron filly holds her form, she’ll win. None of these rivals boast a record anything even close to watch she has achieved in six starts. She won the Magic Millions by a space and won the group 3 Widden just as comfortably before running a brave fourth in the Blue Diamond given the way the track played. She wasn’t done yet, running second to Farnan in the Golden Slipper. It’s two-year-old form off the very top shelf. The cautionary tale would be that Golden Slipper winner Kiamichi ran last in this race last year. 10. Rock My Wand is on the back-up after trouncing her rivals in testing conditions at Rosehill. Recent run behind Thermosphere ties in with some of the second-tier form here.How to play it: Away Game to win. Still scratching my head as to what happened to 1. Cosmic Force in the group 1 Galaxy. The three-year-old was heavily backed to start a clear favourite but, after peeling off backs at the 300m, he didn’t let down. It wasn’t anything like what we saw from the Peter and Paul Snowden-trained colt first-up when he savaged the line behind 11. Villami in the Fireball. The trial of Cosmic Force since then restored my faith that the horse is flying. With James McDonald back in the saddle, and the winkers on, Cosmic Force made light work of his rivals on the Kensington track to win by a widening seven lengths. 9. Flit is a group 1 winner over the mile but suspect she is a sprinter. Challenge for her is coming back off a 1600m run, and a very tough one when asked to lead, in the All-Star Mile.How to play it: Cosmic Force. 4. Colette was a dominant winner of the Adrian Knox and while she has yet to face a filly with the class of 1. Probabeel, she couldn’t have done much more to press in her Oaks claims in her past three starts. Profiles like she’ll relish the 2400m and Glen Boss should be able to land her forward of midfield. If she shows the same acceleration over the trip, and confident she will given the Knox was a good test being so genuinely run, just can’t see anything coming from behind her to run her down, which is what lies ahead for Probabeel. Probabeel beat Funstar first-up landing her first group 1 then ran second to that filly with Quick Thinker in third. Opie Bosson is six from eight aboard his fellow Kiwi. 9. Quintessa best smokey.How to play it: Colette to win. The Sydney Cup is no stranger to a blowout and 11. Sweet Thomas would be one of epic proportions. The eight-year-old comes through the right lead-up races, running seventh in the Manion Cup last start (finishing alongside Raheen House), but wasn’t suited by the sit-sprint set-up of that race nor the Randwick City Cup the start prior. A truly-run race here could see some big form reversals. He plummets to 51kg and four of the past five winners of the Sydney Cup have carried 52kg or less. It’s such a big advantage over the two-mile slog. The last time Sweet Thomas won a race he trounced his rivals in the German St Leger over 2800m with 60kg. If you’re still not convinced, check out his recent tickover trial where he smoked to the line. As the market suggests,2. Young Rascal is the horse to beat dropping 3kg despite winning the Manion Cup so impressively.How to play it: Sweet Thomas each-way. 2. Addeybb was outstanding in winning the group 1 Ranvet fighting back to beat 12. Verry Elleegant. They crawled in the early stages of the race with Tom Marquand clicking Addeybb up at the 800m. The six-year-old sustained his sprint right through the line, clocking the fastest last-200m section across the entire meeting. That was on a soft 5, he is even better on wetter ground. Tactics will be interesting from the inside draw as Addeybb profiles as a horse that needs galloping room to click through his gears. Verry Elleegant has the grounding of a 2400m run where she gave her rivals a galloping lesson in the Tancred but loses James McDonald who jumps on 1. Danon Premium, a Japanese import who oozes class. Has never raced on anything other than firm and good tracks. That’s the gamble. A firm track he’d be clearly on top. 10. Master Of Wine is a group 1 winner in waiting.How to play it: Addeybb to win. 17. Funstar had her Oaks mission aborted after she failed in the Vinery Stud Stakes over 2000m last start but Foxplay in 2017 and Alizee in 2018 both ran fourth in the Vinery before winning this race. There is a lot of speed engaged here which will give James McDonald the opportunity to settle the daughter of Adelaide in the second half, get her to drop her head and savage the line. She handles the wet and certainly won’t mind getting back to Randwick given her record at the track (5:3-2-0). 2. Nettoyer bloused her rivals to win the Doncaster Mile last Saturday with 51.5kg on her back. Gets back to weight-for-age now but is against her own sex.  7. Danzdanzdance is in the most suitable race she has found all campaign. The wetter the better.How to play it: Funstar to win. 14. Bangkok is flying and threatens to win a race at big odds. The five-year-old has found a very deep group 2 mares’ race but if she can settle closer and still produce the same turn of foot, she can win. First-up she didn’t get the clearest passage home but was rattling to the line behind 7. Fasika and subsequent Galaxy winner 1. Am Excited. They are both single-figure odds here. If 3. Savatiano produces her best, she’ll win.How to play it: Bangkok to win.

Challenge for her is coming back off a 1600m run, and a very tough one when asked to lead, in the All-Star Mile.How to play it: Cosmic Force. 4. Colette was a dominant winner of the Adrian Knox and while she has yet to face a filly with the class of 1. Probabeel, she couldn’t have done much more to press in her Oaks claims in her past three starts. Profiles like she’ll relish the 2400m and Glen Boss should be able to land her forward of midfield. If she shows the same acceleration over the trip, and confident she will given the Knox was a good test being so genuinely run, just can’t see anything coming from behind her to run her down, which is what lies ahead for Probabeel. Probabeel beat Funstar first-up landing her first group 1 then ran second to that filly with Quick Thinker in third. Opie Bosson is six from eight aboard his fellow Kiwi. 9. Quintessa best smokey.How to play it: Colette to win. The Sydney Cup is no stranger to a blowout and 11. Sweet Thomas would be one of epic proportions. The eight-year-old comes through the right lead-up races, running seventh in the Manion Cup last start (finishing alongside Raheen House), but wasn’t suited by the sit-sprint set-up of that race nor the Randwick City Cup the start prior. A truly-run race here could see some big form reversals. He plummets to 51kg and four of the past five winners of the Sydney Cup have carried 52kg or less. It’s such a big advantage over the two-mile slog. The last time Sweet Thomas won a race he trounced his rivals in the German St Leger over 2800m with 60kg. If you’re still not convinced, check out his recent tickover trial where he smoked to the line. As the market suggests,2. Young Rascal is the horse to beat dropping 3kg despite winning the Manion Cup so impressively.How to play it: Sweet Thomas each-way. 2. Addeybb was outstanding in winning the group 1 Ranvet fighting back to beat 12. Verry Elleegant. They crawled in the early stages of the race with Tom Marquand clicking Addeybb up at the 800m. The six-year-old sustained his sprint right through the line, clocking the fastest last-200m section across the entire meeting. That was on a soft 5, he is even better on wetter ground. Tactics will be interesting from the inside draw as Addeybb profiles as a horse that needs galloping room to click through his gears. Verry Elleegant has the grounding of a 2400m run where she gave her rivals a galloping lesson in the Tancred but loses James McDonald who jumps on 1. Danon Premium, a Japanese import who oozes class. Has never raced on anything other than firm and good tracks. That’s the gamble. A firm track he’d be clearly on top. 10. Master Of Wine is a group 1 winner in waiting.How to play it: Addeybb to win. 17. Funstar had her Oaks mission aborted after she failed in the Vinery Stud Stakes over 2000m last start but Foxplay in 2017 and Alizee in 2018 both ran fourth in the Vinery before winning this race. There is a lot of speed engaged here which will give James McDonald the opportunity to settle the daughter of Adelaide in the second half, get her to drop her head and savage the line. She handles the wet and certainly won’t mind getting back to Randwick given her record at the track (5:3-2-0). 2. Nettoyer bloused her rivals to win the Doncaster Mile last Saturday with 51.5kg on her back. Gets back to weight-for-age now but is against her own sex.  7. Danzdanzdance is in the most suitable race she has found all campaign. The wetter the better.How to play it: Funstar to win. 14. Bangkok is flying and threatens to win a race at big odds. The five-year-old has found a very deep group 2 mares’ race but if she can settle closer and still produce the same turn of foot, she can win. First-up she didn’t get the clearest passage home but was rattling to the line behind 7. Fasika and subsequent Galaxy winner 1. Am Excited. They are both single-figure odds here. If 3. Savatiano produces her best, she’ll win.How to play it: Bangkok to win.

His local course (Medallist) in Hobe Sound, Florida has remained open, however, and playing against Charlie has meant he can sharpen his competitive instincts. ""We've been able to go out there and compete,"" Woods said in an interview with streaming service GOLFTV. ""He's got a lot better at throwing the needle at me now and he's accepting it faster and reversing it back. We have a deal, in the backyard generally every night we'll play putting matches and the winner gets to keep the green jacket in the closet. ""Occasionally it's gone into his closet.

As a defending champion, the build-up to the Masters is unique. Not being able to host the Champions Dinner, or enjoy the par-three event held the day before, has left a void. Woods held an improvised Champions Dinner at home with partner Erica Herman and children Charlie and Sam instead. ""We had exactly the same. We had steak and chicken pieces, sushi and sashimi,"" Woods, who battled back from knee and back injuries to claim his 15th major at Augusta last year, said.

75,/sport/netball/world-cup-format-in-super-netball-mix-20200409-p54ilj.html,World Cup format in Super Netball mix,"Super Netball will consider bringing teams together to play off in a World Cup-style format as a last resort to complete the 2020 season after its coronavirus postponement. The eight-team national competition has been delayed until at least the end of June and chief executive Chris Symington says a range of scenarios are being explored dependent on when they can begin play. The coronavirus crisis has put the NSW Swifts' Super Netball title defence on hold.Credit:AAP ""We are still working to get an understanding of what's possible from a logistical point of view and also what's achievable for our teams and our broadcaster,"" Symington said. The competition was set to begin on May 2 and run over 14 rounds (or 18 weeks) including a split round and three weeks of finals. Symington said there was no ""drop-dead"" date for the competition to begin and felt netball had an advantage over competitions such as AFL and NRL because the lack of physical contact meant multiple games could be played within a shorter period. ""Given the nature of the sport there is the ability to potentially play mid-week, so you could condense and run a shorter version of the season – so the same amount of matches but over a shorter time frame,"" Symington said. ""That could halve our time frame to eight weeks because you could also look at packaging our three weeks of finals into one weekend or sudden death play-offs, so that's also on the table."" He said that a Netball World Cup tournament-style approach was also a possibility. ""That's something we could potentially do and capture as much content as we could in that time-frame without placing too much load on the athletes,"" Symington said. ""They would probably all go to a single location – where that is is anyone's guess at this stage. ""But you could take all teams to a single location as you would for a World Cup ... and you play a tournament style with multiple matches within a short period of time. ""That's a last resort based on timing toward the end of the year."" Symington recognised there could be some broadcasting challenges among a packed sporting schedule toward the end of the year with their free-to-air partner Nine Network also committed to the NRL.

76,/sport/netball/world-cup-format-in-super-netball-mix-20200409-p54ilj.html,World Cup format in Super Netball mix,"Super Netball will consider bringing teams together to play off in a World Cup-style format as a last resort to complete the 2020 season after its coronavirus postponement. The eight-team national competition has been delayed until at least the end of June and chief executive Chris Symington says a range of scenarios are being explored dependent on when they can begin play. The coronavirus crisis has put the NSW Swifts' Super Netball title defence on hold.Credit:AAP ""We are still working to get an understanding of what's possible from a logistical point of view and also what's achievable for our teams and our broadcaster,"" Symington said. The competition was set to begin on May 2 and run over 14 rounds (or 18 weeks) including a split round and three weeks of finals. Symington said there was no ""drop-dead"" date for the competition to begin and felt netball had an advantage over competitions such as AFL and NRL because the lack of physical contact meant multiple games could be played within a shorter period. ""Given the nature of the sport there is the ability to potentially play mid-week, so you could condense and run a shorter version of the season – so the same amount of matches but over a shorter time frame,"" Symington said. ""That could halve our time frame to eight weeks because you could also look at packaging our three weeks of finals into one weekend or sudden death play-offs, so that's also on the table."" He said that a Netball World Cup tournament-style approach was also a possibility. ""That's something we could potentially do and capture as much content as we could in that time-frame without placing too much load on the athletes,"" Symington said. ""They would probably all go to a single location – where that is is anyone's guess at this stage. ""But you could take all teams to a single location as you would for a World Cup ... and you play a tournament style with multiple matches within a short period of time. ""That's a last resort based on timing toward the end of the year."" Symington recognised there could be some broadcasting challenges among a packed sporting schedule toward the end of the year with their free-to-air partner Nine Network also committed to the NRL. ""There's no doubt there's potential for a bottleneck to occur at the back half of the year when the shackles hopefully come off,"" he said.

Brian Borruso said in court papers on Tuesday he tried to take a selfie as Woods approached his tee shot left of the 13th green in the third round at Innisbrook. Replay   But Joe LaCava ""intentionally shoved"" him, causing him to stumble and fall into the crowd. Josh Drechsel, the lawyer representing Borruso, said the lawsuit was filed two years after the tournament to get a better understanding of the injuries, described in the lawsuit as ""either permanent or continuing."" Mark Steinberg, the agent for Woods at Excel Sports Management, did not immediately reply to a text seeking comment. LaCava said he had no comment. Tiger Woods' caddie Joe LaCava has been accused of ""intentionally shoving"" a fan.Credit:AP Drechsel, meanwhile, issued a public plea for evidence from fans who might have been at the 13th green that day and witnessed the incident. One video Dreshsel has shows LaCava approaching the fans with his left arm extended saying: ""You've got to back it up."" Drechsel says he wants to find the fans who could be heard on another video. ""One says, 'I love Tiger, but I don't like him' and another voice is heard saying, 'He just pushed him. He just shoved him right out of there.'"" The lawsuit says Borruso went to the hospital to be treated for his injuries. Woods played the Valspar Championship for the first time in 2018, a key event in his return from back surgeries. Before record crowds, at times standing a dozen rows deep around tee boxes, he came within one putt on the 18th hole of forcing a play-off and finished one shot behind Paul Casey. Woods was named as a defendant because he employs LaCava, who previously was the long-time caddie for Fred Couples and began working for Woods in the autumn of 2011. Drechsel said he asked the PGA Tour for video from the tournament but said the tour told him it was unable to provide any without a court order. AP Copyright © 2020", Doug Ferguson ,"April 9, 2020"
