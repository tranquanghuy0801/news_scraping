With astonishing swiftness, the pandemic has shut down both long-standing and new businesses, leaving veteran workers and recent hires in nearly every type of industry without a pay cheque. In just three weeks, more than 16 million US workers have lost their jobs — more losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The US economy has been paralysed by the coronavirus.Credit:AP It's as if ""the economy as a whole has fallen into some sudden black hole,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics. Many Wall Street analysts concede that at this point, forecasts are not much more than guesses: The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted. Given the current information, though, several economists expect that by the end of the month more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work, pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 per cent. In February, it was 3.5 per cent, a result of 113 straight months of job growth. The country's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the goods and services produced, could fall this quarter at an annual rate of as much as 35 per cent from the preceding three months. It is clear that this quarter will be ""really terrible,"" Bostjancic said. ""We just don't know the degree of terribleness."" The weekly tally of people filing claims is one of the best measures of the virus' effect on the labour force, but it does not capture the full extent of the joblessness. Despite feverish efforts in many states to expand staffing and upgrade technological capacity, unemployment offices have been vastly overpowered by demand. Applicants in several of the hardest-hit places, like New York and California, say they've made dozens of attempts — even hundreds — to get through online or by telephone. Some have still not succeeded. In addition, directives to stay at home took effect only last week in many states. Florida and Texas, which together account for 15 per cent of the nation's payrolls, decided midweek to close nonessential businesses. As a result, the spike in claims in those states may not show up in the Labor Department's report until next week. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted Kendall Clark, an information technology recruiter said she had not managed to file despite more than 1200 attempts, some at 1am. ""For now, I don't really know what else to do,"" said Clark, who lives with her husband and two sons. ""I'm stuck, I'm frustrated, and I don't really know where to go from here. ""The plan is that we don't pay some bills but pay the mortgage so we don't lose the house,"" she said. Although each state sets the level and duration of its unemployment benefits, the federal $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) emergency relief act passed two weeks ago expanded the program, widening eligibility and extending the period for compensation. Virtually no industry has been immune to job cuts.Credit:Bloomberg Those payments will be crucial in helping families survive the crisis, said Robert G. Valletta, senior vice president and associate director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""It's exactly the kind of bridge that we need to make sure people are able to maintain some level of household stability and come out of this without complete devastation,"" he said.   Getting money immediately into the hands of people who need it not only helps households buy groceries and pay rent during an acute crisis but also aids in the economy's recovery. ""That helps to keep establishments open and running,"" said Cathy Barrera, founding economist of the Prysm Group, and that could help prevent a short, sharp shock from turning into a prolonged slump after the epidemic ebbs. The government's relief package — which includes low-interest loans and grants for businesses, ready cash for individuals and expanded unemployment insurance — was enacted with that goal in mind. Individuals should soon start receiving $US1200 emergency assistance checks. But Barrera worries that the expanded unemployment benefits won't come through rapidly enough. ""I am concerned that the way this relief has been channelled through the existing unemployment insurance system — which can be difficult to access in an expedient way — can be causing us some problems,"" she said. Several states, including Connecticut, have warned that cheques could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others, like Florida, start benefits only when a claim is filed, regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for example, allows workers who don't normally qualify — like independent contractors, part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others, Kandy Thomas, a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City, found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that ""these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the US Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs."" ""There's nothing for someone like me,"" Thomas said. ""As soon as you say you're self-employed, you're done."" Normally, most states offer roughly half of a worker's previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $US215, and just 9 per cent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $US550, and 57 per cent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $US600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks. Workers in the country illegally and those newly entering the labor force remain ineligible. The New York Times Copyright © 2020"," Patricia Cohen , Tiffany Hsu ","April 10, 2020"

Trump is on the verge of getting the deal he wants without taking steps to ratchet down US production.Credit:AP In other words, Trump may win a global oil agreement by letting the market work. ""The US is already effectively cutting because we cut in response to market force,"" said James Lucier, managing director of research firm Capital Alpha Partners LLC. ""We're not a state oil corporation; we're not government-directed producers of oil. US oil production has an automatic response to excess supply, which is to shut in"" that production. The Trump administration is likely to take that argument to a virtual meeting of Group of 20 energy ministers Friday, as non-OPEC countries face pressure to come up with another 5 million barrels per day in oil production cuts. For more than a week, Trump has talked up the prospect of a Russia-Saudi agreement to reduce oil output by at least 10 million barrels per day. He resisted calls to force deep cuts in US crude production in tandem with Middle East producers.

And the Energy Department offered numbers to prove its case. A short-term outlook released earlier this week underscored that two million barrels per day of oil production are already expected to be lost - without any government intervention. Of course, Trump also has limited tools to force production cuts. He could quash 2.9 million barrels per day of oil production by halting the activity on federal lands. And a ban on US crude exports could take care of another 3 million to 4 million barrels per day, according to Rapidan Energy Group. Trump's laissez-faire approach has been ""an effective bargaining position,"" Lucier said.

The central bank announced programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses as the country tips into what economists say may be the worst recession in decades. It's the latest unprecedented move by the Fed, which has rushed to ensure cash gets to parts of the economy that need it after markets got snarled by a rush of investors pulling cash out of the system. For the week, the S&P 500 jumped 12.1 per cent, its best performance since late 1974.Credit:AP The stock market is not the economy, and that distinction has become even more clear this week. The S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent Thursday, the same day the government announced 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week as layoffs sweep the nation. For the week, the S&P 500 jumped 12.1 per cent, its best performance since late 1974. Markets will be closed for Good Friday. Stock investors are continuously looking ahead to where the economy will be a few months or more in the future. From mid-February through late March, they sent stocks down by a third on expectations that a steep recession was imminent, before the economy really began to crunch. In the last few weeks, though, investors have sent the market back up more than 20 per cent following promises for massive aid from the Fed, other central banks and governments around the world, even as evidence piles up that the recession fears were prescient. This week, some investors have begun to look ahead to the economy possibly reopening amid signs the outbreak may be peaking or plateauing in several of the world's hardest hit areas. ""The market is solely focused on the number of cases,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""The question is when can the restrictions be lifted? That's what the market is focused on, when does America open up for business again?"" The S&P 500 rose 39.84 points to 2,789.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 285.80, or 1.2 per cent, to 23,719.37, and the Nasdaq climbed 62.67, or 0.8 per cent, to 8,153.58.. Many professional investors have been sceptical of the rally, saying there is still too much uncertainty. They say predictions for a relatively quick economic rebound are overly optimistic, and the head of the International Monetary Fund said Thursday the global economy is set for its deepest recession since the Great Depression.. While hopes are building that a plateau may be arriving for infections in several hotspots, it's not assured. In the meantime, businesses continue to shut down and one in 10 U.S. workers has lost their jobs in the last three weeks. ""You typically have very strong rebounds, even in a bear market,"" Krosby said of markets where stocks have fallen more than 20 per cent. ""The question is whether or not we see selling into this rebound, or can we continue to build on it."" The market's big gains this week have been somewhat tentative. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 charged to an early 3.5 per cent gain before it disappeared in the final minutes of trading. On Thursday, the index nearly gave up all of an early 2.5 per cent gain, paring it down to 0.5 per cent before climbing again in the last hour of trading. Such volatility has become routine in markets at the end of each week recently. ""People are a little nervous to hold risk going into the weekend, especially a 72-hour weekend,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist with TD Ameritrade. The afternoon's fade also coincided with another abrupt downdraft in the price of oil. Benchmark US crude oil fell $US2.33, or 9.3 per cent, to settle at $US22.76 per barrel after being above $US28 earlier on speculation that big oil producers were set to announce a sharp cutback in production. Demand for energy has withered as economies shut down to slow the spread of the virus, and the world is awash in oil. Brent crude fell $US1.36, or 4.1 per cent, to $US31.48 per barrel. The Fed's immense programs announced Thursday touch far-reaching corners of lending markets, and if they continue for the long term, they could eventually lead to market bubbles. But in the short term, ""what the Fed is doing is great and helping markets function and providing liquidity so investors can do what they need (and) want to do,"" said Warren Pierson, deputy chief investment officer at Baird Advisors. The programs even include bonds for companies that have weak enough credit ratings to be called ""junk,"" or speculative grade. Worries have been high about the ballooning amount of corporate debt concentrated at the bottom edge of high-quality ""investment grade."" The looming recession could push a lot of that into ""junk"" status, which would force many investors to sell it because they're required to hold only investment-grade bonds. A run from such bonds could trigger sell-offs in other areas of the market and lead to even more pain across the economy. Also in the Fed's programs are municipal bonds, which allow cities and state governments to raise cash. On a normal day, trading in the market might see 15 buyers make a bid for a particular bond. But as recently as a few weeks ago, there were 15 sellers for every buyer, according to Gabe Diederich, portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management. All the difficulty in selling caused prices to tumble more than they otherwise should, even for high-quality bonds. That makes it more difficult for local governments to borrow.

6,/business/the-economy/power-chief-pushes-home-battery-stimulus-to-aid-virus-recovery-20200409-p54ikh.html,Power chief pushes home battery stimulus to aid virus recovery,"The head of Australia's largest power provider, AGL, has recommended making installations of household batteries and smart meters a key plank of the federal government's post-lockdown stimulus response. AGL chief executive Brett Redman said the company has raised the proposed subsidy package in talks with the Morrison government about areas that could be considered for stimulus funds to ""get the economy moving"" in the immediate post-lockdown phase. AGL's Brett Redman says batteries and smart meters should be considered for coronavirus stimulus funding.Credit:Justin McManus ""The government is doing the right thing by pushing enormous amounts of stimulus through to make sure people can stay engaged with their workforces,"" Mr Redman said. ""At the right time, government and business will need to turn their attention to defining and then implementing our plans for generating jobs across all sectors and getting the economy back onto a growth path."" Mr Redman told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald the proposal could provide desperately needed assistance to struggling electrical contractors as well as power bill relief for consumers. He added that home battery systems, which store energy from solar panels, and digital meters for consumers to monitor their energy use were being rapidly adopted by households across the market and should be considered for targeted subsidies. ""Why not accelerate that as ways of creating immediate work out there in the workforce?"" Installations of household batteries across Australia are on the rise, with more than 22,000 new systems last year. The battery market is heavily reliant on a mix of state and federal government subsidies. AGL does not immediately profit from installations but could benefit in the long term by acquiring new customer accounts. Mr Redman said electrical contractors that performed battery installations would be hard-hit during the economic downturn inflicted by the pandemic and stimulus could help them stay afloat. ""It's in everyone's interests that they survive, and survive in good shape, for when the economy recovers,"" Mr Redman said. Increasing uptake of the technology would also have wider benefits, he said, ""first for the grid but also for households by helping reduce their energy costs"". Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the government's priorities were ensuring energy reliability amid the pandemic and providing relief to distressed households through expanded hardship provisions. ""I welcome the commitment from the energy sector so far, but we must be resolute in our focus and that must be helping those in most need right now,"" he said. Electrical contractors said a government-backed program to support battery storage installations would support the economy, help smaller companies keep staff in jobs and reduce people's energy bills. ""And in the current crisis, this is critical,"" said Suresh Manickam of the National Electrical and Communications Association, a trade group representing 5400 contractors. However, Mr Manickam stressed it was important that any such scheme was only accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises that had been adversely affected by the economic downturn.

AGL chief executive Brett Redman said the company has raised the proposed subsidy package in talks with the Morrison government about areas that could be considered for stimulus funds to ""get the economy moving"" in the immediate post-lockdown phase. AGL's Brett Redman says batteries and smart meters should be considered for coronavirus stimulus funding.Credit:Justin McManus ""The government is doing the right thing by pushing enormous amounts of stimulus through to make sure people can stay engaged with their workforces,"" Mr Redman said. ""At the right time, government and business will need to turn their attention to defining and then implementing our plans for generating jobs across all sectors and getting the economy back onto a growth path."" Mr Redman told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald the proposal could provide desperately needed assistance to struggling electrical contractors as well as power bill relief for consumers. He added that home battery systems, which store energy from solar panels, and digital meters for consumers to monitor their energy use were being rapidly adopted by households across the market and should be considered for targeted subsidies. ""Why not accelerate that as ways of creating immediate work out there in the workforce?"" Installations of household batteries across Australia are on the rise, with more than 22,000 new systems last year. The battery market is heavily reliant on a mix of state and federal government subsidies. AGL does not immediately profit from installations but could benefit in the long term by acquiring new customer accounts. Mr Redman said electrical contractors that performed battery installations would be hard-hit during the economic downturn inflicted by the pandemic and stimulus could help them stay afloat. ""It's in everyone's interests that they survive, and survive in good shape, for when the economy recovers,"" Mr Redman said. Increasing uptake of the technology would also have wider benefits, he said, ""first for the grid but also for households by helping reduce their energy costs"". Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the government's priorities were ensuring energy reliability amid the pandemic and providing relief to distressed households through expanded hardship provisions. ""I welcome the commitment from the energy sector so far, but we must be resolute in our focus and that must be helping those in most need right now,"" he said. Electrical contractors said a government-backed program to support battery storage installations would support the economy, help smaller companies keep staff in jobs and reduce people's energy bills. ""And in the current crisis, this is critical,"" said Suresh Manickam of the National Electrical and Communications Association, a trade group representing 5400 contractors. However, Mr Manickam stressed it was important that any such scheme was only accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises that had been adversely affected by the economic downturn. Kane Thornton of the Clean Energy Council, which represents renewable energy companies, backed the calls for a stimulus package targeting clean energy technology.

Gorman, 61, started to feel sick in mid-March, he said. After getting tested and confirmed as having COVID-19, he self-isolated at home but did not stop leading regular calls with Morgan Stanley's operating committee and board of directors, nor did he experience severe symptoms, he said. Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman revealed the news in a 10-minute video to staff. Credit:Bloomberg His disclosure in a 10-minute video emailed to staff is one example of how and when financial firms are choosing to disclose sensitive health information during a global pandemic that has sickened half a million people, upended the global economy, and put banks at the centre of relief efforts for any potential recovery. The US Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to disclose material facts to the public, but there is widespread debate about when corporations must disclose information about the health of an executive, corporate governance lawyers said. Last month, Jefferies Financial Group Inc disclosed its chief financial officer, Peg Broadbent, died of complications related to the coronavirus. Perella Weinberg Partners LP founding partner Joseph Perella also tested positive for the coronavirus and recovered after treatment, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorised to discuss the information publicly. A spokeswoman said it is the firm's policy not comment on the health of its employees. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co disclosed that Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had emergency heart surgery within hours of the event happening last month. Other CEOs – including Juan Domingo Beckmann Legorreta of Jose Cuervo tequila-owner Becle , Jeff Shell of Comcast-owned NBC Universal and Glenn Fogel of online travel agency Booking Holdings – each received diagnoses of coronavirus infections and disclosed them shortly after. Gorman’s staff-wide video was the first time Morgan Stanley shared with anyone beyond the board room and executive suite that its CEO had tested positive for the respiratory disease. It became public knowledge once news outlets including Reuters learned of the message. A CEO of a major global financial firm developing an infection would naturally shake investors, employees and customers, but disclosure for SEC purposes is not always necessary, lawyers said. ""There is no specific requirement to disclose when an executive becomes sick, unless the information is material ... such as if the executive is unable to continue to perform even if only temporarily,"" said Michael Hermsen, a Chicago-based partner at Mayer Brown, who previously worked in the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance.

The company's first significant cut in A320-family output, to 40 jets a month, brings production to the lowest level since 2012 and will be implemented in May or June, unions said. Onlookers believe Airbus will have to cut more in the future. Credit:Bloomberg Airbus shares, which have fallen around 50 per cent this year due to the crisis, wobbled on Thursday but ended up 2 per cent as several analysts said the company had acted swiftly to reset output. But with all but a handful of airlines shunning deliveries as they hoard cash to survive the crisis, several industry officials and economists suggested the rate may be optimistic. ""We have too many planes,"" said Avitas senior vice-president Adam Pilarski, who has long warned of a jet market bubble - though nothing on the scale of the meltdown in air travel seen since quarantines rippled across the globe last month. Airlines are warning of $US252 billion ($398 billion) in lost revenues and 38 per cent lower traffic, many times higher than past corrections. With Boeing's competing 737 MAX still grounded after more than a year of safety reviews following two accidents, Airbus signalled on Wednesday that it was ready to act again if needed. ""It is a first step,"" said Rob Morris, chief consultant at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, adding more reductions could be needed because of a large potential jet surplus. That contrasts with 2001 when Boeing cut output sharply after 9/11 attacks, while Airbus - reluctant then as now to cut output due to rigid European labour laws - spotted an opening with upstart budget carriers and went on a selling spree. The travel industry has been savaged by the coronavirus pandemic. Credit:Getty Images One such carrier, easyJet, is now one of Airbus's top customers and says it is deferring deliveries. On Wednesday, Airbus was forced by the scale of the crisis to act as Boeing's 737 MAX remained grounded for safety reasons - having also played an unplanned role in curtailing supply that one source likened to a ""spent shock-absorber"". Airbus ""will have to share the (market) pain with Boeing,"" Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said in a recent note. To defend its new output rate, experts said Airbus appeared to be banking on a sharp increase in retirements of older jets, echoing moves seen after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis. Airlines have an incentive in bad times to idle jets early to avoid costly scheduled repair visits. But low oil prices like those seen today tend to push airlines in the other direction. According to Ascend by Cirium, the new Airbus target assumes every plane delivered this year will replace an older one being taken out of service. That suggests borrowing some demand from future years when some of those jets were due to be retired. Other tools used in past crises include pressure on leasing companies to take delivery. They place large speculative orders for good prices and are expected to pull their weight in a downturn - but they too are reeling as airlines hand back jets. Even so, market sources said, Airbus will need to make use of its relatively strong balance sheet to spur deliveries by providing finance to airlines or offering advances or discounts. Unlike in past downturns, the industry is currently facing a fundamental drop in demand everywhere, meaning there is little room for error if Airbus's output calculations go awry. ""Right now it looks like a tug of war between Airbus and airlines to see who should store some of those planes,"" an aircraft finance veteran said, asking not to be named.

Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the health crisis. Virgin will only fly one return service between Sydney and Melbourne a day. Credit:Edwina Pickles The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin will continue to operate government-funded international flights to bring stranded Australians home and charter flights. “As a result of government restrictions, less people are travelling and we have made changes to our schedules to reflect this,” a Virgin spokesman said in a statement. “We continue to operate a daily service between Melbourne and Sydney, provide cargo transport locally and overseas, and operate charter flights including assisting the government in bringing Australians home.” Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Qantas is also operating a significantly reduced domestic network, and is flying Sydney to Melbourne only five times a week compared to 50 times a day before the pandemic. Qantas continues to operate to each capital city and 25 regional destinations, however, at reduced frequencies. It said on Thursday it was set to carry 95 per cent fewer passengers this Easter compared to last year. ""We’ve further cut our domestic flights because of various travel restrictions and their impact on demand,"" a Qantas spokesman said. ""Earlier this week we had some flights with only a handful of passengers on board,which just isn’t sustainable."" The larger airline has stood down around 20,000 workers. Federal Transport Minister Michael McCormack said on Thursday he acknowledged Qantas and Virgin had ""significantly reduced their domestic and international services"", and that he continued to ""talk to airline executives on a regular basis as we navigate this unprecedented situation"".

Credit:AP Professor Cuthbertson added that it was important to recognise vaccines under development could fail at any stage, and that it would be 12 to 18 months before one could pass clinical trials and be made available to protect the public. The public health measures put in place in the interim were what had kept infections below a level that would overwhelm Australia's healthcare system, he said, and any relaxation had to be done carefully and gradually. It would be crazy to just withdraw everything all at once,"" Professor Cuthbertson said. ""It would be a series of careful steps to make sure we don’t have a second wave of infection that would be absolutely devastating and could overwhelm the health system.” The chief executive of ASX-listed regenerative medicine company Mesoblast, Dr Silviu Itescu, backed that sentiment, saying on Thursday that Australians must not become complacent even if a vaccine became available. “This is a viral infection that will stay with us. It’s not going to go away.” Any calls to relax social-distancing laws at this point were misguided, he said. “Over the next two months, this is not the time to be relaxing. I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming.” Professor Cuthbertson said about two-thirds of the population needed to become immune to COVID-19 for it to be contained – preferably by being vaccinated but that also included people who had contracted the virus and then recovered. CSL, the most valuable company on the ASX, said on Thursday that it had put its other clinical trials on hold, and Professor Cuthbertson said it had manufacturing capacity to produce enough vaccine for Australia by the time it passed clinical trials. CSL has also started work on “hyperimmune” therapies for COVID-19 patients at risk of developing critical symptoms or for high-risk individuals such as healthcare workers, made with antibodies harvested from the blood of patients who had contracted and then recovered from COVID-19. Professor Cuthbertson said those therapies could be produced in just a few months, but in smaller quantities than a vaccine given the reliance on collecting blood. He said CSL was talking to Red Cross Lifeblood and the Department of Health about starting to collect blood from convalescent patients. CSL is also working with a global alliance of plasma therapy companies on producing hyperimmune therapies, as well as with American company SAB Therapeutics on harvesting antibodies to tackle COVID-19 from the blood of genetically modified cows.

22,/business/markets/we-shouldn-t-read-too-much-into-sharemarkets-rallying-our-economic-crisis-has-just-begun-20200410-p54isu.html,"We shouldn't read too much into sharemarkets rallying, our economic crisis has just begun","Sharemarkets have staged a significant recovery from the coronavirus slump, rallying sharply from lows hit in March. But gains of 10 per cent or more are common in bear markets - and the crisis at many of the world's businesses has only just begun. A wave of insolvencies will puncture the optimism, as companies with too much debt fail to remain afloat. There will be some individual winners that have seen demand soar, but earnings will slump at most that escape going bust. In fact, the fall in company profits this year will probably be more severe than at the height of the last financial crisis. Global sharemarkets have recovered some losses after being crippled in March, but investors need to stay cautious.Credit:AP People's behaviour and spending will not return to normal after restrictions on movements are lifted. In Wuhan, where the lockdown has been eased, people are still cautious. All this pain will be reflected in economic data releases scheduled over the next six months. It's hard to see the optimism surviving as the reality is being revealed. One of the main drivers of the recent market recovery has been positive headlines about easing infection and death rates in countries such as Italy. This news is, obviously, very welcome indeed. But the virus is still spreading in countries worldwide - and they are each using different methodologies to measure cases and fatalities. Some countries also have bottlenecks in reporting, as saving lives is more important than paperwork when you are at the front line. All of this means that infection and death rates are probably under-reported - and differences in the type of information collected means it's difficult to compare data from one country to the next. For an investor trying to make an informed decision, the data-uncertainty problem is all encompassing. The length of any lockdown will determine the extent of the fallout, but we still do not know how long these will last. This means that any forecasts of economic performance or a company's profits are no more than guesstimates. Nobody has the data from which they can make an accurate call. Governments have some very tricky decisions to make, as they attempt a delicate balancing act between health and wealth. In the UK, the initial lockdown was supposed to last three weeks, but a review of this decision has been postponed. Edward Argar, the health minister, has warned that there is now no date set for a review. This recent market rally was also driven by hopes of phased releases from lockdown starting soon. Right now, this appears unlikely. We are probably going to see lockdowns for longer than hoped. Restrictions on movement in France are set to continue. France went into lockdown on March 17, and it has already been extended once to April 15. But it is almost certain that there will be an extension, as Édouard Philippe, the prime minister, has already warned. The Bank of France expects to see a 6 per cent GDP contraction in the first quarter, the biggest slump since the Second World War. Even this could be optimistic and the impact in the second quarter will probably be even worse. The situation in the US is of great concern given the country's slow initial response, lack of testing and its economic importance to global trade and markets. The world's largest economy has recorded by far the most COVID-19 infections of any country, with the total now almost five times that of China. California, one of the country's most significant economic engines, has not suffered as badly as places such as New York. But authorities indicate that its lockdown will be extended after they revised their estimate for the virus peak in the state from mid-April to the middle or end of May. It is likely that there will be more restrictions introduced across America. So, we are uncertain about data relating to the number of infections. The economic implications of shutdowns remain unclear because there's no way of predicting how long they will last. The impact on companies is therefore difficult to predict. Management at many companies have withdrawn guidance on sales and profitability, so analysts trying to work out what will happen to earnings have a challenge here too. Economic data releases are only now starting to give an indication of the virus's initial impact, but we are now entering a period of gloomy headlines as the data catches up with the acceleration of the crisis. The sharp rise in unemployment globally is also likely to hit consumer confidence, with spending being significantly reined in. Given the speed at which the global economy is entering a recession we need the second quarter's economic data and corporate earnings to be out in the open before a much more constructive stance is appropriate. A good rule of thumb is that equity markets tend to find a firm footing roughly one quarter before the end of a recession. This doesn't look likely soon, although a buy signal will eventually materialise. However, this bear-market rally has provided investors with one opportunity: the jump in equities has given a chance to exit riskier positions in companies that are over-leveraged or face trouble ahead. Data uncertainty means now is not the right time to buy for the long term, now is the time to adjust and prepare. The chances of a new low remain high.

23,/business/markets/asia-s-tycoons-are-seeking-bargains-after-the-coronavirus-market-rout-20200409-p54int.html,Asia's tycoons are seeking bargains after the coronavirus market rout,"Asian tycoons are looking to snap up assets pummelled by the deadly coronavirus at bargain prices, but they are also facing hurdles as more governments seek to deter foreign takeovers of local firms. Over the past three months, top executives of companies based in mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore have told investors that they are looking for acquisitions. They include Victor Li, who took over Hong Kong's CK group from his father Li Ka-shing two years ago, and billionaire Guo Guangchang, the founder of the acquisitive Chinese conglomerate, Fosun Group. On the lookout for coronavirus bargains: CK Hutchison Holdings Chairman Victor Li.Credit:Bloomberg Major stock indexes in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific all plunged about 20 per cent in the first quarter in their worst rout since the 2008 financial crisis, making retail chains to hotels and property developers attractive to suitors. Cash-rich conglomerates like Li's CK group are in a position to invest when others struggle as they are built to defend against the bad times, said Jonathan Galligan, group deputy head of research at CLSA Ltd. ""This is a tremendous opportunity for any company with cash,"" Galligan said. ""If you look at what's happened in the global market, right now cash is king."" The junior Li, now chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings, CK Asset Holdings and CK Infrastructure Holdings, told analysts on March 19 that the group's cash flow and balance sheet are strong and the impact of the virus offers ""opportunities to look at new acquisitions."" He didn't elaborate. For the 55-year-old Li, the market rout has come as his biggest test since his father passed on the baton in May 2018. The now retired senior Li, 91, came to Hong Kong as a refugee but went on to transform a plastic flower business into a ports-to-telecommunications empire spanning the world. CK Hutchison, the main flagship whose stock has tumbled 24 per cent this year, said it had HK$145 billion ($30 billion) of cash and liquid investments as of December. That is 3.6 times its short-term debt and 1.7 times its debt maturing over 2020 and 2021, according to S&P Global Ratings. The group spent $US5.5 billion ($8.8 billion) last year acquiring assets including British pub operator Greene King, following about $US15.2 billion of purchases the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The chaos triggered by the disease is also posing another challenge for prospective buyers. Governments are preemptively trying to ward off predatory buying, with politicians from Australia to Spain, Italy and Germany introducing or considering stricter rules to help shield strategically important domestic companies. CK's bid to buy Aussie pipeline operator APA Group was knocked back on national security grounds.Credit:James Davies The regulatory barriers may make some acquisitions harder, far from the days when Chinese conglomerates such as HNA Group loaded up on debt and paid top dollar for assets from US technology firms to European aviation businesses. ""For companies like Li's, they depend very much on acquisitions to grow, and that could be a big challenge in the long term,"" said Jackie Yan, an assistant professor in management and strategy at the University of Hong Kong. Li, however, is no stranger to rejections by overseas regulators. In 2018, Australia rejected CK's bid to buy infrastructure giant APA Group, which operates gas pipelines, for $13 billion on national security concerns. Had it been successful, that would've been CK's biggest overseas purchase. A representative for the CK group didn't respond to a request for comments. In its wake, the pandemic is likely to leave behind many ruined businesses after billions of people spent days in lock-downs and curtailed spending. In the US, 50,000 retail stores have shut in just over a week. More than half of Britain's firms have just three months' cash in reserve or less, according to a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce. The International Finance Corp. said last week that it had received 315 requests for financing from companies and small- and medium-sized enterprises in 70 countries. The MSCI Europe Consumer Discretionary Index, comprising stocks such as Adidas, Daimler and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has declined 27 per cent this year. Even a world index that represents telecommunications, utilities and energy companies -- sectors that tend to demonstrate inelastic demand patterns, stable, predictable returns -- has dropped 16 per cent. Fosun International's Chairman Guo said on March 31 that the company will leverage its worldwide resources to identify opportunities. The company had 93.6 billion yuan ($21.3 billion) in cash and equivalents last year, compared with 82.7 billion yuan of short-term debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The group is into health care, insurance and hospitality. This is a tremendous opportunity for any company with cash. If you look at what's happened in the global market, right now cash is king. Singapore's biggest developer, CapitaLand, which bought Arlington Business Park in the UK in February, is seeking similar ""counter cyclical"" opportunities amid the virus downturn, its Chief Financial Officer Andrew Lim told analysts the same month. CLSA's Galligan also said that should the economic pain intensify, some countries may even welcome investments. ""In this market dislocation, our long-term approach means that we can hunt for mispriced companies with solid fundamentals,"" Todd Barlow, head of Sydney investment holding company Washington H. Soul Pattinson, said in an earnings call last month.  Bloomberg Copyright © 2020", Shirley Zhao ,"April 10, 2020"

With astonishing swiftness, the pandemic has shut down both long-standing and new businesses, leaving veteran workers and recent hires in nearly every type of industry without a pay cheque. In just three weeks, more than 16 million US workers have lost their jobs — more losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The US economy has been paralysed by the coronavirus.Credit:AP It's as if ""the economy as a whole has fallen into some sudden black hole,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief US financial economist at Oxford Economics. Many Wall Street analysts concede that at this point, forecasts are not much more than guesses: The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted. Given the current information, though, several economists expect that by the end of the month more than 20 million people will have been thrown out of work, pushing the unemployment rate toward 15 per cent. In February, it was 3.5 per cent, a result of 113 straight months of job growth. The country's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the goods and services produced, could fall this quarter at an annual rate of as much as 35 per cent from the preceding three months. It is clear that this quarter will be ""really terrible,"" Bostjancic said. ""We just don't know the degree of terribleness."" The weekly tally of people filing claims is one of the best measures of the virus' effect on the labour force, but it does not capture the full extent of the joblessness. Despite feverish efforts in many states to expand staffing and upgrade technological capacity, unemployment offices have been vastly overpowered by demand. Applicants in several of the hardest-hit places, like New York and California, say they've made dozens of attempts — even hundreds — to get through online or by telephone. Some have still not succeeded. In addition, directives to stay at home took effect only last week in many states. Florida and Texas, which together account for 15 per cent of the nation's payrolls, decided midweek to close nonessential businesses. As a result, the spike in claims in those states may not show up in the Labor Department's report until next week. The purposeful and sudden halt in economic activity has no precedent, and no one knows when the restrictions on movement and commerce will be lifted Kendall Clark, an information technology recruiter said she had not managed to file despite more than 1200 attempts, some at 1am. ""For now, I don't really know what else to do,"" said Clark, who lives with her husband and two sons. ""I'm stuck, I'm frustrated, and I don't really know where to go from here. ""The plan is that we don't pay some bills but pay the mortgage so we don't lose the house,"" she said. Although each state sets the level and duration of its unemployment benefits, the federal $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) emergency relief act passed two weeks ago expanded the program, widening eligibility and extending the period for compensation. Virtually no industry has been immune to job cuts.Credit:Bloomberg Those payments will be crucial in helping families survive the crisis, said Robert G. Valletta, senior vice president and associate director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""It's exactly the kind of bridge that we need to make sure people are able to maintain some level of household stability and come out of this without complete devastation,"" he said.   Getting money immediately into the hands of people who need it not only helps households buy groceries and pay rent during an acute crisis but also aids in the economy's recovery. ""That helps to keep establishments open and running,"" said Cathy Barrera, founding economist of the Prysm Group, and that could help prevent a short, sharp shock from turning into a prolonged slump after the epidemic ebbs. The government's relief package — which includes low-interest loans and grants for businesses, ready cash for individuals and expanded unemployment insurance — was enacted with that goal in mind. Individuals should soon start receiving $US1200 emergency assistance checks. But Barrera worries that the expanded unemployment benefits won't come through rapidly enough. ""I am concerned that the way this relief has been channelled through the existing unemployment insurance system — which can be difficult to access in an expedient way — can be causing us some problems,"" she said. Several states, including Connecticut, have warned that cheques could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others, like Florida, start benefits only when a claim is filed, regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for example, allows workers who don't normally qualify — like independent contractors, part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others, Kandy Thomas, a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City, found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that ""these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the US Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs."" ""There's nothing for someone like me,"" Thomas said. ""As soon as you say you're self-employed, you're done."" Normally, most states offer roughly half of a worker's previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $US215, and just 9 per cent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $US550, and 57 per cent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $US600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks. Workers in the country illegally and those newly entering the labor force remain ineligible. The New York Times Copyright © 2020"," Patricia Cohen , Tiffany Hsu ","April 10, 2020"

Several states, including Connecticut, have warned that cheques could be delayed up to five weeks because of the deluge. Others, like Florida, start benefits only when a claim is filed, regardless of the difficulties that applicants have had. The new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for example, allows workers who don't normally qualify — like independent contractors, part-timers and recent hires — to receive weekly benefits. But like many others, Kandy Thomas, a self-employed dog trainer and animal caregiver in Salt Lake City, found barriers to collecting. The state website she checked said that ""these benefits are not yet available as we are awaiting further guidance from the US Department of Labor on the process for implementing these programs."" ""There's nothing for someone like me,"" Thomas said. ""As soon as you say you're self-employed, you're done."" Normally, most states offer roughly half of a worker's previous wage for up to 26 weeks of unemployment, but the benefits can vary widely among states. At the end of 2019, the average weekly benefit in Mississippi was $US215, and just 9 per cent of unemployed workers there were eligible to receive any payments, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. In Massachusetts, the average weekly benefit was $US550, and 57 per cent of jobless workers qualified. In Florida and North Carolina, benefits last for only 12 weeks. Under the new federal law, jobless workers will get an additional $US600 each week through July. They will also be able to receive benefits for an additional 13 weeks. Workers in the country illegally and those newly entering the labor force remain ineligible. The New York Times Copyright © 2020"," Patricia Cohen , Tiffany Hsu ","April 10, 2020"

""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Thursday in remarks previewing next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. ""Global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels, but how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict"": IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva,Credit:Bloomberg She said that the IMF will release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that will show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak has turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn. Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting that 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis. Now the expectation is that over 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this yea. Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia are at high risk, she said. ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession. As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries have totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the last two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices. Georgieva said there was no question that 2020 will be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic fades in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF is forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said. ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic."" She said that she and World Bank President David Malpass will pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they can use for critical health needs. She also said that the IMF is prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that need help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board has agreed to double the loan levels it will provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide around $100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

27,/business/the-economy/power-chief-pushes-home-battery-stimulus-to-aid-virus-recovery-20200409-p54ikh.html,Power chief pushes home battery stimulus to aid virus recovery,"The head of Australia's largest power provider, AGL, has recommended making installations of household batteries and smart meters a key plank of the federal government's post-lockdown stimulus response. AGL chief executive Brett Redman said the company has raised the proposed subsidy package in talks with the Morrison government about areas that could be considered for stimulus funds to ""get the economy moving"" in the immediate post-lockdown phase. AGL's Brett Redman says batteries and smart meters should be considered for coronavirus stimulus funding.Credit:Justin McManus ""The government is doing the right thing by pushing enormous amounts of stimulus through to make sure people can stay engaged with their workforces,"" Mr Redman said. ""At the right time, government and business will need to turn their attention to defining and then implementing our plans for generating jobs across all sectors and getting the economy back onto a growth path."" Mr Redman told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald the proposal could provide desperately needed assistance to struggling electrical contractors as well as power bill relief for consumers. He added that home battery systems, which store energy from solar panels, and digital meters for consumers to monitor their energy use were being rapidly adopted by households across the market and should be considered for targeted subsidies. ""Why not accelerate that as ways of creating immediate work out there in the workforce?"" Installations of household batteries across Australia are on the rise, with more than 22,000 new systems last year. The battery market is heavily reliant on a mix of state and federal government subsidies. AGL does not immediately profit from installations but could benefit in the long term by acquiring new customer accounts. Mr Redman said electrical contractors that performed battery installations would be hard-hit during the economic downturn inflicted by the pandemic and stimulus could help them stay afloat. ""It's in everyone's interests that they survive, and survive in good shape, for when the economy recovers,"" Mr Redman said. Increasing uptake of the technology would also have wider benefits, he said, ""first for the grid but also for households by helping reduce their energy costs"". Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the government's priorities were ensuring energy reliability amid the pandemic and providing relief to distressed households through expanded hardship provisions. ""I welcome the commitment from the energy sector so far, but we must be resolute in our focus and that must be helping those in most need right now,"" he said. Electrical contractors said a government-backed program to support battery storage installations would support the economy, help smaller companies keep staff in jobs and reduce people's energy bills. ""And in the current crisis, this is critical,"" said Suresh Manickam of the National Electrical and Communications Association, a trade group representing 5400 contractors. However, Mr Manickam stressed it was important that any such scheme was only accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises that had been adversely affected by the economic downturn. Kane Thornton of the Clean Energy Council, which represents renewable energy companies, backed the calls for a stimulus package targeting clean energy technology. ""We've all been very focused on the coronavirus, but those issues around power price sensitivity and climate change haven't gone away,"" he said. ""We think this is a great opportunity for government to drive stimulus while at the same time really allow Australia to respond and prepare for a future where we need to transition out of fossil fuels and onto renewables.""

28,/business/banking-and-finance/bank-dividend-cuts-were-inevitable-with-or-without-apra-s-direction-20200409-p54ik8.html,"Bank dividend cuts were inevitable, with or without APRA's direction","The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. The major banks showed last year they were prepared to tailor their dividend payouts to their circumstances. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. While the banks may have had no other realistic choice but to support their customers if they wanted to emerge from this episode with customers, the effect of their actions is to put a significant hole of uncertain dimensions in their earnings and capital bases as they effectively subsidise large swathes of those customers, knowing that many of those subsidies will end up as bad debts. And the challenges to bank profitability don’t only flow from the actions the lenders have taken to provide life support for their customers, and the economy. The Reserve Bank’s actions in cutting the cash rate to 25 basis points and targeting a three-year bond rate at that same level by buying bonds will further squeeze net interest margins that were already under pressure. Last year, for perhaps the first time ever, the big four banks had an average net interest margin below 2 per cent. It’s going to be even lower now, even though the RBA has created a $90 billion-plus funding facility at 25 basis points to help them provide funding to small and medium-sized businesses. The major banks showed last year that they were prepared to tailor their dividends to the circumstances. NAB and Westpac cut their dividends and ANZ lowered its franking level. There’s no reason to believe that, had APRA not provided its directive, they would have left their dividends levels intact. While reducing their shareholder payouts will shore up the banks' capital levels – and a system already arguably the strongest in the world – it will come with some unfortunate consequences for the army of self-funded retirees who rely on franked dividends, particularly major bank dividends, for their income. The banks will have choices in responding to APRA, and will be conscious of that reliance their retail investors have on dividends to fund their living expenses. They could pay reduced dividends or they could pay out nothing at all until their situations become clearer. They could defer their interim dividends (except for the Commonwealth Bank which, with a June balance date, has already paid its interim dividend) and pay increased annual dividends or even a special dividend once the dust settles. They could maintain their dividends but have them underwritten, effectively issuing matching equity and therefore maintaining their capital bases. With an average share price fall of about 40 per cent since the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic became evident in late February, the banks would be reluctant to contemplate capital raisings. So retaining their earnings is the easiest, most efficient and least dilutive form of capital generation. Big capital raisings like those the banks made during the global financial crisis would be the option of last resort, one that would be made more difficult, or at last more expensive and dilutive, if the banks do cut or defer their dividends. Australia's banks entered this pandemic-induced financial crisis operating in one of the strongest banking systems in the world. Thanks to APRA’s decisive implementation of the recommendations of the Murray inquiry into the financial system, they are as well-capitalised and hold as much liquidity as any system. They have relatively low-risk balance sheets because of their big bias towards lending for housing , which is even more the case now that most of them (NAB being the exception) have shed their wealth management businesses. In the post-GFC era, they have also dramatically reduced their exposure to short-term wholesale funding markets, which means the decisions of credit ratings agencies are of less consequence than they might have been in the past. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. This week Fitch downgraded the major banks, and S&P lowered its outlook for them but that should have only a marginal impact on their funding costs. S&P has also, not surprisingly, lowered the outlook for Australia’s credit rating, which would flow through to the banks’ ratings given that governments’ ability to support their banks is a factor in the banks’ own ratings. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. In advising the big banks to defer or reduce their dividends, APRA was effectively following the lead of Europe, the UK and New Zealand, all of whom have told their banks to suspend dividend payments. The European banks have less capital and have been far less profitable than their Australian counterparts, and the impact of the coronavirus is, up to now, far more profound and damaging to the populations and economies in Europe and the UK than it is here. The Morrison government also had a starting point of one of the more conservative fiscal positions of any developed world economy, enabling it to effectively throw the kitchen sink at the economy.

However,  he cautioned that some businesses, such as pubs,  may find it more difficult to recover from the economic slump and a longer period of restrictions would only make things tougher. BOQ chief executive says maintaining social distancing policies until there is a vaccine would be ""a long time for businesses to be in hibernation."" Credit:Peter Braig   “I think the longer we leave it the more difficult it gets, not just for business customers but also just for the sanity of our personal customers,” Mr Frazis told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “My sense is that we do need to get to a position where we think through thoughtfully, when do we start releasing some of the constraints, and when do we start enabling more businesses to get to some form of normality in terms of their operations?” “For us to come out of this quicker in a safe and healthy way, we just need to be doing even more testing,"" he said. ""That is a long time for businesses to be in hibernation, and I would say that if you go down that path, really you are talking about more businesses not making it through,"" he said. Mr Frazis' comments came as BoQ became the first local bank to defer making a decision on its first-half dividend, after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) intervened on Tuesday, urging banks to conserve capital to support the economy. The bank on Wednesday also posted a 10 per cent fall in cash profit, to $151 million, for the six months ended February 29. Statutory profit for the period slumped 40 per cent, to $93 million, on restructuring charges and changes to intangible assets. The regional lender is heavily exposed to small and medium enterprises, and Mr Frazis said it would be important these businesses think about how firms might be repositioned after crisis. A large proportion of these customers are health businesses, including dentists, which have been forced to effectively stop operating. Mr Frazis said dentists were an example of businesses that would bounce back strongly, but he said other clients could face a more challenging recovery. In retail banking,  BoQ has received about 5,000 requests for assistance from customers and Mr Frazis warned of a slowdown in the housing sector due to conservatism from buyers, a lack of international buyers and a ban on open house inspections. ""You would have to say in the short term, until there's clarity around how quickly we come out of this, there will be a likely sharp drop in house prices and a drop in sales,"" he said. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the regulatory guidance on dividends had given BoQ an opportunity to ""rebase"" dividend expectations in the market, and build up more capital. ""BoQ is clearly a work in progress at this stage and the interim dividend deferral suggests things will get worse before they get better,"" Mr Lim said.

Mr Frazis said dentists were an example of businesses that would bounce back strongly, but he said other clients could face a more challenging recovery. In retail banking,  BoQ has received about 5,000 requests for assistance from customers and Mr Frazis warned of a slowdown in the housing sector due to conservatism from buyers, a lack of international buyers and a ban on open house inspections. ""You would have to say in the short term, until there's clarity around how quickly we come out of this, there will be a likely sharp drop in house prices and a drop in sales,"" he said. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the regulatory guidance on dividends had given BoQ an opportunity to ""rebase"" dividend expectations in the market, and build up more capital. ""BoQ is clearly a work in progress at this stage and the interim dividend deferral suggests things will get worse before they get better,"" Mr Lim said. BoQ shares ended the session on Wednesday 2.1 per cent weaker at $5.03. Clancy Yeates is a business reporter. Copyright © 2020", Clancy Yeates ,"April 8, 2020"
34,/business/banking-and-finance/the-coronavirus-will-accelerate-the-trend-towards-a-cashless-society-20200408-p54i6u.html,The coronavirus will accelerate the trend towards a cashless society,"The world after the coronavirus will probably be far more digitised, and payment systems appear as likely to be impacted by this as any other aspect of daily life. The use of cash has been falling around the world. In Australia, less than 30 per cent of payments are in cash these days, whereas a decade and a half ago more than 70 per cent of transactions were in cash. In Sweden, the use of cash for payments is so low – about 10 per cent of payments -- it is a near-cashless society. The pandemic and the fear of infection from bank notes are accelerating the trend away from cash towards digital payments. Amid fears of getting the coronavirus, many businesses have stopped accepting cash from customers.Credit:AAP The Bank for International Settlements, in a paper released late last week, said the outbreak had led to unprecedented public concerns about viral transmission via cash, with central banks reporting a large increase in media inquiries about the safety of using cash and internet searches for the combination of ""cash"" and ""virus"" soaring. The intensity of recent searches for those two words, according to graphics in the BIS paper, is most acute in Australia and France. Around the world, countries are sterilising their bank notes even though there are, as yet, no known cases of transmission via cash. The virus appears, however, to survive longer on non-porous materials like plastic and steel, which probably explains consumers’ anxiety. Historically, in times of crisis, consumers hoarded cash. This time, however, appears to be different and the pandemic could accelerate the trend away from cash and towards digital transactions. It is already generating increased interest in digital currencies, with China said to be close to releasing a digital version of its currency. In recent years most central banks have started researching the potential for digital currencies, with their efforts intensifying after Facebook attempted to launch its own global digital currency, Libra. The Libra rollout stalled after some of its core backers pulled out in the face of strong central bank and legislators’ opposition to the notion of a privately-owned digital currency, and it appears Facebook might try to alter its strategy towards the use of Libra’s infrastructure as a platform for third parties’ digital payment ambitions. Facebook was pursuing a ""stable coin"" strategy, with Libra’s value established by a basket of physical currencies whose value would match that of the value of the stable coins in circulation. That is quite different – and was far more of a threat to central banks and their influence over their financial systems -- than a conventional cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, whose value is very unstable and therefore makes it a poor medium of exchange. There’s the risk of a generational divide if central banks move too quickly on the digital front, given that the profile of those most reliant on cash transactions tilts heavily towards older people. Libra’s launch galvanised the central banks’ interest in their own digital currencies, as well as their efforts in thwarting Facebook’s ambitions. Central banks including the Reserve Bank have been researching and trialling elements of digital currency platforms. The RBA has run simulations of a wholesale system, for instance, for interbank settlements. Most of the central banks are wary about rushing towards a digital currency future because of the potential disruptions it might cause to their existing banking systems if people were given a choice of holding digital currency issued directly by a central bank rather depositing funds with privately-owned commercial banks. In financial markets like Australia’s or Canada’s, where the banking systems operated soundly through the global financial crisis, have sophisticated digital payment systems and now, after significant strengthening of their capital bases and liquidity, are supporting their economies through the pandemic, there’s no urgency to fundamentally change the structure of – to disintermediate -- their financial systems. There’s also the risk of a generational divide if central banks move too quickly on the digital front, given that the profile of those most reliant on cash transactions tilts heavily towards older people. Nevertheless, the seemingly inexorable trend towards digitisation of payment systems, combined with the likelihood that other countries like Sweden and China will move early and the potential for the big tech companies like Facebook, Google or Amazon to create their own currencies and payment systems outside traditional banking systems, means the central banks have no option but to continue to explore the potential of digital currencies. That exploration will have a sharper edge if China digitises its currency. Only this week, China recommitted itself to the introduction of a digital yuan. It sees a digitised currency as a way of increasing its global influence and reducing the dominance of the US dollar in global commerce and finance, a dominance that enables the US to exert geopolitical influence through the global financial system. China has some unlikely allies, with no little thanks to Donald Trump’s diminishing of America’s role in key international institutions, his ""America First"" agenda and his willingness to use tariffs and sanctions against America’s foes. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, shocked many last year when he advocated development of a ""multi-polar"" digital currency to displace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, arguing that there was growing asymmetry between the dominance of the dollar in the global financial system and the diminished US share of global economic activity. The US accounts for only about 10 per cent of world trade and 15 per cent of global GDP but two thirds of all countries peg their currency to the US dollar, and more than half of global trade is invoiced in US dollars. Global financial market activity is dominated by the greenback. As the US withdraws from global economic leadership, a ""synthetic hegemonic currency"" would dampen the domineering influence of the US dollar on global trade and the impact of domestic developments in the US economy and markets wouldn’t spill over to the same degree into other economies and markets, Carney said. He didn’t say – but China would be aware – that a reduced role for the US dollar would also have a negative impact on the US economy and living standards. Its status as the world’s reserve economy allows Americans to live well beyond their means, lowering the cost of imports and Americans’ cost of borrowing. Thus there are geopolitical dimensions to the push towards digital currencies that coincide with the sharper edge that the pandemic has given central banks' interest in facilitating digital payments and investigating digital currencies.

Banks have in recent weeks said small businesses and households can defer their loan repayments for up to six months if needed, but Fitch predicted this would not stop some loans from going into default.

""As a result, asset-quality metrics will likely weaken from current levels over the next 12-18 months,"" Fitch said. The plunge in official interest rates was another risk identified by Fitch. Falling rates crunch banks' net interest margins, which refer to the difference between banks' funding costs and what they charge for loans. ""Earnings will face pressure from both higher impairment charges and lower interest rates. The central banks in Australia and New Zealand have cut their respective cash rates to 0.25 per cent and indicated that they will remain there for a prolonged period,"" Fitch said.

40,/business/small-business/why-employers-resent-entrepreneurial-staff-20200409-p54ihg.html,Why employers resent entrepreneurial staff,"One of the implications of the coronavirus crisis is that many employees, on experiencing the sudden impact of employment instability and the risk of financial hardship, begin dreaming of a future where they are less reliant on the viability of an employer. A future where they themselves are the employer and not just another worker beholden to one. And not only dreaming of such a possibility but actively embarking on it. So as they undergo cuts to wages and reduced hours, as they deal with restricted duties and modified job responsibilities, they start to work on their startup ambitions despite still being employed. Working from home may awaken some to entrepreneurship. Credit:Shutterstock.  Complicating the situation is they’re still employed not just by any firm but by a potential competitor since the business they’re launching is directly related to their current place of work. It’s known as an ""employee spin-off"" and isn’t limited to times of crisis but to any occasion an employee is pursuing an entrepreneurial endeavour while deriving income from the organisation they’ll soon be competing against. So you can see why employers regard such employees as ""mafia"" and ""parasites"", both of which are terms found in a fresh study published in the Small Business Economics journal. The researchers explored a type of behaviour known as ""parental hostility"", which is when parent companies form an unfavourable view of employees who build their own little enterprise in what many consider to be a conflict of interest. The study, in an attempt to understand the specific causes of this resentment, analysed almost 1100 spin-offs. The results reveal three predominant causes. Replay   The first cause is when the products and services sold by the employee’s spin-off are similar to those sold by the employer, thereby converting the employee into ""a predator stealing its parent’s ideas and innovations"" – an insider deteriorating their employer’s competitive advantage. The second is when the employee poaches their colleagues since they, too, can capitalise on their insider status to accelerate the commercialisation of the spin-off’s products and services.

41,/business/small-business/why-employers-resent-entrepreneurial-staff-20200409-p54ihg.html,Why employers resent entrepreneurial staff,"One of the implications of the coronavirus crisis is that many employees, on experiencing the sudden impact of employment instability and the risk of financial hardship, begin dreaming of a future where they are less reliant on the viability of an employer. A future where they themselves are the employer and not just another worker beholden to one. And not only dreaming of such a possibility but actively embarking on it. So as they undergo cuts to wages and reduced hours, as they deal with restricted duties and modified job responsibilities, they start to work on their startup ambitions despite still being employed. Working from home may awaken some to entrepreneurship. Credit:Shutterstock.  Complicating the situation is they’re still employed not just by any firm but by a potential competitor since the business they’re launching is directly related to their current place of work. It’s known as an ""employee spin-off"" and isn’t limited to times of crisis but to any occasion an employee is pursuing an entrepreneurial endeavour while deriving income from the organisation they’ll soon be competing against. So you can see why employers regard such employees as ""mafia"" and ""parasites"", both of which are terms found in a fresh study published in the Small Business Economics journal. The researchers explored a type of behaviour known as ""parental hostility"", which is when parent companies form an unfavourable view of employees who build their own little enterprise in what many consider to be a conflict of interest. The study, in an attempt to understand the specific causes of this resentment, analysed almost 1100 spin-offs. The results reveal three predominant causes. Replay   The first cause is when the products and services sold by the employee’s spin-off are similar to those sold by the employer, thereby converting the employee into ""a predator stealing its parent’s ideas and innovations"" – an insider deteriorating their employer’s competitive advantage. The second is when the employee poaches their colleagues since they, too, can capitalise on their insider status to accelerate the commercialisation of the spin-off’s products and services. The outcome is a further deterioration in the parent company’s competitive advantage. The third is when the employee’s idea isn’t new because the employee had previously pitched it to their employer as an intrapreneurial innovation only to have been rejected. The subsequent hostility arises because the ""employee’s efforts to implement the idea may act as an awakening signal"", triggering the employer to react irrespective of the reason they blocked it in the first place. Confronted by those three factors, threatened employers often retaliate in a number of ways. Some impose non-compete clauses.

""I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming,"" he said. ""Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to put it back in again."" On Thursday, Mesoblast told the Australian stock exchange it had secured an agreement with the US National Institute of Health to test its stem cell treatment on coronavirus patients and establish whether it will reduce the mortality of patients with severe respiratory illness caused by the virus. The company's Remestemcel-L product will be evaluated in a trial of 240 patients with COVID-19 to test its effectiveness in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can occur after the body's immune system has an excessive response to the virus, called a cytokine storm, which in turn results in damage to lung tissue. The mortality rate of those with acute respiratory distress syndrome because of coronavirus is as high as 80 per cent. Remestemcel-L has been developed for other inflammatory conditions and was successful in a Phase-3 trial in children to treat a condition called acute graft-versus-host disease,  a condition in which the body's immune cells attack healthy cells after a bone marrow transplant. The thinking is that those with acute respiratory distress syndrome have similarities in terms of the inflammation response seen in those with acute graft-versus-host disease. Dr Itescu said the company will evaluate whether the treatment will reduce coronavirus mortality rates within a 28-day period. It will take around three months to recruit patients for the trial but there should be some indications of the treatment's effectiveness as early as July, he said. ""It will then be to sit down with the FDA and talk about whether the data is strong enough. [If it is], what we need to plan for is how to scale up manufacturing."" The Mesoblast share price, which had already rocketed higheron news it was turning its focus to the coronavirus crisis, surged another 36 per cent to $2.50 on Thursday.

The original measure, ""cash flow assistance for businesses"" announced on March 12 and then updated on March 22, in most cases did not result in cash received. The second measure announced on March 30 applies to all businesses and will result in cash being received. Scott Morrison's government has unveiled a number of small business support measures over the past three weeks but eligibility varies. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen To be eligible for cash flow assistance businesses must have an annual turnover of less than $50 million and have employees. The credits are only available to active eligible employers that had been established prior to March 12, 2020. How small businesses that commenced operating during the March 2020 quarter, that had not registered as a group employer by March 12, will be affected is unknown. For eligible small businesses the cash flow assistance is as a credit on their March BAS equal to 100 per cent of their total PAYG withholding tax deducted from employees’ wages, up to a maximum of $50,000 with a minimum credit of $10,000. Most small businesses are unlikely to receive a payment as a result of this relief measure, unless a business has a total for PAYG withholding and net GST for the March quarter that is less than $10,000 credit. For example, a business with two employees that deducted $5000 in PAYG withholding for the March quarter, and has a net GST payable amount after taking into account input tax credits of $4000, should receive a $1000 refund. No application needs to be made to receive the cash flow benefit, but businesses must lodge their March quarter BAS. The cash flow assistance for eligible businesses will also apply to the June quarter BAS, which must be lodged by July 28, 2020. Replay   The original measure did not provide any benefits for small businesses that did not have employees, such as sole traders and partnerships. The only assistance available to these small business owners was allowing them to apply for the job seeker support with Centrelink, which came with the extra Coronavirus supplement of $550 a fortnight. The second measure, the ""JobKeeper payment"", will result in businesses receiving a cash payment of $1500 per eligible employee from March 30, 2020 for a maximum period of six months. Eligible small businesses will be those: The period used to assess whether there has been a decrease of more than 30 per cent must be at least a month, but it could also be for periods of three months, six months, or nine months. This means if a business has 30 per cent less income for the current period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the month, quarter, half year, or nine months ending March 2019, they should be eligible for the payment. Eligible employees are those employed by a business that has met the reduction in turnover requirement, and: The application process for eligible businesses with employees requires them to register their interest in receiving the JobKeeper payment on the Australian tax offices website. As the legislation to give effect to this job keeper payment has not yet been passed there is some uncertainty with regard to how it will work. For example, where a business wants to keep its employees on the payroll while they are not working, but only paying them the JobKeeper payment, would they be in breach of industrial awards or Fair Work Commission rules. Businesses without employees will thankfully also benefit from the JobKeeper payment. However, the amount of JobKeeper payment that they receive will be limited to one person per business. This means a partnership or other business entities, such as companies and trusts, operating a business without employees can only get the payment for one person. Small businesses that receive the JobKeeper payment, if they want to continue receiving the payment, will need to provide information to the ATO on a monthly basis. Exactly what this information will be is not known, but it will include the number of eligible employees employed by the business.

But from that boredom one savvy operator in the historic gold mining town came up with ‘Boober Eats’, a risqué take on the classic food delivery business model using skimpies. 'Boober Eats' is a new take on the popular food delivery service. Nat Poole, Boober Eats brainchild and owner of Kalgoorlie-based skimpy agency La Femme Fatale, came up with the service after racking her brain for ideas to keep her workers in a job. “It literally just started off as a joke sitting in the lounge room with one of my skimpies,” she said. “I put a post up still rolling on as a joke, but people started contacting me. It was insane and it started the next day.” Users order food online, which is picked up by a Boober Eats skimpy and driver and delivered to the customer’s door. The cost of delivery is about six times the normal online food delivery charge. Ms Poole said the idea had proven so popular it had grown from one driver and skimpy on the first night to four teams, and she was recruiting to expand across Australia. “We got 10 calls on the first night and yesterday the phone started ringing at 3pm,” she said. “I’m getting a lot of calls for it across Australia. For the rest of this week, I will focus on Kal then start sending out girls in the rest of Australia.” Social distancing measures escalated rapidly in March, tightening from bans of gatherings of 500 or more to just two people outside of homes. These measures hit the hospitality and accommodation sector hardest, with more than 90 per cent across the country reporting impacts to their operations and a reduction in demand, according to an ABS survey of businesses released Tuesday. 'Boober Eats’ is a risqué take on the food delivery business model using Kalgoorlie's skimpies. The survey revealed 78 per cent of businesses in the sector had made changes to its workforce including temporarily reducing hours (70 per cent), placing staff on unpaid leave (43 per cent) and placing staff on paid leave (29 per cent). Ms Poole said Boober Eats would keep money coming through the door for her skimpies. “It is definitely really important, we all need to survive,” she said. “I hated seeing all my girls go from working five days a week and making really good money to nothing.” While the workers were scantily clad, Ms Poole said they regularly used sanitiser and wore gloves and face masks: “1.5 [metres], stay alive, that’s what I tell the girls.” Hamish Hastie is WAtoday's business reporter.

Coles said the more flexible trading hours were welcome, even though it has reduced its trading hours to allow staff to clean and restock. “Last week Coles reduced trading hours nationally to give our team members the time and space to extensively clean our stores and replenish the shelves for customers the next day. In particular this ensures cleanliness for our elderly and vulnerable customers attending our Community Hour in the first hour of trade.

Replay   I worry that it's sending a bad message to my young son and daughter and I'd really prefer not to, but sometimes I feel it's the only way to get work done. This is an excellent question and one that I think a lot more parents are suddenly asking due to COVID-19 and the need to work from home. Work TherapyCredit:John Shakespeare  As someone who's worked from home for the last five years, I've always fretted about shutting myself off, and have considered it a bit of a last resort. I've felt that unless I'm battling the most demanding deadline or on the most critical phone-call, an interruption from someone with a startling amount of jam on their face and wearing nothing but a tutu ranges anywhere from acceptable to thoroughly welcome. You sound like you share my worry that closing the door indicates to your young children ""I don't want to see you at all"". I asked organisational and counselling psychologist Jasmine Sliger whether you, I (and presumably many others) are right to be anxious about putting up such an obvious barrier. ""If your children are less than speaking age, leave the door open as they can't communicate needs yet. If they're five to nine, I think it's important to model the fact that mums and dads need to work to make money to pay for the house, food, car, fun things, and so on."" Jasmine says that children in this age bracket are old enough to understand what you're telling them and will learn to entertain themselves. You might even describe their activities - colouring, playing with toys, building a fort with blankets - as 'going to work'. Above all, though, it's essential that you communicate with your children, and tell them exactly what's happening and why. ""It's important that they know the reason that you are shutting the door is so you can concentrate and block out any noise. ""I can feel the guilt in your tone. Closing the door is not the cruellest thing. It teaches your children boundaries.""

57,/business/workplace/what-will-tomorrow-s-workplace-bring-more-elbow-room-for-starters-20200408-p54i85.html,"What will tomorrow’s workplace bring? More elbow room, for starters","Many workers are weeks, if not months, from returning to their offices and regaining a semblance of a normal workday. Given the recent layoff and furlough announcements, many are wondering whether they will even have a job after the dust settles. But building owners and company leaders — and those who help them manage properties and design workplaces — have begun to anticipate the time when the stay-at-home orders are lifted and people start heading back to the office. Those in the midst of planning suggest that the post-pandemic office might look radically different. Returning workers can expect stepped-up cleaning and a reinforcement of social distancing. Hand sanitiser stands will probably be positioned in lobbies. Maintenance staff will swab door handles. There may be limits on the number of people allowed in a lift. Offices will have to be reconfigured for life after the pandemic.Credit:Rohan Thomson Workplaces may have significant changes in the long run, including new seating arrangements and the addition of building materials that discourage the spread of germs. New technology could provide access to rooms and elevators without employees having to touch a handle or press a button. Even if such changes won't greet most employees at first, their return to the office may be carefully choreographed. In the short term, signs may be posted reminding everyone to wash hands — and perhaps stick with elbow bumps rather than handshakes and hugs. Disinfectant wipes will be everywhere. Some companies are considering phasing in employees to limit the number of people on the premises and ease them back to office life after a prolonged period of sequestering at home. ""You're trying to build confidence and a secure feeling,"" said Matthew Barlow, a vice chairman of Savills, a real estate company. Remote-work practices that many companies have adopted in recent weeks are likely to continue in some form for the foreseeable future, leaving some offices lightly populated and making it easier for workers to spread out. Alternating groups of employees at the office is also under discussion. ""There could be A teams and B teams working different days,"" said Scott Rechler, chief executive and chairman of RXR Realty. Moving desks farther apart could also give workers more elbow room. The whole point of kinetic furniture was to bring people together. Now it has a different function: to pull people apart. Over the past decade, many companies eliminated private offices in favour of open plans, but the amount of space per office worker declined 25 per cent, said Janet Pogue McLaurin, an architect and principal at the design firm Gensler, which has been tracking changes in the workplace in annual surveys since 2008. The typical workstation of a decade ago — the cubicle — was 2.40 by 2.40 metres. By 2015, the workstation was down to 1.80 by 2.40 metres, and in recent years, the contraction has continued. Benching — desks lined up side by side — has been another way workers have been squeezed. A benching desk with a width of 1.80 metres would be consistent with current social distancing guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many desks are not that wide. And often one row of desks faces another row, so that employees are directly opposite their peers. To create a 1.80-metre radius around each employee, companies may have to pull desks apart or stagger employees so they are not facing one another, experts say. Companies are considering other ways to give employees breathing room. A conference room intended for 12 might be repurposed as a meeting room for six. In lounge areas, chairs could be placed farther apart. Chairs on casters will permit people to roll seats a safe distance from colleagues. ""The whole point of kinetic furniture was to bring people together,"" said Kelly Griffin, a principal at NBBJ who leads the architecture firm's workplace strategy group. ""Now it has a different function: to pull people apart."" Ten per cent of US office workers no longer have assigned seats, according to Gensler. This so-called hot-desking, or hotelling — where employees do not have designated desks but instead come in and find a place to sit — may go on hiatus, if only until the fear of contagion fades. ""Maybe we don't move around quite as much,"" McLaurin said. Or gather in large groups. All-hands meetings may not resume immediately, said Michael Kleinberg, president and partner of MKDA, an interior design firm. ""Nobody is going to want to come,"" he added. ""I think there's going to be a continuation of Zoom meetings for a while."" However, the pandemic may result in fundamental changes that will be around for years to come, altering how office buildings are designed. Just as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks created tighter security measures in office buildings and flooding from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompted the elevation of mechanical systems, the coronavirus may focus attention on air circulation and filtering. Sensor-activated controls may also increase, reducing the number of surfaces that need to be touched in an office and allowing workers to use lifts and open doors with the wave of a hand. Certain materials may come to the fore. Smooth surfaces that are easy to wipe will be preferable to textured or porous ones that could harbour germs. And antimicrobial materials used in hospitals and laboratories may migrate to offices. Interest has surged in new materials such as those that mimic sharkskin, to which microscopic organisms have difficulty adhering. Some old metals may experience a revival. Copper and its alloys — including brass and bronze — have been shown to be essentially self-sanitising, able to kill bacteria and, early studies suggest, perhaps even the coronavirus plaguing the planet. The ability to work from home at least a few days a week — long sought by many workers — may be here to stay. Even firms that previously insisted on everyone's being in the office — either from force of habit or a suspicion that employees would loaf if not under management's watchful eye — have discovered that the work-from-home experiment that the crisis has thrust on large swathes of the workforce has turned out better than expected. ""A big light bulb went off during this pandemic,"" said Anita Kamouri, vice president at Iometrics, a workplace services firm. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, expects more than 25 per cent of employees to continue working from home multiple days a week, up from less than 4 per cent who did so before the pandemic. ""I don't think that genie is going back into the bottle,"" she said. Already preliminary findings from a new study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggest that more than 34 per cent of respondents have switched from commuting to working at home across the United States. In the Northeast, more than 40 per cent have made the switch. The digital infrastructure for remote work already existed, said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of the study. ""The tools people found are working pretty well,"" he said. If companies do allow more of their employees to log in from home, some may consider reducing their office footprint, which could have significant ramifications for commercial real estate. But if the amount of space devoted to employee workstations and other functions increases, demand for space could balance out. Lounges, cafes and other gathering spaces that sprang up to make collaborative work easier may become even more important if employees do more work from home and commute in for meetings. At the Seattle office of B+H Architects, an informal space called the Sandbox was designed as ""a place to meet and exchange ideas,"" said Doug Demers, a managing principal at the firm. The circular room has a large digital screen for sharing information and curved seating that provides a sense of enclosure. People working from home could call in remotely, Demers said, but he thinks this kind of space will be one of the things that draw employees back to the office because it helps provide a sense of community. ""There will be a higher value around spaces where we come together,"" he said. The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Jane Margolies ,"April 8, 2020"

CEO of Scentre, Peter Allen, at Westfield Shopping Centre, SydneCredit: Louise Kennerley ""It would help to get rid of this confusion, when you look at the categories that the government has said must close, such as gyms, nail bars and cinemas ... that's only 14 per cent of our tenants so potentially a lot of other stores could open,"" Mr Allen said. ""Government is confusing in its messaging ... they say there are restrictions in moving around, yet the PM says jobs are essential. But the one clear message from the PM is that retailers must honour their leases."" Mr Allen said shopping centres were deemed ""public transient places"" and ""essential activities"" because they included supermarkets, grocery stores, food markets, retail stores and medical centres. Government is confusing in its messaging ... they say there are restrictions in moving around, yet the PM says jobs are essential. ""Some of our retailers have been required to close to meet government requirements and unfortunately, some have voluntarily decided to close,"" Mr Allen said on a call after the group's annual general meeting. ""If you are a retailer and know you can get staffing costs paid through JobKeeper ... and we are working with SME [small and medium enterprises] and bigger retailers ... it makes sense to me to open to keep staff employed and these businesses have the support of the banks. ""Money is a merry-go-round and retail is such a big part of the GDP."" On Tuesday, the federal government introduced mandatory regulations for landlords to give rent relief for businesses with less than $50 million in turnover and rent reviews for others. Mr Allen said his leasing team was talking to all 3600 tenants in its Westfield shopping centre portfolio and would assess each one on a case-by-case basis. He said he would not discuss lease agreements with dissident tenants, ""through the press"". Last month, retailer Solomon Lew, chairman of Premier Investments, which owns Smiggle and Portmans brands, said he would not pay rent during the shutdown. In his address to the annual general meeting, Mr Allen said: ""We continue to work our way through the economic shock with our retailers and their banks, in particular, our small to medium-sized retailers or ‘mum and dad’ retailers who are most vulnerable."" As a way to help tenants and keep sales ticking over, Scentre has bought forward the launch of Westfield direct, a drive-through service at the shopping centres to pick up goods bought online. At the AGM, the remuneration report received a 23 per cent vote against, although it is a non-binding resolution, while the vote to give performance rights to Mr Allen received a 21 per cent vote against, which is a binding resolution. Scentre securities are up 7.7 per cent to $1.88. Carolyn Cummins is Commercial Property Editor for The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", Carolyn Cummins ,"April 8, 2020"

The 211 Northumberland Street property is a 7654-square-metre building, home to Centrelink, and was sold at a passing initial yield of 6.59 per cent on behalf of vendor ESR. The four-level building has a four-star NABERS rating and a weighed average lease expiry of 3.04 years, with easy access to the Hume Highway. An office at 211 Northumberland Street in the Liverpool CBD has sold for $52.5m. John McCann, James Barber and Frank Oliveri of Colliers and Peter Vines and Victor Sheu of Ray White Commercial advised on the sale. Mr McCann, national director of investment services at Colliers International, said there had been strong demand in Liverpool over the past 12 months, with the new airport in close proximity and the shortage of good-quality investment stock ""meaning 211 Northumberland Street was very well received by the market"". Another recent deal was the on-market sale was the Leichhardt Collection, a sale and lease back on behalf of Best and Less. Colliers International's James Cowan and Matthew Meynell brokered the $29 million at a passing initial yield of 4.63 per cent. Mr Meynell, head of investment services Australia, said it had become apparent that property was relatively more attractive than cash or equities and ""our recent campaigns have displayed a level of confidence in this asset class amidst the current market conditions"".

Power led Fortescue through some of its bleakest years. It faced constant scepticism from analysts and media between 2012 and 2015 as its enormous debt pile threatened to cripple the company but a determination to succeed saw it come out the other end as one of the globe's biggest players. “We quadrupled production and took the costs from uncompetitive down to the lowest-cost producer in the world,” Power says.

Workers were told on Friday morning that those working two weeks on and one week off would move to a four on, two off arrangement while workers on four and three days and eight and six days would start working two weeks on, two off. FMG workers will move to drastically different rosters over the next three months to stop the spread of coronavirus.Credit:Quentin Jones The roster changes come after growing concern over the impact the virus would have in WA's regions and remote communities and images emerge of miners not following social distancing protocols. Miners have so far been exempt from any major restrictions, including some interstate travel, but earlier this week all non-essential travel to WA's Kimberley region was banned and some shire councillors in the area have called for it to include FIFO workers. Fortescue’s chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines said Fortescue, together with the broader WA mining industry, currently had the support of governments but in order to maintain those exemptions it needed to take every precaution to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 spread. “We believe implementing a temporary change to our site operational roster will contribute to thesafety of our team, their families and the broader community, as well as help us fulfil our responsibility to provide the Fortescue family with secure employment during this uncertain time,"" she said. “We have a strong track record of doing what we say we are going to do. ""The iron ore industry and the Pilbara more broadly is the engine room of WA and Australia’s economy and it is our responsibility to make sure we have a healthy, committed workforce that allows us to continue operating during this crisis."" The company said the new rosters would reduce movement on and off Fortescue's sites by approximately 40 per cent and would be in place for an initial period of three months with the possibility to extend to six months. Goldfields gold miner Saracen also announced today it had opted for longer FIFO rosters for all its personnel to at least three weeks on, three weeks off. It has also restricted FIFO travel to charter flights only with strict health screening before departure. FMG's Pilbara rivals BHP and Rio Tinto were also reviewing rosters. On Thursday WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state government was working with miners cooperatively to make sure they were adhering to social distancing rules.

65,/business/companies/miles-underground-sleeping-at-work-how-miners-try-to-dodge-the-virus-20200327-p54ehg.html,"Miles underground, sleeping at work: How miners try to dodge the virus","There's room for about 2,500 people, a golf simulator and a three-storey cafe at BHP Group's Mulla Mulla mining camp, deep in WA's remote Pilbara region, one of the world's most important iron ore hubs. The site and dozens more like it would be a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. But sending employees to work from home isn't an option. For much of the year, it is their home; where they eat, sleep and work in close proximity for weeks at a time. It's a potentially devastating risk that the biggest resources companies are juggling the world over, from oil rigs in the North Sea to copper mines in the Chilean desert. With much of the world's raw materials extracted in remote and inhospitable locations, they're scrambling to protect the well-being of their vast residential workforces while keeping the world supplied with critical commodities. BHP's Mulla Mulla camp: Sites like this could be a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. Credit:Trevor Collens ""We are not a business that can do all of our work remotely,"" said Mike Henry, chief executive officer of BHP, the world's top miner and a company that employs about 72,000 staff or contractors, ""We are fully focused on action to reduce the risk of transmission."" BHP isn't alone. Mines in Chile to oil fields on Alaska's North Slope are limiting access, splitting crews into rotating teams and checking temperatures of employees as they step aboard helicopters or pass through access gates at sites. Isolation zones have been set up at accommodation villages, hot buffets scrapped at canteens, and extra cleaners hired. Here in Australia, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is on alert to airlift patients from far-flung operations, while at Rio Tinto Group's Kitimat aluminium smelter in Canada, emergency plans for virus cases are pinned up alongside warnings about the location of grizzly bears. Sending employees to work from home isn't an option. For much of the year, it is their home; where they eat, sleep and work in close proximity for weeks at a time. Producers are also attempting to keep pace with rapidly tightening controls on the movement of people and goods, and preparing for the potential impact of multiple positive cases. ""Everyone's got a bunch of scenarios that they're planning for,"" said Paul Everingham, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia. Some cracks are appearing, though largely because the drastic government measures around the world to contain the virus are making it unfeasible to keep operating, as opposed to the virus actually taking down the workforce. Platinum powerhouse South Africa this week said it was shutting its mines for three weeks amid a nationwide lock-down, while operations in copper giants Chile and Peru have been curtailed. A widespread shutdown of global resources production would just deepen the havoc the virus is already wreaking on the commodities industry. While demand is being devastated as swathes of the world go into lock-down, China's gradually returning to work and is going to start needing more raw materials as its factories fire up again. The challenge is particularly acute in commodity powerhouses like Australia, Russia and Canada where staff often need to be transported in and housed because production sites are so remote. A wave of interstate travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus has complicated the movement of mining companies' fly-in, fly-out workers.Credit:Louie Douvis  About 20 per cent of Australia's mining workforce of around 218,000 are fly-in staff that typically stay at sites for between one and four weeks at a time. The US oil and gas sector alone employs about 157,000 people, including on offshore rigs. Canada's oil sands industry has already had suspected cases and has taken action at camps to reduce the prospects of virus transmission. Producer Suncor Energy is taking steps including spacing employees out on buses so nobody is sitting next to anyone else. And in Russia, which churns out everything from crude to nickel in some of the most remote locations on the planet, oil producer Gazprom Neft has increased the length of shifts at its camps. Crude-pipeline operator Transneft has done the same. We have remote work sites and a relatively tight density of people. ""We have remote work sites and a relatively tight density of people,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said last week on an investor call. The producer has limited the number of workers at its assets in Alaska, freeing up bed spaces to serve as a potential quarantine, and is reviewing options at other sites, including in Norway and China. ""If necessary, we can have quarantine available in these locations,"" he said. Oil giant BP has divided workers at major operational sites into separate shifts, and is restricting contact between the two teams. Other energy producers including Royal Dutch Shell and Inpex Corp. have already had staff test positive for COVID-19 in recent days. South African utility Eskom Holdings SOC is housing power station workers in lodges away from their families. At BHP's Whaleback operation, opened in 1967 and the oldest mine in the Pilbara, yellow tape marks out social spacing distances on the floor of a cafeteria and solo workers sit at opposite ends of communal tables usually crowded with staff. Employees at other BHP sites are holding meetings in outdoor picnic areas, or using grids laid out on floors to make sure they don't stray too close when gathered indoors. A small group of tug boat operators who usually commute from Tasmania to WA -- typically a nine-hour journey on multiple flights -- have been temporarily relocated, along with their families. [Mining camps] are set up to minimise space. They're not set up for isolation because of their very nature. It's inevitable there will be some impact on output at mines as producers implement virus-protection measures, said Paul Mitchell, Sydney-based global mining and metals leader at EY, which is working with clients on handling the pandemic. ""Even if you keep running, there will be some disruption, because running at 100 per cent is going to put pressure on a workforce,"" he said. Some companies are examining options to add flexibility by housing additional workers closer to their mines in unused tourist accommodation or construction camps. BHP is seeking to hire 1,500 staff in temporary roles to help operations through the crisis. There's a recognition that busy mining camps hold risks of multiple infections once any cases arise, according to Mitchell. ""They're set up to minimise space,"" he said. ""They're not set up for isolation because of their very nature."" Even for miners who return home after their shifts, rather than living in camps, the safest place to be right now may be underground, according to Bob Timbs, a district official for the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, which represents about 20,000 mining and energy workers in Australia. Members include workers at South32's Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operation southwest of Sydney, where shift times have been staggered and less than half the usual number of miners are packing into cages that ferry them on a journey underground that can take as long as 10 minutes. ""Once they're underground and in their development teams, they might only have contact with seven or eight people during the whole day, that's a lot less than in an office environment,"" said Timbs, a third-generation coal miner. ""I've got more concerns for the guys when they are on the surface."" Bloomberg  Copyright © 2020", David Stringer ,"March 27, 2020"
