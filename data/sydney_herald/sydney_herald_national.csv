Deacon Brian Lineker after his solitary morning prayers at Victoria’s oldest Anglican Church, St Stephen's at Portland.
 The same thing will happen at 4pm in the handsome bluestone church, built in 1856. It will be, says Deacon Brian Lineker, the first time in the history of St Stephen's church and its humble antecedents in the town of Portland, south-west Victoria, that services have not been held for the public at Easter. “Until now, our services have been held every Sunday without a single break since the first week that Edward Henty stepped ashore in Portland in 1834,” said Reverend Lineker, referring to the man generally credited with being the first European settler in Victoria, though sealers and the whaler William Dutton had been there before. “The Sunday services didn’t stop for world wars or even the 1919 Spanish flu pandemic or the polio epidemic in 1937.” The current coronavirus pandemic, however, has closed the doors of every place of worship in Australia on the instructions last month of federal and state governments. Among other historic bluestone churches in Portland closed down are the graceful Catholic All Saints Church, built above the town's harbour in 1857, and Wesley Church, now a Uniting Church, built in 1865. Since the closure, either Reverend Lineker or his fellow cleric, Deacon Alan Ford, have performed lonely prayer services, morning and evening, at St Stephen’s. They admit they lack the technical ability to stream the services via the internet. The two deacons devote part of each day to phoning parishioners to ensure their needs are being met. The lack of a congregation for services, however, is causing a crisis of purpose, Reverend Lineker says. “I’m also the chaplain to the Mission to Seafarers here in Portland, but of course that’s not operating. I’m the chaplain to three nursing homes, and I’m not allowed to enter any of them, either. “So I give the morning and evening prayers alone, and I go for a run. It’s a difficult time."" The activities director at one of Portland’s larger nursing homes had told him many of the residents were distressed at the loss of a Sunday service. Portland's Catholic All Saints Church.  “A lot of the people there are in their 80s and beyond. They look forward to the Sunday service, and suddenly, it’s not there for them,” the deacon said. St Stephen’s was built in 1856 with the support of the Henty family, making it Victoria’s oldest Anglican church. However, continuous Church of England services had been held in the 24 years before that, first in the open, later in the Henty family home and at the Henty woolstore and, from 1842, in a schoolhouse that still sits next to the church. A huge olive tree, planted in 1881 from a seed taken from the Garden of Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem – where the Gospels say Jesus underwent his anguish, sweating drops of blood the night before he was arrested and crucified – sits by the church walls. And now, like all the other churches in the land, a virus has condemned the old bluestone churches of south-west Victoria to sit empty, apart from the lonely whisper of morning and evening prayers.

He said a bystander in his early 20s, who went to the aid of a woman and was struck by the vehicle during the man's attempt to flee, had been taken to hospital.

He said a bystander in his early 20s, who went to the aid of a woman and was struck by the vehicle during the man's attempt to flee, had been taken to hospital. The man then ran down the road and was seen by a lone officer who was driving towards a nearby park. After conversations with witnesses led the officer to the man, he tried to negotiate before firing a taser. ""It's my understanding that was not successful,"" Superintendent Fleming said. ""He was then threatened with the knife, where he feared for his safety, and he discharged a number of rounds from his police-issued pistol."" The man was struck in the torso and was immediately helped by officers. Paramedics were called and took him to hospital in a serious condition. The police ethical standards command, with oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission, will investigate the matter. On Monday police fatally shot a man who had set himself alight and ran at officers in a Sunnybank Hills car park. Anyone with information is urged to contact Policelink on 13 14 44 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Matt Dennien is a reporter for the Brisbane Times.

Police have handed out more than $165,000 worth of fines and dozens of court attendance orders related to public health orders aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, with about one-third of all fines issued in just four areas - Sydney City, Canterbury-Bankstown, Liverpool and Fairfield. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says he will personally check every fine issued. Credit:Kate Geraghty Health Minister Brad Hazzard also announced a new fine of $5000 and up to six months in prison for people who spit or cough on frontline workers on Thursday. The announcement comes as unions say they have received dozens of reports of workers in a range of fields, including health and justice, being abused, spat and coughed on. “We are telling you to stop it or you will cop it with a $5000 fine,” Mr Hazzard said. One of the two fines issued in Waverley was given to a man who allegedly coughed on a police officer and a fine in Shoalhaven was given to a man who allegedly spat at officers. Both men claimed to have COVID-19. At least another four of the fines involved abuse towards police officers. NSW Police have provided location details for 129 of the 151 fines issued since March 17. Of these, nearly half have been issued in regional areas, which account for about 35 per cent of the state’s 2800 confirmed cases. Eight fines have been issued in areas with no cases - Cobar, Narrabri, Bourke and Moree Plains. A NSW Police spokesperson said there was no correlation between the number of people with the virus in a specific area and the number of people who have breached the public health order. However, legal experts have raised concerns that the fines, which are $1000 for individuals and $5000 for businesses, could disproportionately affect people in lower socioeconomic areas. Professor in Criminology at the University of Sydney Law School Murray Lee said the data suggested a map of disadvantage could be emerging, whereby those in lower socioeconomic areas are more likely to be slugged with a hefty fine. “Fines are very blunt instruments and they do hurt those that are less able to pay,” he said. The most fines and court notices outside Sydney have been issued in Shoalhaven, with eight fines, and Wagga Wagga and Lake Macquarie, with five in each.

12,/national/scientists-divided-over-key-coronavirus-question-20200409-p54iot.html,Scientists divided over key coronavirus question,"A world expert in aerosols says the new coronavirus may be spreading more easily through the air than first thought - from breathing as well as coughing or sneezing in some cases. While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. The question of how easily the new coronavirus can spread in the air is still up for debate.Credit:AP A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk from aerosols may have been underestimated. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet. They can leave the body as both. “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. The Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading frequently in the air. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would likely look different- spreading faster and amongst more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results - some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska noted, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours, but it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier this month saying the current research supports the possibility COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus mostly aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO has warned healthcare workers this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 already operate as if it's airborne, including in Australia. ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put frontline workers at risk. But in the US, the CDC has reversed its own advice, now urging people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as in a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Professor Morawska agreed with the masks push, adding there should be more focus on the need for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. She is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for aerosol transmission. Associate Professor Senanayake said air conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the department agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low in hospitals. A spokeswoman said Australia's advice on masks had not changed on Thursday but the evidence on transmission was being reviewed all the time by the medical experts advising government. Professor MacIntyre and Associate Professor Senanayake said wearing masks in public was not so urgent for Australia compared to New York where there was rampant community transmission. “Perhaps somewhere like Sydney, where they’ve had local outbreaks they could help,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. ""But everyone just rushing out and wearing a mask won’t."" NSW Health said air conditioners and heating were considered safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and if possible, use a different bathroom...to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets...and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said.

Associate Professor Heather Cleland: ""People are ending up in intensive care beds with these injuries at a time when those beds are going to become very precious.""Credit:Vince Caligiuri  Many of the injuries being treated at the hospital's burns unit have been caused by hot oil with others resulting from people cooking while intoxicated. Associate Professor Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had noted a significant increase in patients with severe cooking-related burns. “We’ve seen burns from hot cooking oil catching fire, barbecue-related burns and scald burns from hot liquids,"" Associate Professor Cleland said. ""These burns usually involve hands, arms and faces. Frequently, people who are trying to deal with burning oil, pick it up and try and take it outside but what usually happens is the oil spills on them or they fall and slip into a puddle of burning oil. Replay   ""Sometimes, they open the back door and they get a big gust of air that makes the flames go up even further."" Associate Professor Cleland said more than half the burns unit was filled with people who had sustained kitchen, domestic or home-cooking injuries. Several of those had also been in the intensive care unit. ""People are ending up in intensive care beds with these injuries at a time when those beds are going to become very precious,"" she said. Across Australia intensive care units have yet to be overwhelmed with coronavirus patients – 13 people are being treated across Victoria for example – but authorities are expecting numbers to climb dramatically in May and June. The physical-distancing restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus have brought something of a lull to emergency rooms but unlike other trauma-related injuries such as those seen after car crashes burn injuries are on the rise.  ""Which is why we are trying to alert people to the fact these types of injuries can require admission to hospital, sometimes for weeks, and involve time in the intensive care unit, surgery and result in long-term scarring,"" Associate Professor Cleland. ""These are not trivial, minor injuries."" Associate Professor Cleland said the most common causes of cooking burns included hot oil catching fire, people being burnt after throwing accelerant on barbecues, clothes catching fire while cooking, spilling large saucepans of boiling water and splash burns from boiling water, hot oil or fat. “I also need to remind people once again that accelerant and flames do not mix,"" she said. ""We’ve seen a number of people badly burnt after pouring accelerant onto barbecues."" Associate Professor Cleland said the hospital had treated a broad range of age groups for cooking injuries because people were spending more time in their homes than they otherwise would. ""There's more kids around at home too so there are a combination of factors that are feeding into this rise,"" she said. Associate Professor Cleland was particularly concerned about older people who were over-represented among the burns patients being admitted to hospital. ""It's getting more difficult to support elderly people at home at the moment and when they are cooking they don't often have good eyesight,"" she said. ""They generally have poorer health outcomes too, when they do suffer burns."" Smothering the flames with an extinguisher or a fire blanket is the best practice, Associate Professor Cleland said. ""Clearly, the thing to do when you've got something like burning oil is to smother it,"" she said. ""So put a lid on it or use a chopping board, but everyone should have in their kitchen a fire extinguisher or a fire blanket.

""They generally have poorer health outcomes too, when they do suffer burns."" Smothering the flames with an extinguisher or a fire blanket is the best practice, Associate Professor Cleland said. ""Clearly, the thing to do when you've got something like burning oil is to smother it,"" she said. ""So put a lid on it or use a chopping board, but everyone should have in their kitchen a fire extinguisher or a fire blanket. ""It is tough being at home all the time but it’s far better than being in hospital with severe burns.""

The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said.

NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback. Dr Blake Cochran, a medical researcher and lecturer at UNSW, said it took just a couple of days to go from talking about potentially creating a face shield prototype to having products ready to test. “I never thought I'd work with industrial designers, it’s a creative approach to things,” he said. The face shields have been the focus of the UNSW team, but Dr Cochran said they would be happy to try designing something else. All it would take, he said, was for hospitals, local health districts or the health department to say “this is exactly what we need”. “Whatever the next need is, we’ve got really good people to help develop solutions,” he said.

Credit:Alex Ellinghausen ""Being physically distanced from others is going to impact everybody's mental health,"" Morgan told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. ""With Easter, that can bring with it a real sense of loneliness, especially if you are somebody who looks to your family for social connection."" Together with a team of mental health experts, Morgan crafted a series of practical tips on how to keep your mind healthy while housebound during the coronavirus lockdown. First, video call your family using apps like Zoom, Houseparty, FaceTime or What'sApp - don't just text or phone them. ""Staying connected with each other is more than just texting - there's quite a difference between that and Zooming, or getting on FaceTime, where you are able to actually see someone when you're having a conversation."" ""When you're each having a cup of coffee or tea and you're actually seeing their face, you're actually connecting with their facial expressions and their body, and are able to have a full interaction with them,"" the commissioner says. Morgan also recommends turning away from social media every now and then, and not check the news obsessively to avoid ""getting caught up in the hype"". Thirdly: have a routine.

Establishing a routine that suits you and gives you back a sense of choice can really help."" Replay   Morgan recommends regularly exercising, maintaining a good diet and sleeping well as part of the routine.

""Letting them talk it through in their own personal words lets them put what they're feeling into their own context,"" Morgan says. ""Ask them: 'How are you feeling? What does this all mean to you?'"" It helps to remain positive and discuss ways you can turn the lockdown into an enjoyable experience, she says. What is it that you can do at this time? What are some of the creative things we can do inside? Morgan has already started thinking beyond Easter and to a country that has overcome coronavirus but not without changes to the nation's psyche. ""Will it change us? I can't see that it won't. I think back to my grandparents who lived through the Great Depression, and those years stood with them for the rest of their lives.""

20,/national/how-rain-is-transforming-landscapes-and-the-emotions-of-rural-people-20200227-p5450i.html,How rain is transforming landscapes and the emotions of rural people,"I am drunk. Drunk on a landscape that has been transformed. Like most of Australia, my beef property here in central Queensland has been in drought for far too long, but in January a strange thing happened – it rained. Now there is grass so iridescent green, it almost blinds, and I am so full of joy, I want to shout from the top of the windmill (which I won’t do because I am a sook when it comes to heights) and tell the world how blessed I am to live in the bush. In a drought, those blessings can be harder to find. Dust storms are relentless. Willy-willies chase the dust (and desiccated cow manure) indoors. Friends clog the aisles in the local supermarket to talk and cry and hug and then return to dry farms and hungry animals. The heat bakes the land and hearts. Feral pigs move in – searching, like all life, for water. A dog dies. Mandy McKeesick's property before and after the rain.Credit:Mandy McKeesick Even in a drought I don’t think of myself as despondent, but in this current euphoric state I can reflect. Maybe that email I sent was abnormally terse. Maybe that phone call was a little callous. Maybe I overreacted to that post on social media. Maybe others saw what I could not. To all those people who saw, I now apologise if I am giddy and over-the-top. Somewhere, sometime I will plateau. I promise. I know the drought is not over. I know we need more rain. I know I have friends who are yet to see any of this miracle stuff that falls from the sky. I know these things, but my joy will not be restrained. I want to take a moment to be truly grateful for this rare and precious gift. The first rain came in January, swift and angry, sending water running over parched paddocks. The back dam, the day before barely large enough to float a duck, swelled. The lagoon started to fill. The creek, having been reduced to one shrinking, stinking, boggy hole, flowed and if you took the time, you could hear the red gums sucking up the water. But the frogs were silent. There is a patch of land below my house that I optimistically refer to as the wetlands. Usually after good rain, it is a riot of cacophonous frogs. But not this time. The water had run too swift and angry to penetrate the long-dry soil. I may not believe in the weatherman, but I believe in nature and I trust in frogs. I may not believe in the weatherman, but I believe in nature and I trust in frogs. The second rain came in February, of a similar amount, but this time soft and soaking. It took 48 hours but the frogs awakened – and only frogsong comes close to the sound of rain. Small brown frogs have taken up residence in the bathroom. Green tree frogs under the tank stand call to the one in the bedroom air conditioner – who shares lodgings with a gecko with irritatingly regular bowel movements. Snakes have taken up residence with the dogs – a python by Bonnie and six pieces of brown snake in Manu’s run. A hundred million biting mozzies want to feast on my blood. The cows are picking up. Their coats shine and they run and buck and fart and gallop through grass growing ahead of them. The camels have shed their winter coats and once again look majestic standing on a green ridge silhouetted by blue-black storm clouds. The dogs are grinning. Last year, a 12-kilometre lap around the farm was an arduous hot and dry ordeal. Now they climb out of a trough and splash into the lagoon, swim across the creek and race each other madly through puddles in paddocks. To live by nature is to live by her rules and her extremes. Each day brings new delights. Wildflowers (or weeds, depending on your point of view) dot-paint the land in purple and yellow as they begin the colonisation and repair of the soil. Pasture grasses thrive. Cuddles the koala reverse-parks into a fork of a poplar box. The rainwater tank overflows. I can even get partially excited about the novelty of mowing the lawn until I look at the mower, used once last year, with its flat tyres and flat battery, and consider just opening the gate for the cattle. And whenever I think that intoxication may be waning, I walk past a myrtle tree in full flower, the scent heavy and heady, and once again I am hopelessly infatuated with this country. To live by nature is to live by her rules and her extremes. This rain has transformed the landscape and it has transformed the minds of rural people, although without further prolonged rain we will quickly sober up and face our hangovers. We have a new problem in our collective midst, too, in the form of coronavirus. But this is a start. This is a glorious, bountiful, beautiful reminder of why I love rural Australia.

Many parts of the state are expecting rain and thunderstorms over the next eight days, with some areas set to collect up to 100 millimetres. A rain band moves across an increasingly locked down Sydney in Newport on Monday.Credit:Nick Moir From 9am on Sunday until 9am on Monday, parts of inland NSW, including the Central Tablelands and Central West regions, had up to 30 millimetres, while areas of the Hunter region recorded 18mm. By comparison, Sydney Olympic Park recorded the highest rainfall across the city at 5.2mm. While inland regions may move closer to being able to shed their drought-declared status and start planting winter crops in earnest, the Rural Fire Service is watching the forecast with some concern. The RFS and other fire agencies typically do the bulk of any hazard-reduction burning during the period from about mid-March until the end of May when conditions turn too wet. The NSW fires started in July last year, destroying 5.5 million hectares and thousands of houses, and killing 25 people. The eight-day rainfall map shows that some parts of NSW could see as much as 100 millimetres of rain. Credit:BOM The long fire season, which officially ends on Tuesday, has meant many fire crews were exhausted from the long months of battling blazes. With extended rain, the window for controlled burns to limit the fuel load could be delayed further. James Morris, an RFS spokesman, said the coronavirus might also play a role in limiting the ability to conduct such burns. For one thing, crews may be restricted in gathering in appropriate numbers. Secondly, they may need to avoid lighting fires during periods of particularly stable air - otherwise ideal conditions to limit the chance of runaway fires - to prevent large areas such as the Sydney Basin from being blanketed in bushfire smoke. ""We wouldn't want to do anything to cause more damage for those with respiratory issues,"" he said, noting many COVID-19 sufferers might live in the Sydney area. On Tuesday, parts of western Sydney will awake to fog, caused by recent rainfall and cooling temperatures. During the rest of the day there will be light showers and a top of 23 degrees. Thunderstorms are expected to continue across the state for the rest of the week, with an inland trough sitting over western NSW on Wednesday bringing heavier rain on Thursday and Friday. Some parts of the Central West plains are forecast to get up to 100 millimetres. ""Thursday and Friday will still see the rain push towards Sydney. While we're not going to see those higher totals, we'll still see that steady, light rain,"" Bureau of Meteorology's forecaster Olenka Duma said. ""It's not going to be a dry week for us.""

His father had seen something sticking out of the earth as he rode across the prairies of Montana, North America, long the heartland of dinosaur discovery, and it was there that he took little Jack fossil hunting. The bone still sits in Horner’s office today. The success of Jurassic Park in 1993 would launch a new generation of palaeontologists and an unprecedented boom for the field, opening up frontiers from Argentina to Australia and rewriting the story of the scaly monsters on screen. Within three years, on a hillside in China, a farmer had stumbled upon the world’s first glimpse of a feathered dinosaur. Today, close to one new dinosaur species is discovered every week. This year the big find to hit headlines is a new species, and likely a new genus, of tyrannosaur exhumed from the dust of Alberta, Canada, pictured above. Far from the image of the lumbering lizard doomed to extinction, palaeontologists now know dinosaurs as nature’s great success stories. In their 185-million-year reign on Earth, they weathered tremendous upheaval. Continents broke apart, volcanoes rained lava, temperatures and toxic gases climbed, monster wildfires scarred the land. Still dinosaurs spread to all its corners, growing to the size of passenger planes or emerging in strange new shapes including, eventually, as birds. In South America and Asia, whole new ecosystems are being unearthed, from huge spiked herbivores to strange bat-winged “vampires”. In outback Australia, a literal treasure trove of fossils has been found down an opal mine, many species preserved as vibrant gems. Now in another era of planetary change (this time of our own making), and with news from NASA that an asteroid nearly the size of the one that took out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago will soon sail hair-raisingly close to the Earth – what can we learn from these creatures? How has palaeontology evolved since Jurassic Park?  What discoveries have put Australia on the map? And will we ever bring a dinosaur back to life? An artist's reconstruction of thanatotheristes or the Reaper of Death, discovered this year.  Credit:Julius Csotonyi Horner sat next to director Steven Spielberg as a consultant on the set of Jurassic Park, and remembers well the hordes of students who suddenly signed up for his university classes after the film hit cinemas. But it wasn't a flash in the pan, says palaeontologist and author Steve Brusatte, who has himself helped discover somewhere in the order of 15 to 20 new dinosaurs. The students kept coming and today the resulting gold rush of discovery shows no signs of slowing down. ""We're not running out of dinosaurs,"" Brusatte laughs. Palaeontologist Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza has tracked the rate of new finds since the first bones were unearthed in the 1800s, including that sudden surge. He too belongs to the Jurassic Park generation, the scientists ""who never grew up"", but says better technology is also speeding up dinosaur hunting as they compare finds online. Out in the field, Horner says the tools are still mostly what they were when he started. Dinosaur bones eventually become rock (and in some places, such as Australia, gem stone), which makes them nearly impossible to pick out from the landscape with scanners. Yet, back in the lab, X-rays, 3D printing, even molecular particle accelerators now come into play. ""And we can send drones out for us now to take pictures,” Horner says. All of those fresh eyes in the field can sometimes catch what has been missed. This year’s new tyrannosaur on the block gathered dust in a museum cabinet for almost a decade before PhD student Jared Voris decided to take a closer look. Now dubbed the Reaper of Death, the tyrannosaur is the oldest found in Canada. In life, it would have been about the length of two cars. ""We're confident it's a new genus as well as a new species,"" Voris says. ""The ridges in the jaw and the [shape of] the cheekbones are really different."" But sometimes, Horner warns, the hype can get ahead of the science. Many dinosaurs vary wildly in size and shape over their life cycle and baby dinosaurs have on occasion been ""discovered"" as their own separate species.

Credit:Royal Tyrrell Museum  To survive the tens of millions of years between death and discovery, dinosaur remains need cover from the elements. Most will decay completely but sometimes the conditions are just right for preservation - usually when an animal dies near water and is buried under sediment such as mud or silt. Water infused with minerals will seep into the hard, longer-wearing parts, the bones or teeth, as they break down, gradually replacing and encasing them. Over millennia, they are compressed into rock or ""fossil"". Sometimes other substances such as tar or ice can do an even better job of preserving the original remains, leading to remarkable discoveries such as intact feathers or even soft tissue. An artist's impression of the seven-metre-long Lightning Claw, the largest carnivorous dinosaur found in Australia. On Australia's west coast, some of the world's largest surviving dinosaur footprints are still in the rock, spanning almost two metres each. But it is on the east coast that most of Australia's fossil record is being dug up – and it's taken a “quantum leap forward” in the past few years, according to the Australian Museum. One hundred million years ago, in the last great age of dinosaurs known as the Cretaceous period, the dry continent was lush and green. Pterosaurs or “iron dragons” ruled the skies and ancient crocodiles shared hunting grounds with creatures such as Lightning Claw, pictured above, the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever found in Australia, with its ""grappling hooks"" for hands. Much of the east was swamped by a shallow inland sea – creating the perfect conditions for fossils. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove."" While our most complete dinosaur skeletons have come from Queensland, opal miners in remote NSW have stumbled upon the most beautiful. Down a mine shaft in Lightning Ridge is one of the richest fossil collections ever discovered from Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that once accounted for two-thirds of today’s land, including Australia. Here, dinosaur remains were buried under reactive minerals – glass or silica ash – from a chain of volcanoes erupting up north near the Great Barrier Reef at the time. Under the ""Martian-like"" conditions, the most unique opals in the world took shape in the rock – and in dinosaur bone. “It seems to be the only place in the world where the dinosaur fossils have turned to opals so it’s literally a treasure trove,” laughs Phil Bell, a palaeontologist at the University of New England. ""Some species have rich veins of colour through them, blues and reds."" Fossils have been picked out of opal hauls since mining began at the site in the 1900s – Australia's first prehistoric mammals were discovered there as well as some dinosaur species. But it’s hard work, climbing metres down rickety ladders into black chasms to dig with pick axes and jackhammers. Most of what’s been found has come off the back of the miners themselves. Even then, no one had studied the fossils in depth until 2013, when Bell ventured into the dark beneath Lightning Ridge and found a wealth of life, including Lightning Claw and an entire herd of the plant eater Fostoria. ""Not all of the bones are gem-quality, a lot are just the dark or opaque part of the opal, but some of those Fostoria bones do shimmer with the entire spectrum of colours,"" Bell says. ""These things are worth tens of thousands of dollars as jewellery but they're priceless as fossils.""

Credit:James Kuether They are so precious that palaeontologists and the Australian Opal Centre are working with the local mining community to save them from commercial trade. When broken up for their gems, the fossils fetch a decent sum. But in a region hit hard by drought, they can bring more value, the argument goes, as a tourist attraction. ""Until Lightning Ridge, we'd been dealing with scraps from Victoria's coast and Queensland,"" Bell explains. ""We had those beautiful big [sauropod] tracks in Broome but that was our sole image of what dinosaurs in Australia looked like. Suddenly, here was this virtually untapped window into our past.""

While ""bone wars"" have been raging since the 1800s, as paleontologists and collectors haggled over finds, the field's technology boom has also made it easier for black market traders to beat researchers to sites. Of course, a lot of dinosaur hunting depends on whose land you're on and regulation varies between countries and states. In Canada, all discoveries are the property of the Crown. In much of Australia and other parts of the world, if the bones are found on private land, they belong to that landowner. If they are held in a private collection, many paleontologists consider them scientifically worthless as they cannot be studied by others. Like a rare Rembrandt, T-Rex skeletons and other fossils are fast becoming status symbols and stolen bones routinely surface at high-profile auctions with forged paperwork. A bidding war reportedly broke out between actors Nicolas Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio over a $276,000 dinosaur skull. Cage won but had to return the skull in 2015 when it emerged it had been smuggled illegally out of Mongolia, a mecca for fossils but also a hot spot for dinosaur crime, Bell warns. He is one of a growing number of paleontologists now using hand-held Star-Trek style scanners ""a bit like hairdryers"" to trace the chemical fingerprints of bones and so help determine where they might have been poached from. In Australia, our rare opalised fossils cannot be exported without a permit (which are hard to come by). But their rarity makes them highly sought after on the black market. China's long-snouted tyrannosaur Qianzhousaurus, nicknamed Pinocchio Rex.Credit:Zhao Chuang As palaeontology itself evolves, dig sites are becoming less of a graveyard and more of a crime scene. Researchers hunt for clues that will tell them not just the kind of animal they've found but how it lived. Dinosaurs, like sharks, shed their teeth often, Bell says, and in sites such as Lightning Ridge, palaeontologists can piece together whole ecosystems. X-rays can help them look inside dinosaur brains and see where arteries once carved around the bones. Fossils can be 3D printed, and species run through the same engineering software used to test the structural integrity of dams and bridges to explore how they would have moved, if they could fly, the way T-Rex really handled those tiny arms. The newly unveiled tyrannosaur find also provides clues about the ecology of North America during the Cretaceous period – further evidence, according to Voris, of an apparent split in the land between 89 million and 74 million years ago. “In the north, Montana, Alberta, we see really different species to further south, like Utah, alive at the exact same time but there's nothing in the land so far we've found to tell us why,” he says. “We have to keep digging.” Above: A new species of raptor, Zhenyuanlong, which Brusatte helped discover in China and an impression by Zhao Chuang of the creature, which couldn't fly.  In parts of the world such as China, whole areas have been preserved under almost Pompeii-like conditions by past volcanic eruptions or sudden floods, allowing scientists to find remarkably well-preserved feathers. Under X-rays, they've even extrapolated the colour pigments, turning the old drab green and brown dinosaur palette on its head in an explosion of flamboyant blues, reds and yellows. Given feathers appeared on many species too big to fly, Brusatte says it’s likely the filaments didn’t evolve for the purpose of taking to the skies and might have first been used in mating display. But while feathers on species such as velociraptor were met with a lot of fanfare (some museum collections changed their exhibits overnight), elsewhere scientists such as Bell have examined the scaly skin of a T-Rex. “The hype around feathers kind of steamrolled a lot of other evidence,” Bell says. “There were lots of feathered dinosaurs but we still [think] most had scaly skin.” Of course, just as it would be difficult to discover from skeletons many of the wonders of the natural world today, from whale song to lyrebird mimicry, Chiarenza says there are things palaeontology will likely never know. ""Because of the way fossils form, we'll probably never find animals that lived in the mountains,"" he says. ""There might have been all kinds of strange creatures there, like we have gorillas and [big cats] today."" Jack Horner digging up a triceratops in Montana.Credit:Jack Horner The holy grail of palaeontology is still dinosaur DNA. It was Horner's own research on dinosaur babies that helped inspire Michael Crichton to write Jurassic Park – Sam Neill would go on to play the role based on Horner, Dr Alan Grant, in the film adaptation. While Horner didn’t meet Crichton until they were both pressed into the back of a limousine en route to its premiere, the author’s wild idea – that dinosaur DNA could be extracted from ancient preserved mosquitoes – lit the fuse for his next phase of research: could we really build a dinosaur? DNA breaks down fast, even in the belly of a mosquito, and the amount needed to create a dinosaur would be much more than palaeontologists could ever dream to find, Horner says. Still, there have been flashes of hope over the years, including the breakthrough discovery of soft tissue and intact blood proteins in a T-Rex bone by his student Mary Schweitzer. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction. Their genes still carry the building blocks of ancient dinosaurs – but many of their dino traits have been “turned off” over the course of evolution. But Horner has a Plan B: one he’s dubbed ""chickenosaurus"" for the school kids. Birds are the dinosaurs that escaped extinction. Their genes still carry the building blocks of ancient dinosaurs – but many of their dino traits have been “turned off” over the course of evolution. Just as there have been rare cases of humans born with a tail or a snake with legs, Horner’s plan is to flick back on the dormant lines of genetic code in a chicken. “We've found the genes we need to turn back on to change the head, the arms, the legs, to grow teeth,"" Horner says. ""But we can't figure out how to make the tail. That doesn't seem to be a [dormant or] atavistic gene."" That means the team will now have to turn to high-tech genetic engineering tools, likely the DNA editor CRISPR--Cas9, to finish the job and ""keep the fourth-graders happy"". ""But getting university backing to use a new tool like that, to create a novelty, it's not going to happen soon,"" Horner says. When it comes to solving the mystery of what killed the dinosaurs, meanwhile, scientists have almost closed the case. The suspect pool has now been mostly whittled down from volcanoes, toxic gases and even chronic constipation, to a world-shattering asteroid hit one June day 66 million years ago. The chunk of rock to blame was at least 10 kilometres wide and it hit with the force of more than a billion nuclear bombs, punching a hole in the Earth's crust in what is now the Gulf of Mexico. It also exposed, according to many in the field, the vulnerability of any biological empire on Earth – including humanity. With the world today facing threats from human-induced global warming and large-scale species extinction, and now another deadly virus, NASA has offered yet more sobering news: an asteroid almost as big as the dinosaur killer will shoot past Earth in a matter of weeks. We'll escape harm, but it'll be a near thing in astronomical terms. Horner says that while the importance of studying dinosaurs ""might still be lost on some people"" they can tell us more about the world than ever before, a glimpse into both evolution and extinction.

The Six Foot Track Marathon between Katoomba and the Jenolan Caves, which was due to be held on March 14, was cancelled last week because of damage to the track and access roads. Fires and floods have caused at least $1.5 million worth of damage to walking tracks managed by the Blue Mountains City Council. Blue Mountains mayor Mark Greenhill said the council could not afford the damage bill created by this summer’s natural disasters. “Tourism is vital to the Blue Mountains economy and much of our tourism infrastructure will remain closed until funding is available,” he said. Andy Mein, the manager of Blue Mountains Adventure Company, estimated the tourism business had lost $100,000 - 60 per cent of its income - and half its customers because of the bushfire crisis, which had drastically curtailed the number of tours it can offer. “The likelihood of recovering lost income with what remains in the summer peak season is extremely minimal,” he said. The company is one of several Blue Mountains-based operators that will donate the proceeds of tours this weekend to repair fire and flood-damaged areas as part of Adventure Aid. Mr Mein said other tour operators had suffered similar declines in income and customers. Adventure guides have struggled to find work because of the closure of large sections of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area.Credit:Dean Sewell  The NPWS has slowly been reopening wilderness areas, including canyons near Mount Wilson, but Mr Mein said the perception that “all is blackened” in the Blue Mountains was still discouraging the return of visitors. Mr Mein said the lack of work had caused hardship for guides, who are casually employed. “I am aware that two of our guides have had to live rough in a camp cave for a period of time – thankfully now past,” he said. “Dumpster diving has also been a necessity.” Some guides had been forced to seek work elsewhere, Mr Mein said. “We have had days when we’ve missed work due to limited guides.” An NPWS spokeswoman said the agency was working closely with commercial tour operators to ensure popular areas are prioritised for repairs and re-opening. “We will continue to focus on getting all areas open as soon as they can be assessed for fire and flood hazards and made safe,” she said. She said the NPWS was in discussions with the council to “utilise the skills” of guides to assess damage to the national park. The NSW government has been running a marketing campaign to attract visitors to regional destinations as part of its Tourism Recovery Package. Grants of up to $50,000 and loans of up to $500,000 are available to small businesses “directly affected” by bushfires, NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro said. But Mr Mein said there was an underlying sense of anger in the region towards the government. “We have stomached a lot of lip-service with minimal timely assistance,” he said.

The university, in Melbourne’s east, said it would ensure students had options beyond the traditional competitive ranking system when it came to gaining entry to tertiary study next year. Swinburne University will delay the start of semester one next year.  The move comes after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on Tuesday he would ask universities to delay the start of the academic year, following his government’s decision to push back end-of-year exams until December or even January. The exams are a major determinant of a VCE student’s study score and Australian Tertiary Admission Rank – the competitive ranking system universities use as a gauge to control entry into many courses. Swinburne committed on Wednesday to delay the start of semester one next year “to coincide with any changes made by the government to year 12”. “This is to accommodate the shift in VCE timelines for year 12 students in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 situation,” a university spokesperson said. The university also said it would offer this year’s crop of year 12 students places based on their year 11 and year 12 work. “We will be sharing details of our approach with secondary schools later in 2020,” the spokesperson said. Swinburne is the first Victorian university to publicly commit to altering its admissions process for domestic students next year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. School students learned this week that all of term two would be taught remotely. Victoria University will guarantee a place for students based on their year 11 results, if the student resides in Melbourne's western suburbs, part of its ""VU guarantee"". Interstate institutions, including the Australian National University and the University of Western Australia, have also committed to changing their admissions processes, including allowing students to apply based on a predicted ATAR derived from their year 11 results. Peter Hurley, policy fellow at Victoria University’s Mitchell Institute, said all universities would have to broaden their admissions criteria next year in response to COVID-19, including looking beyond the ATAR as the benchmark. “There is an idea that the ATAR is the only way into university and it is not,” Mr Hurley said. “There are lots of different pathways into university and often ATARs reflect student family background and socio-economic status.” Schools also liked to use the ATAR to trumpet their students’ superior academic results compared with other schools, he said. “We can do without that for a year, can’t we?” Other major Victorian universities said they were still assessing their response to the disruption. La Trobe University said it was “actively developing a range of options to support prospective students to enter university study in addition to the traditional ATAR based entry options”. Deakin University’s deputy vice-chancellor Professor Liz Johnson said the regional university “will ensure VCE students have a clear and supported pathway to study in 2021”. The University of Melbourne said it would consider options for its admissions processes after it learned more about changes to year 12 certificates in other states.

Although a figure has not been set, councillors have asked staff to develop ways to financially support overseas students, many of whom have lost casual jobs in retail and hospitality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are about 200,000 overses students in Melbourne.Credit:Joe Armao They have also backed calls by the International Education Association of Australia for a hardship fund for foreign students, which could take contributions from the council, other levels of government, universities and the private sector. On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said international students and other visa holders were ""not held here compulsorily"". ""If they're not in a position to be able to support themselves, then there is the alternative for them to return to their home countries,"" he said. ""At this time, Australia must focus on its citizens and its residents to ensure that we can maximise the economic supports that we have."" Replay   The following day Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said international students had been a terrific contributor to Australia, supporting Australian jobs. ""We want them to stay here where they can support themselves,"" he said. He said the government was providing additional flexibility for them to support themselves and was continuing to work with the international education sector on future arrangements. Mr Tudge said international students working in aged care, as nurses and in major supermarkets had had the hours they were allowed to work every fortnight extended to support these critical sectors. On Tuesday night, the council voted to ask staff to develop further measures to support international students financially and in kind during this time. “Contrary to reports from other levels of government, not only do we welcome international students to our city, but we hope that they remain here with us in our comparatively safe country during these dangerous times,” Cr Jackie Watts said. She said the Prime Minister’s comments were “clearly counterproductive on a number of levels”. “The alarm and anxiety amongst international students is real and growing and they need reassurance that we value them and are endeavouring to keep them safe with us in Melbourne,” Cr Watts said. Melbourne is home to 200,000 international students from 170 countries, including 52,000 international students who live or study in the central city. International education is the state’s biggest export earner, contributing $12 billion to the Victorian economy last year. International students are allowed to work up to 20 hours a week but many have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 shutdown and are not eligible for government welfare or the new JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes. “It’s an appalling way to treat people who have made a considerable investment in our economy,” said the association's chief executive Phil Honeywood. By contrast, he said New Zealand had allowed international students access to the equivalent of their JobKeeper scheme, provided them with free health services and automatically extended student visas until December. “We are not in the ballpark when it comes to showing humanity and support for these young people.” He said international students were not able to return home in many cases because flights to their country had been grounded or the cost was prohibitively high. “We are going to have a situation in the next couple of weeks in the absence of any support where we will have footage of international students in the streets,” Mr Honeywood said. “I congratulate Melbourne City Council on being the first local government in Australia to commit to this vital issue.” The council also agreed to establish a free resume checking service for international students, deliver programs to international students online and match international students affected by the pandemic with local startups. Cr Nicholas Reece said that while he believed comments that international students should go home were a “misstatement”, they had created genuine worry for students who were already doing it tough. “They were a punch on a bruise for the international students of Melbourne,” he said.

The Victorian government hopes schools will be able to hold end-of-year exams in December instead of through October and November. But they could extend into January if the coronavirus’ threat lingers, or potentially be cancelled altogether, with an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank derived from a mix of school-assessed coursework, General Achievement Test results and year 11 results. The lack of clarity about how the most important year of their schooling will work has left many year 12 students frustrated and upset. Peter Goss, the Grattan Institute’s education fellow, said this year’s crop of year 12s would be disadvantaged even further if the school year was not extended.  “School isn’t just about turning up; school is for learning,” Dr Goss said. “We should be aiming for students to have as good a year of learning in 2020 as possible to set them up for whatever they do in 2021. “One way to do that is by extending the school year, given that so much of the year will be disrupted and the evidence strongly suggests that students on average learn less through online learning than face-to-face.” He also said it was likely that students from  disadvantaged backgrounds would fall even further behind, due to a lack of effective support at home. Madeleine Pirruccio, a year 12 student at Santa Maria College in Northcote, said she was “feeling frustrated” and would rather finish the school year at the normal time, even if it meant missing out on an ATAR. “We feel we have been robbed of our final year of schooling by the cancellation of athletics carnivals, formals and 18th birthdays and would rather finish this year and have summer to make up for our lost time, making memories,” she says.

There are calls to scrap VCE exams this year, rather than extend year 12 into January.

The Andrews government is yet to announce if students will return to face-to-face classes in term two, which begins on April 15. But it is widely expected that most students will be taught remotely in term two and potentially into term three. Premier Daniel Andrews also said on Sunday that it was possible that end-of-year VCE exams would be pushed back six to eight weeks, potentially into early 2021, so that year 12 students could get an ATAR score. But Ms Podbury said an ATAR could be derived just as effectively and with less stress for students by cancelling end-of-year exams. “We talk about taking the panic factor out, which is there in every VCE year; it’s horrendous to watch as a principal,” she said. Replay   “This might be an opportunity to do things differently. We don’t need the end-of-year exams.” Ms Podbury said students could be given a credible ATAR by combining their assignment results with results from the GAT, or General Achievement Test, a general literacy and numeracy test that is sat by all VCE students. Victoria’s Education Minister James Merlino has already flagged delaying the GAT, which is generally sat in June. “If we get to a place where we can actually set the kids down for an exam, let that be the GAT,” Ms Podbury said. Professor John Hattie, Director of the University of Melbourne’s Graduate School of Education, also rejected the notion of extending the school year for senior students. Professor Hattie noted that the Australian school year is already the longest in the world. “We still don’t perform as well as Estonia, Sweden and Finland, who have even fewer days, even if we took 10 weeks out,” he said. “At this stage I think we should be saying to our year 12 students, take this as an opportunity to do some deep work in some areas, but let’s not panic about what will happen at the end of the year.” Professor Hattie also previously advised New Zealand's school education authority on what to do in the aftermath of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. He said he argued very strongly to leave the timeline for the school year untouched. “That was the best year students ever had with their performance and the year after, they went backwards,” he said. “The reason for that is teachers started to be concerned about what the students need to know and what they needed to learn, as opposed to, ‘Come to my class and I’ll tell you what you need to know’.” Federal and state education ministers will meet on Tuesday to look at what can be done to minimise the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on students' studies, especially year 12s heading into tertiary education and work.

 The same thing will happen at 4pm in the handsome bluestone church, built in 1856. It will be, says Deacon Brian Lineker, the first time in the history of St Stephen's church and its humble antecedents in the town of Portland, south-west Victoria, that services have not been held for the public at Easter. “Until now, our services have been held every Sunday without a single break since the first week that Edward Henty stepped ashore in Portland in 1834,” said Reverend Lineker, referring to the man generally credited with being the first European settler in Victoria, though sealers and the whaler William Dutton had been there before. “The Sunday services didn’t stop for world wars or even the 1919 Spanish flu pandemic or the polio epidemic in 1937.” The current coronavirus pandemic, however, has closed the doors of every place of worship in Australia on the instructions last month of federal and state governments. Among other historic bluestone churches in Portland closed down are the graceful Catholic All Saints Church, built above the town's harbour in 1857, and Wesley Church, now a Uniting Church, built in 1865. Since the closure, either Reverend Lineker or his fellow cleric, Deacon Alan Ford, have performed lonely prayer services, morning and evening, at St Stephen’s. They admit they lack the technical ability to stream the services via the internet. The two deacons devote part of each day to phoning parishioners to ensure their needs are being met. The lack of a congregation for services, however, is causing a crisis of purpose, Reverend Lineker says. “I’m also the chaplain to the Mission to Seafarers here in Portland, but of course that’s not operating. I’m the chaplain to three nursing homes, and I’m not allowed to enter any of them, either. “So I give the morning and evening prayers alone, and I go for a run. It’s a difficult time.""

42,/national/victoria/state-refuses-to-prop-up-childcare-centres-facing-cash-crisis-20200409-p54in9.html,State refuses to prop up childcare centres facing cash crisis,"The Victorian government has ruled out propping up the struggling childcare sector, as NSW and the federal government move to extend childcare funding payments to council-run centres. On Thursday morning NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the government would spend $82 million to support the 260 council childcare centres not eligible for the federal government's JobKeeper payments. Not our responsibility: James Merlino says the federal government must address childcare funding shortfalls. Credit:Ellen Smith But Victorian Education Minister James Merlino dug in, saying it was not the state's job to fund childcare. ""Funding for childcare has always been and continues to be the responsibility of the federal government,"" Mr Merlino said. ""The federal government can’t pick and choose which childcare services it deems to be more important. Every service should be treated equally. ""We need local council-run services and all not-for-profit services to remain open in these challenging times. I have already raised this issue with [Federal Education Minister] Dan Tehan and I will continue to do so until he does the right thing and provides the funding they deserve."" Since the federal government announced it would offer free childcare to more than 1 million families, council-run centres and some non-profits have warned they will have to close if they don't get urgent funding to match other providers. The temporary $1.6 billion package is not means tested and replaces the previous childcare funding platform for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic. Federal Education Minister Mr Tehan has said 60 per cent of the costs of a childcare centre are wages, and the JobKeeper subsidy will support the sector ""to the tune of over $1 billion"". But not every centre qualifies for JobKeeper payments, and on Thursday The Age revealed that dozens of Victorian centres face imminent closure due to an ""unintended consequence"" of the federal government changes. To qualify for JobKeeper, non-profits must suffer a 15 per cent drop in revenue. But those drops are calculated at an organisational level, rather than at a childcare centre level. Uniting Vic and Tas operates 58 early learning services across two states and employs 550 people who care for more than 2300 children. Childcare accounts for 14 per cent of Uniting Vic and Tas' operations, so even if its centres lost all revenue, they would not qualify. Council-run centres also do not qualify for JobKeeper. The federal Department of Education, Skills and Employment issued guidelines on Thursday for centres wanting to apply for exceptional circumstance supplementary payments. Supplementary payments will be available to local government-run centres, non-profits and the private sector, although they are intended as a ""top up"" for centres already receiving relief payments. It is unclear how many centres that don't qualify for funding will be successful. The Andrews government says it is already doing more than its fair share for the early learning sector, having last week announced it would spend $45 million on free sessional kindergarten for term two, regardless of the organisational structure of the centre.

43,/national/victoria/andrews-warns-victorians-to-prepare-for-social-distancing-long-haul-20200409-p54ipr.html,Andrews warns Victorians to prepare for social distancing 'long haul',"Victorians should brace for “many months” of social distancing restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 with Premier Daniel Andrews warning again that an even tougher regime could not be ruled out. Despite the federal government signalling this week that some state governments may consider relaxing movement restrictions and industry shutdowns, Mr Andrews’ office confirmed on Thursday that Victoria committed to its strict social distancing stance for at least the medium term. Premier Daniel Andrews says there is a long road ahead.Credit:Justin McManus Prime Minister Scott Morrison echoed Mr Andrews’ sentiments after Thursday afternoon’s meeting of the national cabinet, with Mr Morrison saying the nation would be living with the virus for at least six months. State and federal leaders remain deeply worried about the potential of Easter holidaymakers moving around in large numbers and unleashing a fresh wave of coronavirus infections which could quickly get out of control. But NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was forced to hose down reports on Wednesday that her government was considering allowing cafes and restaurants to reopen as early as May 1. The retail industry group was encouraging its members this week to reopen shops which had been shut in response to the crisis, if the outlets could comfortably comply with social distancing calls, in a move that sparked a warning from an infectious disease expert of a “secondary wave” of coronavirus infections. Replay   But the Victorian government is adamant in its stance that any relaxation of the rules, or any complacency in the public response to social distancing, could result in a public health catastrophe akin to those in New York, Italy and Spain. The state’s health authorities are not even at the point where they can plan for a dismantling of the social distancing regime, saying there is not yet a body of evidence that would allow a plan to be developed. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton was asked this week which restrictions might be the first to go and said he and his colleagues were not even close to being able to answer the question. “I can’t say,” Dr Sutton said. “There's a lot to work to do with modellers, with getting a better understanding of how these restrictions have made a difference, both here in Australia and internationally. “We will try to make really fully informed decisions because they're important decisions to make about how and when we might pare back on some of those restrictions. “But we don't have definitive enough evidence at the moment as to how have we might proceed with that.” The Premier said that far from considering relaxing restrictions, his government was still preparing to impose deeper social distancing measures, saying he could not tell when the crisis might pass. “We have to be prepared for the long haul,” the Premier said. “If this was an influenza pandemic we could wait for a vaccine because we would know there’s a vaccine coming ... but this is a bit different. “A vaccine for this type of virus is not something that has been done before but all our medical experts are confident that we can can get to that point ... but that is not weeks, that is months and it may be many many months.” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

Emergency services were called to the scene on Oxley Station Road about 2pm on Thursday after reports of a traffic crash. Replay   People were urged to avoid part of the southern suburb of Oxley as emergency services responded to the incident – the second police shooting this week. Multiple vehicles were reported to be involved, with footage from the scene showing one car crumpled into the rear of another and a person being carried into an ambulance. Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming said police would allege the young man ""stole a car under some duress towards another person"" in the nearby suburb of Darra before travelling along Seventeen Mile Rocks Road. The man crashed into the back of another car at an intersection then abandoned the stolen vehicle while carryng a knife. The driver of the second car stayed inside out of fear for his safety. Queensland police have shot a man in Oxley after an alleged rampage on Thursday afternoon.Credit:Nine News Queensland / Twitter ""I’m told that the first man then ran down the road and attempted to steal another car ... but was unable to leave the car park,"" Superintendent Fleming said, noting it was still very early in the investigation. He said a bystander in his early 20s, who went to the aid of a woman and was struck by the vehicle during the man's attempt to flee, had been taken to hospital. The man then ran down the road and was seen by a lone officer who was driving towards a nearby park. After conversations with witnesses led the officer to the man, he tried to negotiate before firing a taser. ""It's my understanding that was not successful,"" Superintendent Fleming said. ""He was then threatened with the knife, where he feared for his safety, and he discharged a number of rounds from his police-issued pistol."" The man was struck in the torso and was immediately helped by officers. Paramedics were called and took him to hospital in a serious condition. The police ethical standards command, with oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission, will investigate the matter. On Monday police fatally shot a man who had set himself alight and ran at officers in a Sunnybank Hills car park. Anyone with information is urged to contact Policelink on 13 14 44 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Matt Dennien is a reporter for the Brisbane Times.

The Bucasia man was charged with unlawful use of a motor vehicle, serious assault and possession of dangerous drugs after the incident in north Mackay on Wednesday. Replay   He was due to face Mackay Magistrates Court on Thursday. It followed an incident in the Lockyer Valley in which a car was stolen from a shop car park with a three-year-old boy still inside. The child's 31-year-old pregnant mother suffered minor injuries trying to open the driver-side door as the thief drove off from the Glenore Grove Store, west of Brisbane, about 6am on Tuesday. Police are now searching for the man, who stopped a short distance down Brightview Road to let the unharmed boy out, before continuing east in the white Hyundai i30. The man was described as Caucasian, about 170 centimetres tall, with a slim build, short brown hair and blue eyes. Gatton detectives have appealed for anyone with dashcam footage or information about the incident to contact Policelink on 13 14 44 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

The report, tabled in WA Parliament on Thursday, was a follow-up from a 2018 investigation into an incident at a country town lock-up, where a man was ‘leg-sweeped’ by an officer while handcuffed. The report was tabled in parliament on Thursday.Credit:Justin Rake The man sustained severe ligament damage to his knee and a further internal investigation into the officer’s behaviour found he was also responsible for an incident where another man’s arm was broken during an arrest months later. Officers had been called to respond to a domestic incident but the man was too intoxicated to cause a problem, yet the report found the officer had still used excessive force when arresting him. Following a CCC investigation into both incidents, it was recommended WA Police consider ‘bespoke’ training for officers who demonstrated a pattern of excessive force in the line of duty. ""Following its review of a WA Police Force investigation and response into a disturbing use of force incident, the Commission made four recommendations in March 2018, relating to officer training and changes to policy,"" the report said. “The commission's review found that the WA Police considered the evidence regarding [the senior constable’s] use of force and dealt with the matter adequately. “However, the commission noted [the senior constable’s] extensive complaints history and questioned the effectiveness of previous managerial interventions.” Following the investigation, WA Police implemented a new system where complaints and conduct-related incidents were recorded and, where necessary, officers were recommended for reasonable force training. Officers were stood down from operational duties while training and as of January 2020, eight officers had completed their training. The CCC said while it was encouraging to see WA Police had displayed a ""significant commitment"" to addressing the issues raised in its 2018 report, there were still three outstanding recommendations that needed to be addressed. These included making WA Police's policy around use of force clearer, as it was currently up to officers about whether they filed a report about any action they needed to take around a person in custody. The current use of force policy meant the officer involved in both incidents investigated by the CCC did not feel he needed to fill out a report about his actions, as the men involved did not seek medical help until the day after their arrests. “The commission considers the WA Police's response to three of the recommendations complete, noting that there has been limited progress in response to the fourth recommendation, which relates to policy reform,"" the report said.

50,/national/western-australia/unions-claim-new-rosters-disregard-fifo-mental-health-code-20200409-p54iq3.html,Unions claim new rosters disregard FIFO mental health code,"Some of the state’s biggest construction unions claim new rosters employed by oil and gas giants to reduce movement to and from sites defy the WA government’s FIFO mental health code of practice. In a joint statement on Thursday the AMWU, Electrical Trades Union and CFMEU slammed rosters that require two weeks of isolation in addition to standard work and rest periods and called for policies to be changed to allow them to isolate at home. Unions have slammed new FIFO rosters.Credit:Glenn Hunt Woodside rosters are moving to two weeks of isolation, four weeks of work and two weeks of rest while Chevron only requires its eastern states workers to do the isolation period after entering WA. The mental health code of practice was released in 2019 in an effort to improve support for FIFO workers after years of high suicide rates. Unions claimed workers who moved to Karratha with their families would be forced to isolate away from home, meaning by the end of their work roster they would have spent six weeks away from their loved ones. Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union state secretary Steve McCartney labelled the changes a ‘divorce roster’ and said workers should be allowed to isolate at home. “We understand COVID-19 restrictions are important to the health and safety of workers and their families over the next six months, but there are better ways to go about it to ensure we don’t compromise the mental health of workers,” he said. “Why do these workers have to be locked away in a box, when all other workers in WA, including those on the front line, go home to their families? It’s not fair and a continuation of this over the next six months or so will have serious consequences. “We would support three weeks on, three weeks off, with workers allowed to isolate at home. The only other option they have been given is to stand alongside their mates who have been stood down, it puts them in a very vulnerable situation.” CFMEU state secretary Mick Buchan said the FIFO mental health code of practice was there to protect basic social wellbeing and mental health of workers and now was not the time to ‘throw it out the window.’ “This is the time to do exactly the opposite,” he said. “To make an even greater effort to make sure the work schedules and working demands on these West Australians are not at odds with their own wellbeing or the basic emotional and logistical needs of their families.” The 2/4/2 roster was a dramatic step down from an original 14-week roster proposal. A Woodside spokeswoman said the 2/4/2 roster was developed in consultation with its workforce and it was working hard to support the mental health of its workers. “The decision criteria applied when considering the most appropriate temporary operating model included personal safety, the mental health and wellbeing of our people, process safety, licence to operate, business resilience and workforce, community and regulatory engagement,” she said. “With the support of mental health specialists, we have introduced additional measures to support our people and their families at work and at home as we all adapt to the temporary operating model.” Chevron reiterated the isolation period only applied to eastern states FIFO workers and a spokeswoman said it was continuously reviewing its mental health support provided to employees. “We have consulted extensively with our employees on proposed temporary changes to work pattern arrangements and appreciate their understanding, flexibility and commitment during this unprecedented time,” she said. Health Minister Roger Cook said he was confident resources companies could strike the balance between keeping workers employed and looking after their mental health.

Jonathan David is accused of failing to comply with a self-isolation directive issued under the Emergency Management Act in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic after flying into Perth from Victoria on March 27. Jonathan David is accused of sneaking out of his room at the Travelodge Hotel Perth to see his girlfriend while in 14-day quarantine. Credit:Facebook After unsuccessfully applying for bail in the Perth Magistrates Court on Monday, the 35-year-old tried for a second time on Thursday, with his request again denied. Defence lawyer Gregory Chin claimed his client’s circumstances had changed during the week and bail should have been granted as his 14-day isolation period had now finished. He said being remanded in custody had been a wake-up call for the father-of-two to realise the severity of his actions, but Magistrate Edwards De Vries questioned Mr David’s remorse. “He wasn’t aware that about 1.5 million people worldwide have contracted this virus?” he said. “And he wasn’t aware that tens of thousands of people throughout the world have died through this virus? ""That millions of people in Australia have lost their jobs because of the virus? People have died in Australia because of it – he wasn’t aware of that?” Police prosecutor Raymond Lee, in opposing Mr David’s bail application, said he had “no moral compass”. “He was seen to leave five times on CCTV before police then went and charged him on the first occasion – that you thought would have rang alarm bells but he went and did it again,"" he said. ""Everyone’s going through hardship, I haven’t seen a family member of mine for four weeks, yet he just goes off to his girlfriend’s house whenever he feels like it. Replay   “If he was convicted ... I’d be asking for an immediate term of imprisonment based on his record and based on the fact that if a fine was given, it’s my understanding he doesn’t pay his fines either ... he currently has 22 outstanding fine suspensions in WA alone."" Sergeant Lee said the state was concerned Mr David could return to Victoria, where he was raised, if he was bailed, and would be unable to return due to WA's hard border closure. Magistrate De Vries denied Mr David bail, stating he had a lengthy record in Victoria of not complying with court orders. He will remain in isolation at Hakea, where he is confined to his cell all day, apart from time to shower and make a phone call. His next court appearance will be in person on Tuesday next week after police confirmed it was safe for him to attend court. Mr Chin indicated Mr David would plead guilty to the charges, which alleged on April 4 and 5 he twice snuck out of the Travelodge Hotel in Perth. Mr David allegedly told police, who were waiting for him in his room on April 4, he had left for a personal matter. The following morning, when he was allegedly caught returning again, he told police he had caught the train to visit his girlfriend in Armadale. The maximum penalty for failing to comply with a directive is a $50,000 fine or 12 months imprisonment. Heather McNeill is the crime and courts editor at WAtoday.
