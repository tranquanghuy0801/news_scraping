Georgia Leathart and Matt Cranley are keeping the romance alive in isolation. Credit:James Brickwood The Sydney couple, in their late 20s, is determined to not let their weekly date nights be lost. Among their plans have been a night with food ordered from different restaurants before going on a virtual tour of a Russian museum. The rules: ditch the activewear and dress up. It's a similar story for Fay and Bruce Stratford, who thankfully cancelled their trip aboard the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise and instead celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary at home. They had a local restaurant deliver a three-course meal, during which Fay got a surprise. “I set the table with a tablecloth, lit the candles, set up the flowers, poured the wine. Then [Bruce] presented a beautiful ring,” she says. Relationship expert Dr Nikki Goldstein says it’s important to create time for your partner and do something special. Here are some ideas to get creative on date night during isolation. Make a thing out of movie night: Goldstein suggests making movie night special by making your own popcorn and setting up your own makeshift bed in the living room. Set up pop-up restaurants around your home: Have a candlelit bath dinner, set up a restaurant on your balcony or outdoor area, lay out a picnic on the living room floor. Make the most of your spaces and chuck on your favourite music. Dress up and make an effort: You might be in your own house all day and night, but you’ll be surprised how much dressing up can improve your mood. Take off the trackies and remind yourself how well you scrub up. Go old-school: Bring out that puzzle you haven’t touched in ages, or get competitive with a board game like Scrabble. Hold cook-offs: Take turns to surprise each other with a special meal each Friday night. Up the stakes each week and treat each other afterwards. Share a meal: Sync up your food delivery to happen at once, then dine together over a video call as though on a proper date. “You could say, 'this is where I would take us if we were in person',” Goldstein says. Or think you're pretty handy in the kitchen? Follow the same recipe each on video, then tuck in together. Replay   Visit a gallery online: Why not visit Bilbao’s Guggenheim, London’s Natural History Museum or the Musée d’Orsay in Paris all from the comfort of your home? Use a share-screen function and you can view together. Play Pictionary: Zoom has a whiteboard function, so grab a set of words, set a timer and laugh at each other's squiggles.

2,/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/how-to-minimise-risk-of-catching-covid-19-at-the-supermarket-20200401-p54g15.html,How to minimise risk of catching COVID-19 at the supermarket,"Grocery shopping is the number one reasonable excuse for leaving home right now and minimising our risk of infection when we shop is fairly straightforward, according to UNSW Professor Mary-Louise McLaws. If we use hand hygiene stations as we enter and exit shops, practise social distancing and refrain from chatting in line, there is no need to take more extreme measures, says McLaws, an infection control expert and World Health Organisation adviser. Give others plenty of space when they're leaving the shop, leave children at home or outside if possible while shopping and avoid talking to others while we queue.Credit:iStock Though COVID-19 virus can live on hard surfaces and particularly on metal for a few days, it needs “the most perfect conditions in the laboratory”, McLaws says. If we are diligent about our own hand hygiene, she says there should be no need to wear gloves or to wipe down trolleys or our steering wheel when we return to the car – even if others aren't as careful as you might be. She says gloves can “give you a false sense of security and you may well place the glove to your face anyway.” Replay   “Just have hygiene on entry and exit of the shop.” If hand sanitisers are not available, McLaws suggests using your own wipes that are “at least 70 per cent ethanol”. She would like to see shops regularly cleaning their trolleys, but more for the sake of social messaging. “Its a visual message to the shoppers that ‘we’re taking our cleaning seriously and if you take your hand hygiene seriously then we’re all in this together’,” McLaws says. Food has not been tested to see how long the virus lives on it for, but McLaws says it is “unlikely” it would exist on food in numbers high enough to cause an infection. “However in practice, I would advise the community to wash their food before putting it in the fridge or before they start preparing it for their meal – just with water.” It's a similar story with packaged foods. “If anyone is at all anxious then open up the package with clean hands, scoop out the food when you want to use it and clean your hands again after you throw the package away.” And apart from the elderly or those in high-risk groups, there is no need for us to opt for home deliveries. But along with hand hygiene, social distancing remains important in the supermarket. “If we keep our distance and do it properly, it’s pretty simple,” she says. “If you come across someone [who] is not in your family germ bubble, i.e. you’re not living with them, then keep your distance.” This includes giving others plenty of space when they're leaving the shop, leaving children at home or outside if possible while shopping and avoiding talking to others while we queue. “Talking can push enough distance that being too close to somebody can increase the risk of acquiring something like COVID-19,” she says. Provided we follow these steps, McLaws assures there is “very little risk” from catching the virus in the supermarket.

4,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/the-unwelcome-stranger-loving-my-quarantined-daughter-from-a-distance-20200403-p54gyg.html,The unwelcome stranger: loving my quarantined daughter from a distance,"My house is besieged by pushy strangers, jostling on my side path, banging on my screen door. Michelle Griffin's daughter on her 21st birthday. Two of them have pushed their way into the hallway and they’re thrusting legal forms at me. I kick open the door with my foot and start pushing them out, yelling go away, go away, but then I realise there are more of them in the backyard, rattling the bolt on the shed. When I wake up, I am gasping for air, my fists clenched. No, not real. It is maybe 5.30am, not yet light. I hear my daughter get up and pad across the hallway to the toilet, coughing a little. Clearing her throat? Over the hum of the exhaust fan I listen for the wheeze of the bleach bottle, the gush of water over soapy hands. My daughter had arrived home safely, and as far as we know, the stranger — COVID-19 — had not yet made its way inside. She would not let us hug her when she pushed her suitcases through arrivals at Melbourne Airport. “Don’t touch me!” she said, backing away. “They are far too easy going in there.” Back then, not quite three weeks ago, rules had only just been introduced requiring travellers to quarantine at home. It was only four days since she’d decided she would leave her student dorm in a quiet English town, and only three since she’d decided to vary her ticket to get on the plane the next day, rather than wait a week. The customs officials had not given my daughter much information about how to self-isolate, but we’d gone looking and learned quite a lot. We knew we couldn’t sit next to her on the couch and comfort her about the six horrible hours she spent in Heathrow’s agitated, coughing crowds. We had to treat her as if she was already infectious. “Fill the space between you with love,” said someone somewhere in my social media feed. So we did, best we could. We were luckier than some — we had a spare room where boxes could be pushed to the side to make space for a table and a couch, creating two rooms for her to live in, and her own chair in our little courtyard. I’d filled a box with plates and cups and cutlery, another with bathroom products, given her fresh towels and sheets and her own bin, tissues and paracetamol. I’d bought wipes and bleach and gloves but there were no masks to be had. At night we served her dinner on a tray left outside her room. When she was finished, she dropped the plates and cups into a tub I’d filled with hot soapy water and a splash of bleach. The weather was still warm enough to wash her dishes outside, leaving them to dry on an old rack I’d once used for pot plants. The gloves I’d used to clean up after her I washed with soap for 20 seconds as if they were my bare hands and hung them up to dry over the laundry sink I dedicated to disinfecting her traces. When I waved goodbye to her at the beginning of January, the bushfires were raging and I was glad she was going to a cool, damp place. We had to wargame the use of the one bathroom and toilet we all shared. I cut yesterday’s newspaper into squares so anyone who used the loo could spray and wipe it down, crumpling the paper into a lined and lidded bin. I removed all the toothbrushes and razors and creams from the bathroom and took them to the kitchen sink — now dedicated to uninfected surfaces. All the surfaces in the bathroom and kitchen were wiped down with compulsive regularity with diluted bleach. My daughter took her showers in the middle of the night, trying to erase all the surfaces she touched as she backed out of the room, allowing hours before the next person entered the space, wielding disinfectant sprays in gloved hands like talismans. It wasn’t hospital-grade practice and it didn’t feel like family, but we tried. She was disoriented and jetlagged and relieved and scared all at once. It was still a profound relief to have her home. When I waved goodbye to her at the beginning of January, the bushfires were raging and I was glad she was going to a cool, damp place. I never imagined I’d urge her to evacuate the UK, fearful that international flights might dry up and leave her stranded, listening to coughing through the walls of her dorm, or worse, sickening in a strange land. She was disoriented and jetlagged and relieved and scared all at once. I would take a chair into the hallway and ask her to open her door so we could talk. What if I infected the old couple next to me on the plane? she asked. What if I infect you or dad? She said she felt like a leper. One time, as she wept, I threw an old coverlet over her head and gave her a hug. She pushed me away; I was ridiculous. What if she were infectious? One of the many cruelties of this new disease is that it seems to make carers sicker than the first patient through prolonged exposure to the viral load. I would somehow have to look after her while wearing a homemade mask and scrubbing myself down every time. The pantry filled up with paracetamol and cough medicine and Vicks. Replay   For seven days we jumped at symptoms. She told us her temperature every morning. Both of us woke up at separate times with raging sore throats. I slept on the couch one night, worried, but woke up fine. She shut herself in her bedroom when she thought she was ill and would not come out. Luckily, as a returned traveller with a sore throat, she was eligible for a COVID-19 test, taken in the back seat of a car at a local clinic. The results came back surprisingly quickly and they came back negative. Through her door I heard the happy note in her voice as she talked to the clinic and dropped my head into my arms on the kitchen table to exhale. She came out, phone clutched in her hand. ""I can hug you now?"" I asked and she nodded and I clung to her like a drowning woman. A few days later, she’s officially past her 14 days in “the quar”, as she calls it. She’s packing up boxes to move into her boyfriend’s flat five blocks away. He voluntarily went into “the quar” himself for two weeks, staying home alone so that she would know, when she moved in, that he was not infectious. It is a loving gesture that gives her mother, at least, a little comfort that these two will not roam the shops and streets as if coronavirus were no big deal. I’ll still speak to her and see her on the street — from two metres away. And we can still drop round food or things she’s left behind. ""What if she gets sick?"" her father asks, late one night in the dark. And we know, in that instant. If she falls ill, she should come back home and we will look after her. The stranger can finally be welcomed inside. We have rehearsed, we are ready. We will fill the space between us with bleach and masks. But also with love.

6,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/the-one-face-to-face-meeting-you-need-to-have-during-lockdown-20200324-p54dcn.html,The one face-to-face meeting you need to have during lockdown,"Freaking out about the prospect of being stuck at home with kids for weeks or months, while also trying to maintain your job, your relationship and your sanity? Then you need a family meeting. That’s the advice of Kate Christie, time management specialist and author of Me First: The Guilt-free Guide to Prioritising You. The first and only agenda of the meeting, says Christie, is agreeing as a family who is going to do what and when. Family is a team sport, it's time for everyone to step up and pitch in.Credit:iStock “Say, ‘As Mum, these are the four things I'm going to do — I'm going to cook three nights a week, I'm going to do four loads of washing a week, and I'm going to do x and y. If there’s [another parent or partner], they say what they are going to do. And then you say to your kids, ‘what are you going to do?’.” Christie says it’s important that kids who are old enough write down what they are going to do so that they feel they contributed to the development of the plan. If kids aren’t old enough to write then get them to draw pictures of their plan instead. “The worst thing you can do is tell them, here's the calendar that I've set up and everyone has to do it,” says Christie. “They need to feel a sense of ownership in it, because when they do come and complain, which they will, you can say, well guys, we built the calendar together.” Replay   The next step is to draw up a daily routine with batches of time which, depending on the age of your kids, should be between 30 minutes and an hour. “Group like activities together so that you get them done in one solid batch of time,” says Christie. “We work best when we single task rather than multi-task. This applies to kids as well.” Include everything in your plan, not just work. That means write down your morning/getting up routine, exercise, work time, play time, chore time, quiet time and meals. “Plan this with the kids, for example, ‘From 9am to 9.45am, mum is going to be doing work. You need to do an activity on your own’,” says Christie. “Depending on the age of the kids it could be doing some homework, they could be planning their vision board, they could be online researching their trip around Australia, they could be doing art and craft.” Christie recommends timing each block with a wind-up timer, like the one on your oven. Stay away from alarms on your computer or phone because that’s likely to lead to distractions. “When you batch your day, everyone knows what's on the agenda that you've all agreed to. And for those 45-minute bursts where you actually have to get some work done you've already pre-planned what the kids are going to do,” says Christie. “If the kids come and annoy you, say, 'Come on, we agreed to this batch, but as soon as the alarm goes off we're having hot chocolate'.” Don’t forget to add in some “me first” time in your schedule, such as a run or walk on your own, a bath, or reading a book in your bedroom. During this time you can get your kids to also read a book, or colour in, or just plonk them in front of the TV for an hour. Once you’ve planned out – and everyone has agreed to – the family schedule, leave it in the kitchen to keep everyone accountable. “You may have to say, ‘who's on dishwasher today?’, but that's okay because I'd rather you be the person who reminds rather than the person who does.” If this whole family schedule thing is starting to sound too much like boot camp, don’t worry, there is still room for spontaneity and going with the flow. “Some days your kids are going to find an activity, and they are going to have laser focus on it, and for whatever reason they get into it. You have to be ready for that. On those days for God's sake leave them to it and have your to-do lists ready to go, so that you can work systematically through things for those miraculous times when the kids are self-sufficient."" But let’s be honest, that’s the best-case scenario. Other days are going to be all over the shop. If you do hit some hurdles, Christie’s advice is to lower your expectations. “I would be aiming for two really good solid 45-minute batches of work per day,” says Christie. “There are going to be times when you're going crazy and they're going crazy, but if you set up enough structure and try to stick to it at least 50 per cent of the time, that is better than just freewheeling 100 per cent of the time.” Me First: The Guilt Free Guide to Prioritising You by Kate Christie (Wiley) is available now.

The first and only agenda of the meeting, says Christie, is agreeing as a family who is going to do what and when. Family is a team sport, it's time for everyone to step up and pitch in.Credit:iStock “Say, ‘As Mum, these are the four things I'm going to do — I'm going to cook three nights a week, I'm going to do four loads of washing a week, and I'm going to do x and y. If there’s [another parent or partner], they say what they are going to do. And then you say to your kids, ‘what are you going to do?’.” Christie says it’s important that kids who are old enough write down what they are going to do so that they feel they contributed to the development of the plan. If kids aren’t old enough to write then get them to draw pictures of their plan instead. “The worst thing you can do is tell them, here's the calendar that I've set up and everyone has to do it,” says Christie. “They need to feel a sense of ownership in it, because when they do come and complain, which they will, you can say, well guys, we built the calendar together.” Replay   The next step is to draw up a daily routine with batches of time which, depending on the age of your kids, should be between 30 minutes and an hour. “Group like activities together so that you get them done in one solid batch of time,” says Christie. “We work best when we single task rather than multi-task. This applies to kids as well.” Include everything in your plan, not just work. That means write down your morning/getting up routine, exercise, work time, play time, chore time, quiet time and meals. “Plan this with the kids, for example, ‘From 9am to 9.45am, mum is going to be doing work. You need to do an activity on your own’,” says Christie. “Depending on the age of the kids it could be doing some homework, they could be planning their vision board, they could be online researching their trip around Australia, they could be doing art and craft.” Christie recommends timing each block with a wind-up timer, like the one on your oven. Stay away from alarms on your computer or phone because that’s likely to lead to distractions. “When you batch your day, everyone knows what's on the agenda that you've all agreed to. And for those 45-minute bursts where you actually have to get some work done you've already pre-planned what the kids are going to do,” says Christie. “If the kids come and annoy you, say, 'Come on, we agreed to this batch, but as soon as the alarm goes off we're having hot chocolate'.” Don’t forget to add in some “me first” time in your schedule, such as a run or walk on your own, a bath, or reading a book in your bedroom. During this time you can get your kids to also read a book, or colour in, or just plonk them in front of the TV for an hour. Once you’ve planned out – and everyone has agreed to – the family schedule, leave it in the kitchen to keep everyone accountable. “You may have to say, ‘who's on dishwasher today?’, but that's okay because I'd rather you be the person who reminds rather than the person who does.” If this whole family schedule thing is starting to sound too much like boot camp, don’t worry, there is still room for spontaneity and going with the flow. “Some days your kids are going to find an activity, and they are going to have laser focus on it, and for whatever reason they get into it. You have to be ready for that. On those days for God's sake leave them to it and have your to-do lists ready to go, so that you can work systematically through things for those miraculous times when the kids are self-sufficient."" But let’s be honest, that’s the best-case scenario. Other days are going to be all over the shop. If you do hit some hurdles, Christie’s advice is to lower your expectations. “I would be aiming for two really good solid 45-minute batches of work per day,” says Christie. “There are going to be times when you're going crazy and they're going crazy, but if you set up enough structure and try to stick to it at least 50 per cent of the time, that is better than just freewheeling 100 per cent of the time.” Me First: The Guilt Free Guide to Prioritising You by Kate Christie (Wiley) is available now.

10,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/lessons-from-a-mother-who-tried-to-win-at-isolation-parenting-20200407-p54hql.html,Lessons from a mother who tried to 'win' at isolation parenting,"It all started with a hand-painted post box. Jamila's four-year-old son painting his ‘kids-only’ post box. Along with kids all over the country, coronavirus means my four-year-old, who doesn't have siblings, can’t hang out with his buddies anymore. We’ve made the decision to pull him out of kinder. Ballet, footy and swimming are cancelled. In an effort to keep things somewhat interesting, I rallied our neighbourhood friends to set up a ‘kids-only’ post box system. Our children could hand-deliver letters, drawings, favourite rocks, flowers and baked goods to one another, in lieu of actual socialisation. We could, of course, have used an old laundry basket or shoe box. That would have done the job just as well. I was, however, desperate for activities that were vaguely more educational than watching another episode of Power Rangers. I also had a clear picture in my head of the crafty, makes-things-out-of-nothing mum I could potentially become during isolation. Enter the hand-painted post box. My son and I sat down with a square wooden box, unnecessarily painting each side white because what true artisan wouldn’t have an undercoat? Then I made my put-upon child paint a second white coat, trying his four-year-old patience to the absolute limits. When I suggested one side could be a portrait of our family, I got a withering stare in response and a painting of the five lions from Voltron. The next morning, mother and son were finally ready to paint. I claimed the post box lid for myself while instructing my kid to create whatever he wanted on the sides. My disappointment rose quickly when he chose to paint mostly horrible television shows that I’d prefer he didn’t watch, all characterised by battles and bad guys. When I suggested one side could be a portrait of our family, I got a withering stare in response and a painting of the five lions from Voltron. For my creation, I carefully drew an outline in lead pencil before mixing my colours just-so. The final product. When my son asked if we could swap canvases – so he could add glitter to my artwork – I rejected his request without apology. The painting was really taking shape and I didn’t want it ruined. Dear Reader: At this point I had not realised my own ridiculousness. Once our magnum opus was complete, we set it on the front step to await our first delivery ... But not before I photographed it from multiple angles, with my child’s paintbrush and hand positioned pleasingly, side of shot. I posted the pictures to my Instagram story, and waited for the praise and love-heart-eye emojis to roll on in. Settling down with a cup of coffee and a biscuit, I reflected with pride on the resourcefulness of my isolation parenting efforts. Then things started to get competitive. My mum-friends were pumping out filtered pictures of craft activities, painting, baking, making, reorganised cupboards, freshly planted flower beds, toddler tai chi, pre-teen pilates and whole-house-obstacle course fun. Every parent knows the sinking feeling of a fellow kinder-mum-or-dad posting their child’s magnificent Leonardo da Vinci-worthy  Easter Hat Parade creation. Robbed of the opportunity to take supposedly candid selfies while on glamorous holidays, the totality of social media bragging was being channelled into our kids. Every parent knows the sinking feeling of a fellow kinder-mum-or-dad posting their child’s magnificent Leonardo da Vinci-worthy Easter Hat Parade creation. It’s even worse when said photo serves as your first reminder that it is in fact Easter Hat Parade day and your kid has no Easter hat. There is a fine line between capturing moments of childhood joy and publicly lying to make yourself look good and your friends feel bad. And me? I had ended up on the less than admirable side of the line. Replay   Returning to Instagram, I posted a few short truth-bomb video stories. I described my rapid descent into craft control-freak madness. I reported my continual berating of a four-year-old for not having a sufficient attention span, despite this being a defining character trait of a four-year-old. The activity itself was a genuinely great idea. My son has literally jumped for joy every time he opens his post box and finds a new delivery within. Making or finding things to post to his buddies is giving him purpose. He is gaining a sense of connection and friendship from afar, which should have been the point of the whole project. Somehow though, I lost sight of that in my efforts to impress other people and reassure myself that, maybe, I was doing OK. To say that we’re living in strange times is about as understated as my kid’s glitter-covered post box. We’re all feeling the pressure, the pain, and even the panic of our current reality. I’m more than a little ashamed of trying to ‘win’ at isolation parenting. From now on I’ll be posting craft activity fails, as well as achievements. Because if we’re all in this together, then some social media honesty is the very least we can offer one another.

11,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/it-s-not-a-good-time-to-be-a-celebrity-but-paltrow-isn-t-the-worst-20200401-p54g7y.html,It's not a good time to be a celebrity. But Paltrow isn't the worst,"Gwyneth Paltrow. Promoter of vagina steaming. Lover of soup cleanses. Mother to a daughter named Apple. Creator of ""conscious uncoupling"". And yet, right now, she is nailing social media. Paltrow has managed, amid a global pandemic of which her country is the new epicentre, to communicate in practical and inoffensive ways on her Instagram. In recent weeks, the Oscar winner turned lifestyle mogul has been busy promoting charities and showing her 6.9 million followers the intricacies of her own social distancing methods. Last week, donning a face mask and disposable gloves, Paltrow detailed simply the measures she was taking to self-isolate and urged others to do the same. “My heart goes out to everyone directly affected or simply in fear. We will get through and I bet you our humanity will shine like never before,” she wrote. Her ability to not be elitist at this difficult moment is commendable. But considering her track record (c'mon, who could forget the jade eggs?) it’s also a little unnerving. Even when promoting content on her multi million-dollar website, Goop, she’s managing to make it somehow... not the worst. On Wednesday she and her new husband, film producer Brad Falchuck, did a Zoom Q&A with Paltrow’s marriage counsellor, where they talked about how to put up with your partner in quarantine – an issue couples around the world are now grappling with. It’s a tricky time to be famous. People normally look to celebrities for cues on how to live their best life, not shelter in place. So what happens when these icons of aspiration try to engage with an audience that is suffering? How do these humans we follow online because they are beautiful and rich communicate without coming off as tone-deaf? People normally look to celebrities for cues on how to live their best life, not shelter in place. It’s something Madonna perhaps should have have reflected on before labelling the coronavirus crisis a great equaliser – while wearing thousands of dollars’ worth of jewellery in a bathtub fit for Marie Antoinette. “This isn't the time to take a milk bath while wearing full-make-up and jewellery” says Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a pop culture expert at the University of Melbourne. “Though I suspect Madonna thought she was being philosophical and contributing something. She wasn't.” The popstar has since taken the video down. Even all-star singalongs are now dangerous territory, as Gal Gadot infamously learnt last month. Replay   The Wonder Woman actor shared a video of herself singing John Lennon's Imagine to her camera, along with big names including Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman. Let's just say hearing lyrics about there “being no heaven” wasn't exactly what the doctor ordered. When the USA, the highest populated celebrity country on earth, becomes the new epicentre of the COVID-19 crisis, celebrity singalongs, workouts, and news about the latest body shaping underwear suddenly seem trite. Or more trite. Even the group effort put in by the likes of David Beckham and model Ashley Graham, holding up signs saying who they stay home for, was poorly received, with many followers commenting that lower income and frontline workers simply do not have that luxury. Ultimately, celebrities have to find a way to stay relevant and likeable while the rest of the world is trudging through hell. Something Rosewarne believes is not impossible. “Celebrities have big platforms. They can use them for good – providing health information and fundraising [like Paltrow], or for what they are good at: being entertaining,” she says, adding that in a time of unprecedented fear and suffering, a little bit of humility and self-awareness go a long way. So now is probably not the time for Elle Macpherson to promote her “wellness” powders, for example, even if, as she claims, they boost immunity. “Doing the same kinds of things we're all doing – cooking and eating at home, watching Netflix while wearing a sheet mask – is what makes celebrities seem likeable,” Rosewarne says. Just look at Jennifer Garner, who has, like many of us, had a crack at baking, making memes, exercising at home and promoting charities. “They'll probably never be genuinely relatable to most of us, but watching them bake cakes, wrangling pets and kids, all makes them seem like real people who are in a situation that, in some ways at least, is like our own.” And for those who never pretended to be like us, there is still a way forward. Take Rihanna, who used her platform to promote her British Vogue cover, in which she appears with writing on her face. But this was after she donated $US5 million in aid to countries affected by coronavirus through her Clara Lionel Foundation. It’s a stark contrast to Justin Bieber, leaping from one piece of furniture to the other in his luxury apartment, or Kim Kardashian West, telling us her hair is going to be “so healthy after this quarantined time.” “Not being mean,” wrote one commenter “but thousands are dying! And you’re talking about your hair?” Hundreds echoed this. Perhaps some celebrities can offer us a different purpose at this moment: a place to vent. And then for those who get it right, like Paltrow, there's a well-earned uptick in followers, but also a chance to spread hope.

There are rules which are annoying, it's true, but the better you keep to these rules, the longer we will have access to the great, green outdoors which keep us sane. Maybe sing Beyoncé's Irreplaceable to yourselves. To the left, to the left, every time you run, keep to the left. The people who I observe thinking they own the universe are often those running in gangs. They aren’t the kinds of gang members you normally visualise.Credit:iStock Rob Stokes has made it pretty plain. If you don’t obey the rules about social distancing, he’ll shut the parks. And if you are in a household like mine, where you are sharing with five adults and a baby, that means you won’t ever be able to give anyone space, either physical or mental, for weeks and possibly months. Victoria has already made significant changes to park access. Now Scott Morrison has made it clear. If you want the parks, you need to behave. I tell myself this about 5.30pm each day, when I strap on the pouch and pop in the baby. He’s getting heavier but it’s resistance training as much as anything else. When I started out a few weeks back, I didn’t know what I was resisting. Now I do. Late afternoon, I set out with the baby to give his darling mother a break and to make sure I keep up the walking I need to do to stay healthy. I keep away from everyone. I take a small purple umbrella because the weather has been a little unpredictable lately and I don't want bub getting wet. Now I'm taking it for other reasons. Then I make sure I keep to the left, right at the edge of the path, in order to enact physical distancing. Replay   There’s been a lot said about how Boomers seem to think the rules don’t apply to them. That has not been my experience. The people whom I observe thinking they own the universe are often running in gangs. They aren’t the kinds of gang members you normally visualise. They don’t want to rob you of your possessions but of the bodily space we all need to keep away from coronavirus. They sweat and spray as they run past, which would be fine if they kept their distance but they don’t. They often refuse to run in single file, instead it’s two or three abreast, and they seem lost in their own little worlds. Of course, they’ve been locked out of their usual homes (gyms). I get it’s hard but it’s hard for all of us and we have to learn to share. Also, try single file. Actually, I'm frightened. There. This makes me vulnerable in all the ways. More than just grandma with the baby but a frightened older woman. I've never felt I needed consideration or protection, but now I do. I would have looked admiringly at those who run fast but now I'm scared. The ones running my way can see there’s a baby in the pouch but don’t have the good grace to keep 1.5 metres away and if I kept any further to the left, I’d be in the bay. But it’s the ones coming up behind me that are the scariest. I can hear their pounding Nikes behind me and I try to move over as far as I can, turning my face away. You’d think these gestures would make it clear to those coming up from behind to take care. No. Two or three times in the past 10 days, young men have bumped me. I can’t tell whether it’s deliberate or not. If it’s deliberate, is it a kind of territory-owning behaviour? Or is it just lack of understanding about what these new rules mean? In any case, just one has muttered ""sorry"" after physical contact. I stop, whip out the alcohol wipes and rub down. (These are sentences I thought I would never write.) On Saturday, I took matters into my own hands. When I hear those loud footsteps, I now know exactly what resistance means. I’m resisting those who do not recognise the needs of the more vulnerable. I stiffen my outstretched arm to my right. In my grasp is a small object I’ve carried with me for weeks. It works as a detour signal. I have a closed purple umbrella and I’m not afraid to use it. I haven’t been troubled since, at least not by runners. Just troubled by our lives right now.

13,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/sex-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-all-your-questions-answered-20200401-p54fvs.html,Sex in the time of coronavirus: All your questions answered,"These are not sexy times. As an obstetrician and gynaecologist in the San Francisco Bay Area, I've been caring for my patients via telemedicine for the past three weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. When I ask patients about new sex partners — a standard question for me — the answer is a universal ""no."" They are taking California's shelter-in-place very seriously. Sex with your household sex partner, providing the partner is well and not in quarantine, is the safest approach.Credit:iStock In fact, many of my patients are more interested in updates about the virus than the medical (and often sexual) problem for which they were referred. The pandemic has most of the world practicing exceptional hand hygiene and social distancing. There are many things we don't know about the virus and while fresh information is coming at an incredible pace, one medical recommendation has remained constant: the need for social distancing. This time has been an exercise in prioritising needs from wants. So where does sex fall on that spectrum? Q: Are we even wanting sex these days? A: It's hard to know yet. While some people may turn to sex for comfort or as a temporary distraction, these are unprecedented times and we don't have much data. Depression and anxiety have a negative effect on libido. Some people are out of work, too, and unemployment can affect sexual desire. The kind of worry people are experiencing crosses so many domains: job security, health, friends' and family's health, retirement and the ability to have access to medical care, to name a few. One study that looked at the effect of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on the reproductive health of married women found sexual activity decreased significantly, and not just in the week after the earthquake. Before the earthquake, 67 per cent of married women reported they were having sex two or more times a week. One week after the earthquake, that number fell to 4 per cent. By four weeks, only 24 per cent reported they were having sex two or more times a week, well below the baseline. While this study is retrospective data — women were asked to recall their sexual activity eight weeks after the earthquake — and an earthquake isn't the same thing as a pandemic, it seems unlikely that sexual activity overall will increase. However, trauma — and these are certainly traumatic times for some — can also lead to sexual risk taking, like unprotected sex or sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Q: What is considered 'safe sex' right now? A: Your risk for infection with the coronavirus starts as soon as someone gets within 1.5 metres of you. (And of course, if you do have sex, your risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases remains the same, and the previous definition of ""safe sex"" still applies.) You've read this elsewhere: COVID-19 is transmitted by droplet nuclei, tiny specks of infectious material far too small to see. They are sprayed from the nose and mouth by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. A person contracts the virus sharing the same airspace — a 1.5-metre radius, the distance droplet nuclei are believed to travel (although with coughing they may travel farther) — and inhaling the infectious particles. Or the droplet nuclei land on an object or surface, making it infectious. Touch that surface and then your face and the chain of transmission is complete. If you do have sex with someone who is infected with the coronavirus, there is nothing we can recommend, be it showering head to toe with soap before and immediately after sex, or using condoms, to reduce your risk of infection. (The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued these guidelines.) We don't know if the coronavirus is present in vaginal secretions or ejaculate, but it has been identified in stool. Based on what we currently know about transmission of the coronavirus, penetrative vaginal or anal sex or oral sex seem unlikely to pose a significant risk of transmission. Q: Who are the safest partners? A: It's best to limit sex to your household sex partner (HSP), who should also be following recommendations for hand hygiene and social distancing. The World Health Organisation currently lists the risk of household transmission as 3 per cent to 10 per cent, but this is based on preliminary data. We don't know what role kissing or sexual activity plays in transmission. If someone you meet online is encouraging you to meet in person? That not only tells you how they view their own safety, but, even more important, how they view yours. The idea of limiting sexual contact to your household partner and social distancing in general is about ending the chain of transmission to your household should one person become infected. If your HSP is sick with symptoms of COVID-19, or has been exposed, definitely don't have sex. They may be too fatigued anyway, but your risk of being infected will likely go up in close, intimate contact. Sleep in separate bedrooms if possible. If you have more than one bathroom, designate one for the sick or exposed person. Try to stay six feet apart and be fastidious about cleaning surfaces. If they were exposed, living as separate as possible in your home for 14 days is recommended. Q: What if I'm in a new relationship and had planned to get other STD testing done? A: Many labs are overwhelmed with coronavirus testing, so you may not get results for some STDs — like gonorrhoea, chlamydia and herpes — as fast as before. Given the short supply of test kits for COVID-19, many medical centres and labs are taking swabs and liquid from other test kits to jury-rig testing kits for the coronavirus, so sampling kits for genital infections may be in short supply. Ask your health provider because workflows may vary locally and may change day to day. But if you are at risk of an STD, you should still seek out a test as soon as possible. Q: What if I don't have an HSP? Am I now celibate? A: Yes, I'm sorry to say, those are the recommendations. For now. But this doesn't mean you can't meet people online — start talking on the phone, have video chats, sext or have phone sex if that's your thing. And if someone you meet online is encouraging you to meet in person? That not only tells you how they view their own safety, but, even more important, how they view yours. Q: What about a 'COVID sex buddy'? A: I've heard people talk about this: a sexual partner who agrees to socially distance with everyone else, but the two of you will hook up for mutual release. I really discourage this (for now). Social distancing means limiting contact with people outside of your household. Each additional person added to the household increases risk. And of course, you are depending on this person to be as vigilant with social distancing as you are — not to mention the risk during transportation between your home and your partner's. At the moment, the risk is too high. Might we see people in close proximity hooking up who both tested positive for COVID-19 and are now 14 days postpositive test? It would not surprise me. However, we don't know much about immunity (protection from reinfection) against COVID-19 after an infection. And some people have presumptive infections but aren't being tested. With seasonal coronaviruses that cause a common cold, immunity lasts about a year, while with the more serious coronaviruses like SARS or MERS, immunity seems to last longer. But we still don't know enough to make concrete recommendations in terms of post-illness behaviour. Q: What about sex toys? A: Sex toys aren't likely to be a method of coronavirus transmission if you have been using them alone. However, if you shared your toys within the past 72 hours, make sure they are appropriately cleaned and wash your hands afterward as the virus may stay active of some surfaces for up to three days. And do not clean sex toys with hand sanitiser or use hand sanitiser immediately before masturbating, because it can be very irritating to the vagina or rectum. Ouch. Q: Is it safe to buy new sex toys? A: Judging from the state of my inbox, it appears that a lot of vibrators are on sale. Is this a good time to take advantage of a deal and the extra time on your hands? Paying electronically is safer than an in-store purchase: Paying online means no one is physically handling a credit card or cash. As for the delivery itself, there is lab data suggesting the coronavirus is viable up to 24 hours on cardboard. Washing your hands after opening and throwing away the delivery box seems like an appropriate mitigation strategy. Letting that box sit for a day (if possible) before opening may be a good idea, although we don't know how the lab data of the virus survival on surfaces translates to the real world. The more everyone commits to social distancing, the faster we can all get back — and down — to business. Does your online purchase of a non-essential (as much as it pains me to say this, a vibrator is a ""want,"" not a ""need"") put someone else at increased risk? Workers at large warehouses where social distancing isn't possible may be at increased risk, especially if they don't have sick leave, so taking time off if exposed isn't possible. One option is to consider a local small business that can take your payment over the phone or online and arrange a curb side pickup. Q: What will safe sex look like in the future? A: Right now the only safe sex is no sex with partners outside your household. If you or your HSP are at high risk, should you take extra precautions to further reduce the risk of transmission — giving up sex and kissing, sleeping in separate bedrooms — in case one of you has an asymptomatic infection? Asking your doctor for guidance here is probably wise. But what about when we emerge from our homes again — which may be some months away — and start thinking about in-person dating, and even mating? No one knows if we are all going to have the urge to have sex after this quasi-hibernation. One concern is a potential surge in risk-taking and STDs. in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. (After all, you can't assume that if someone was celibate during the pandemic they don't have an STD; most STDs don't cause symptoms and could have pre-dated the coronavirus.) If that all sounds fairly bleak, well, it is. For now, the coronavirus probably means less partner sex overall, whether that's because of the lack of a household sex partner for some or a drop in desire for others. Or both. Hopefully, though, this is just for now. Because the more everyone commits to social distancing, the faster we can all get back — and down — to business.

14,/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/sex-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-all-your-questions-answered-20200401-p54fvs.html,Sex in the time of coronavirus: All your questions answered,"These are not sexy times. As an obstetrician and gynaecologist in the San Francisco Bay Area, I've been caring for my patients via telemedicine for the past three weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. When I ask patients about new sex partners — a standard question for me — the answer is a universal ""no."" They are taking California's shelter-in-place very seriously. Sex with your household sex partner, providing the partner is well and not in quarantine, is the safest approach.Credit:iStock In fact, many of my patients are more interested in updates about the virus than the medical (and often sexual) problem for which they were referred. The pandemic has most of the world practicing exceptional hand hygiene and social distancing. There are many things we don't know about the virus and while fresh information is coming at an incredible pace, one medical recommendation has remained constant: the need for social distancing. This time has been an exercise in prioritising needs from wants. So where does sex fall on that spectrum? Q: Are we even wanting sex these days? A: It's hard to know yet. While some people may turn to sex for comfort or as a temporary distraction, these are unprecedented times and we don't have much data. Depression and anxiety have a negative effect on libido. Some people are out of work, too, and unemployment can affect sexual desire. The kind of worry people are experiencing crosses so many domains: job security, health, friends' and family's health, retirement and the ability to have access to medical care, to name a few. One study that looked at the effect of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China on the reproductive health of married women found sexual activity decreased significantly, and not just in the week after the earthquake. Before the earthquake, 67 per cent of married women reported they were having sex two or more times a week. One week after the earthquake, that number fell to 4 per cent. By four weeks, only 24 per cent reported they were having sex two or more times a week, well below the baseline. While this study is retrospective data — women were asked to recall their sexual activity eight weeks after the earthquake — and an earthquake isn't the same thing as a pandemic, it seems unlikely that sexual activity overall will increase. However, trauma — and these are certainly traumatic times for some — can also lead to sexual risk taking, like unprotected sex or sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Q: What is considered 'safe sex' right now? A: Your risk for infection with the coronavirus starts as soon as someone gets within 1.5 metres of you. (And of course, if you do have sex, your risk for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases remains the same, and the previous definition of ""safe sex"" still applies.) You've read this elsewhere: COVID-19 is transmitted by droplet nuclei, tiny specks of infectious material far too small to see. They are sprayed from the nose and mouth by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. A person contracts the virus sharing the same airspace — a 1.5-metre radius, the distance droplet nuclei are believed to travel (although with coughing they may travel farther) — and inhaling the infectious particles. Or the droplet nuclei land on an object or surface, making it infectious. Touch that surface and then your face and the chain of transmission is complete. If you do have sex with someone who is infected with the coronavirus, there is nothing we can recommend, be it showering head to toe with soap before and immediately after sex, or using condoms, to reduce your risk of infection. (The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued these guidelines.) We don't know if the coronavirus is present in vaginal secretions or ejaculate, but it has been identified in stool. Based on what we currently know about transmission of the coronavirus, penetrative vaginal or anal sex or oral sex seem unlikely to pose a significant risk of transmission. Q: Who are the safest partners? A: It's best to limit sex to your household sex partner (HSP), who should also be following recommendations for hand hygiene and social distancing. The World Health Organisation currently lists the risk of household transmission as 3 per cent to 10 per cent, but this is based on preliminary data. We don't know what role kissing or sexual activity plays in transmission. If someone you meet online is encouraging you to meet in person? That not only tells you how they view their own safety, but, even more important, how they view yours. The idea of limiting sexual contact to your household partner and social distancing in general is about ending the chain of transmission to your household should one person become infected. If your HSP is sick with symptoms of COVID-19, or has been exposed, definitely don't have sex. They may be too fatigued anyway, but your risk of being infected will likely go up in close, intimate contact. Sleep in separate bedrooms if possible. If you have more than one bathroom, designate one for the sick or exposed person. Try to stay six feet apart and be fastidious about cleaning surfaces.

If we use hand hygiene stations as we enter and exit shops, practise social distancing and refrain from chatting in line, there is no need to take more extreme measures, says McLaws, an infection control expert and World Health Organisation adviser. Give others plenty of space when they're leaving the shop, leave children at home or outside if possible while shopping and avoid talking to others while we queue.Credit:iStock Though COVID-19 virus can live on hard surfaces and particularly on metal for a few days, it needs “the most perfect conditions in the laboratory”, McLaws says. If we are diligent about our own hand hygiene, she says there should be no need to wear gloves or to wipe down trolleys or our steering wheel when we return to the car – even if others aren't as careful as you might be. She says gloves can “give you a false sense of security and you may well place the glove to your face anyway.” Replay   “Just have hygiene on entry and exit of the shop.” If hand sanitisers are not available, McLaws suggests using your own wipes that are “at least 70 per cent ethanol”. She would like to see shops regularly cleaning their trolleys, but more for the sake of social messaging. “Its a visual message to the shoppers that ‘we’re taking our cleaning seriously and if you take your hand hygiene seriously then we’re all in this together’,” McLaws says. Food has not been tested to see how long the virus lives on it for, but McLaws says it is “unlikely” it would exist on food in numbers high enough to cause an infection. “However in practice, I would advise the community to wash their food before putting it in the fridge or before they start preparing it for their meal – just with water.” It's a similar story with packaged foods. “If anyone is at all anxious then open up the package with clean hands, scoop out the food when you want to use it and clean your hands again after you throw the package away.” And apart from the elderly or those in high-risk groups, there is no need for us to opt for home deliveries. But along with hand hygiene, social distancing remains important in the supermarket. “If we keep our distance and do it properly, it’s pretty simple,” she says. “If you come across someone [who] is not in your family germ bubble, i.e. you’re not living with them, then keep your distance.” This includes giving others plenty of space when they're leaving the shop, leaving children at home or outside if possible while shopping and avoiding talking to others while we queue. “Talking can push enough distance that being too close to somebody can increase the risk of acquiring something like COVID-19,” she says.

There's nothing like a pandemic to clarify the distinction between wellness and actual health. Our collective health is, most would agree, not so good. But through the logic of wellness branding, this situation can represent not just a loss of lives and livelihoods, but also an opportunity. With the right motivational texts and quasi-medicinal products, well-positioned individuals are empowered to recast their quarantine as a self-actualisation incubator, a chance not just to fend off the virus itself but to achieve their peak physical, mental and spiritual forms. There is something ghastly about these efforts. Even when a pandemic is not raging, the very idea of a person advertising a 14-day fast makes me want to call the police. Yet the wellness evangelists have intuited a real paradox in this moment: As our health care system buckles under the strain of the virus, and citizens are isolated at home, self-care has never felt more urgent. The virus has the power to kill the people it has infected, and to instil stress, grief, loneliness and despair in the people it has not. ""The anxiety is what is most oppressive here,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York said in a recent briefing. Lifestyle brands invite us to regain a sense of control, if only over our nutritional intake, hygienic practices and apartment interiors. Replay   In the past few weeks, it seems as if the entire internet has pivoted to wellness. Actors have transformed into home-cooking instructors; pop stars are leading meditations; fashion bloggers are hawking sponsored lounge wear. Showbiz couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon have rolled out a podcast, Staying In with Emily and Kumail, about adapting to indoor life with the help of a Nintendo Switch. The public is seeking self-care tips from Cuomo's PowerPoint presentations and from a loner who has lived in an abandoned mining town for 50 years. I am doing yoga for the first time ever, ending every day by bowing my head and whispering ""namaste"" to my virtual instructor. These coronavirus self-help guides offer tips on how to maintain mental health and relationships under quarantine. But some wellness practitioners are reaching further. Everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow to Tom Brady is pushing an ""immune support"" supplement, which sure seems to imply immunity from the virus. Kerr was recently publicly shamed for sharing a ""virus protection"" guide from a ""medical medium"" who credits himself as the leader of ""the global celery movement."" And Bacon was dinged for posting an ""immunity"" guide that intermingled hand-washing tips with Moon Juice products like Power Dust and Spirit Dust. With just a feeble tweak of messaging, however, these same influencers have solicited praise for their epidemic response. Moon Juice is running a coronavirus giveaway on its Instagram, shipping off ""immuno packs"" to people who deliver groceries or work in nursing homes; Kerr recently donated a bunch of her brand's ""vitamin C"" face serums to health care workers at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre, then shared grateful posts from nurses on her feed. With a firm command of the woo-woo lexicon, a brand is capable of capitalising on the crisis without saying anything at all. The pièce de résistance of coronavirus branding is perhaps this Moon Juice post from March 24, which offers a cosmic perspective on the situation: ""This New Moon offers us a date with destiny. We are being called to birth new versions of ourselves, as the world morphs around us. Let us burn off resistance and dance with the unknown."" It concluded: ""We are learning just how resilient we are."" The text was followed by a recipe for a blend of hot milk and coffee with a dusting of Cordyceps, a ""bioactive supershroom,"" which Moon Juice claims is ""said to increase drive, stamina, and reduce fatigue."" Wellness content used to merely gesture at some kind of spiritual necessity, but it has now proved itself truly crucial. Moon Juice likes to say that it offers ""self care for communal care,"" and while it is ludicrous to imagine that spooning ground mushroom into one's coffee benefits one's community in any way, in this case it borders on being technically correct. Public health legitimately relies on the efforts of each individual to cope in isolation, and if it helps to lace a beverage with mushroom powder, then great. The optimism of this content borders on the delusional, but we have been told to keep our spirits up. Wellness may be fundamentally self-absorptive, but we can be forgiven for gazing at our own navels when there's not much else for us to look at. Still, there is something disquieting about the slick translation of the crisis into the logic of branding. When a fleet of lifestyle bloggers turned a public health warning into a synergistic exercise — they each held up a sign in flowery influencer script, collectively informing their audiences to ""Stay home for the people you love. Be kind! Wash your hands. Let's flatten the curve!""— they probably thought they were using their platforms for good. But they were also helping to reaffirm the reorganisation of community under their various cults of personality. We are living in an upside-down time where the President of the United States is promoting unproven virus cures on television, but Paltrow appeared in a protective mask on Instagram more than a month before the CDC recommended that everyone put them on.

With the right motivational texts and quasi-medicinal products, well-positioned individuals are empowered to recast their quarantine as a self-actualisation incubator, a chance not just to fend off the virus itself but to achieve their peak physical, mental and spiritual forms. There is something ghastly about these efforts. Even when a pandemic is not raging, the very idea of a person advertising a 14-day fast makes me want to call the police. Yet the wellness evangelists have intuited a real paradox in this moment: As our health care system buckles under the strain of the virus, and citizens are isolated at home, self-care has never felt more urgent. The virus has the power to kill the people it has infected, and to instil stress, grief, loneliness and despair in the people it has not. ""The anxiety is what is most oppressive here,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York said in a recent briefing. Lifestyle brands invite us to regain a sense of control, if only over our nutritional intake, hygienic practices and apartment interiors. Replay   In the past few weeks, it seems as if the entire internet has pivoted to wellness. Actors have transformed into home-cooking instructors; pop stars are leading meditations; fashion bloggers are hawking sponsored lounge wear. Showbiz couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon have rolled out a podcast, Staying In with Emily and Kumail, about adapting to indoor life with the help of a Nintendo Switch. The public is seeking self-care tips from Cuomo's PowerPoint presentations and from a loner who has lived in an abandoned mining town for 50 years. I am doing yoga for the first time ever, ending every day by bowing my head and whispering ""namaste"" to my virtual instructor. These coronavirus self-help guides offer tips on how to maintain mental health and relationships under quarantine. But some wellness practitioners are reaching further. Everyone from Gwyneth Paltrow to Tom Brady is pushing an ""immune support"" supplement, which sure seems to imply immunity from the virus. Kerr was recently publicly shamed for sharing a ""virus protection"" guide from a ""medical medium"" who credits himself as the leader of ""the global celery movement."" And Bacon was dinged for posting an ""immunity"" guide that intermingled hand-washing tips with Moon Juice products like Power Dust and Spirit Dust. With just a feeble tweak of messaging, however, these same influencers have solicited praise for their epidemic response. Moon Juice is running a coronavirus giveaway on its Instagram, shipping off ""immuno packs"" to people who deliver groceries or work in nursing homes; Kerr recently donated a bunch of her brand's ""vitamin C"" face serums to health care workers at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre, then shared grateful posts from nurses on her feed. With a firm command of the woo-woo lexicon, a brand is capable of capitalising on the crisis without saying anything at all. The pièce de résistance of coronavirus branding is perhaps this Moon Juice post from March 24, which offers a cosmic perspective on the situation: ""This New Moon offers us a date with destiny. We are being called to birth new versions of ourselves, as the world morphs around us. Let us burn off resistance and dance with the unknown."" It concluded: ""We are learning just how resilient we are."" The text was followed by a recipe for a blend of hot milk and coffee with a dusting of Cordyceps, a ""bioactive supershroom,"" which Moon Juice claims is ""said to increase drive, stamina, and reduce fatigue."" Wellness content used to merely gesture at some kind of spiritual necessity, but it has now proved itself truly crucial. Moon Juice likes to say that it offers ""self care for communal care,"" and while it is ludicrous to imagine that spooning ground mushroom into one's coffee benefits one's community in any way, in this case it borders on being technically correct. Public health legitimately relies on the efforts of each individual to cope in isolation, and if it helps to lace a beverage with mushroom powder, then great. The optimism of this content borders on the delusional, but we have been told to keep our spirits up. Wellness may be fundamentally self-absorptive, but we can be forgiven for gazing at our own navels when there's not much else for us to look at. Still, there is something disquieting about the slick translation of the crisis into the logic of branding. When a fleet of lifestyle bloggers turned a public health warning into a synergistic exercise — they each held up a sign in flowery influencer script, collectively informing their audiences to ""Stay home for the people you love. Be kind! Wash your hands. Let's flatten the curve!""— they probably thought they were using their platforms for good. But they were also helping to reaffirm the reorganisation of community under their various cults of personality. We are living in an upside-down time where the President of the United States is promoting unproven virus cures on television, but Paltrow appeared in a protective mask on Instagram more than a month before the CDC recommended that everyone put them on. Health may be scarce, but wellness is still in stock.

The 5:2 diet creator has some advice,"The physician who made intermittent fasting famous and created the popular 5:2 diet has turned his attention to the something we are all craving during the COVID-19 crisis: a good night's sleep. Dr Michael Mosley, a self-proclaimed human guinea pig, is in self-isolation in London as two of his sons are suspected of having coronavirus, and his new book, Fast Asleep, has come at a “strangely relevant” time. Tackling the secrets of sleep: Michael Mosley. Sleep is “really, really, really important” for our immune system, he says, helping us minimise the chances of becoming ill and to fight infection. “When you’re in deep sleep your body produces these things called cytokines [a type of protein] and it also produces antibodies and T-killer cells, all of which are important to the immune system,” Mosley says. Mosley doesn’t claim a good night’s sleep can protect people from COVID-19, but says it “will improve your chances” of not becoming ill. Research backs this. A 2015 study took 164 healthy volunteers and infected them with the common cold virus. Those who slept less than six hours a night were four times more likely to develop a cold than those who slept for seven hours or more. Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying. Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald's newsletter here and The Age's here. And the benefit to the immune system is just one reason why quality shut-eye is important. Mosley says good sleep also washes away the daily build-up of “toxic waste” in our brain tissue, it helps us consolidate memory, it helps us process emotions, it helps to improve our mood and it helps to regulate our hormones and sex drive.  One way to help us get good sleep is to stick to a healthy diet, Mosley says. A 2016 study found that a diet rich in fibre and protein was linked to deeper sleep. While a separate study found that those who ate a Mediterranean-style diet, rich in healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, legumes and wholegrains, slept better than those who ate a western-style diet. Leaving a few hours between dinner and bedtime, regularly exercising, practising mindfulness and adopting time-restricted eating can also help. Replay   For those still struggling to sleep, Mosley says it can be helpful to remember we have “a huge range of different sleep needs” and it is natural to wake in the night. If he finds himself waking now, he accepts it and sometimes gets up to read or listen to gentle music. “It’s not so much the hours you spend in bed as your sleep efficiency from having deep sleep that matters,” says Mosley, explaining that getting up and waiting until your sleep drive increases is healthier than lying in bed feeling stressed about not sleeping. Right now, with our normal routines affected by COVID-19, it's a particularly important time to maintain discipline around our sleep and health. “There is the real risk of the virus [itself] and there is a significant risk to mental health... sleep will help support [that],” Mosley says. “You need to eat well, you need to sleep well, you need to exercise and you need to manage your stress levels. All these things interact. They all support each other.” Sarah Berry is a lifestyle and health writer at The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Copyright © 2020", Sarah Berry ,"April 6, 2020"

We fear contracting the coronavirus. We fear people we love getting it. We fear that person walking towards us on the street might have it so we steer well clear of them. Given that we see ourselves as social beings, having fearfulness influencing so much of our behaviour is utterly dire. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Illustration: Jim PavlidisCredit:  But it can work for us, too. Fear has enabled humanity to survive and develop. It’s proven throughout history to be the most powerful motivator of all. One of the positives of fear is that it can force you to discipline your mind and sort out your priorities. In other words, to wake up to yourself. Several years ago, one of my children developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She had just turned six and was in her first year of school. Because the doctors couldn’t get her into remission inside the first fortnight of treatment, she had to undergo an extended and quite heavy chemotherapy regime that lasted 28 months. Of course, it was gruelling for her, and despite our family going into a long form of self-isolation through that time, she still managed to pick up a range of infections along the way, including pneumonia and glandular fever. Happily, she’s reached adulthood and is enjoying life as a university student. She was the one who defeated cancer; I was just a bystander. But what I remember most of all from that period is the overwhelming fear I felt that it would turn out badly, and how that fear and sustained sense of shock changed me in ways big and small. Behind the wheel, suddenly I couldn’t get angry at other motorists. Who cared if I got cut off? A colleague got a pay rise and I didn’t? I had bigger things to worry about. My tolerance for bulldust moved to zero. I started to value my time more and did whatever I could to stop others from wasting it. I realised at an embarrassingly late stage in my life that friendships were investments, and I should be more attentive. I decided to head off in a new professional direction. So much of what had seemed important to me turned out to be not very important at all. How will we use our time as we wait for the scientists to develop a vaccine that will let us walk amongst each other in the daylight once again? In no way do I suggest that I’ve become a better person. But more than a decade on, I do have a clearer sense of my own direction. Fear was my motivator. As we make our way through this historic communal experience of fear, I wonder if it might not prompt a similar sort of reboot to the national project we call Australia. We’re suffering a succession of shocks: the disease first and the recession second. The second seems all the more confronting because our economy has been in the black for almost 30 years – our longest period of growth. We wasted far too much of our prosperity that followed the 1990s recession. We blithely rid ourselves of our advanced manufacturing capabilities, queried the value of research and development and hitched our economy to a model in which immigration and rising property and commodity prices would drive growth. We don’t even have secure fuel reserves. Australian politics hit a dead end at last year's election. We re-elected a government that proudly promised not to do much at all, just to keep things ticking along, and if there were multibillion-dollar tax rorts that kept pushing up house prices, that was all tickety-boo. The government straddled the fence on climate change, paying lip service to tackling it while giving comfort to those in its ranks who took a scorched-earth, anti-science stance on the same subject. Meanwhile, the opposition got all the way to the election campaign without being able to answer a simple question: what would its climate change policy cost? It then further insulted Australians by responding that it was a silly question. Now the opposition has a new leader whose modus operandi seems to be to find as many ways as possible not to have serious policy disagreements with the government. Over the summer, or at least the part of it that included the bushfires if you can remember that far back, things seemed to get even worse. Stasis had set in. But COVID-19 has come along and not just mugged us but taken us hostage. During our time of sequestration, how will we use our time as we wait for the scientists to develop a vaccine that will let us walk among each other in the daylight once again? I’m hoping that once we get past the novelty of being stuck inside for what could be a very long time, we’ll take another look at where we’ve got ourselves and think about the things that really count. Economically, it’s going to be hard going for so many of us. We do have it within us to reimagine and create a better society, with more accountable and more audacious politics on both sides. Australians have done it before. Federation happened after the Australian colonies suffered the depression of the 1890s, and the young nation became a great social experiment, extending the franchise to women, enshrining the living wage and much more.

And it will no doubt continue to balloon further for the remainder of what has now been rebranded ""International Women's Month"", with every social media post and email newsletter cementing my sense of self-worth - and a renewed gush of praise and celebration expected on Mothering Sunday. What have I done to deserve all this praise and celebration? I was born female. And I don't want to play down the importance of either my sex or the March 8 date, officially recognised as International Women's Day in 1977 by the United Nations. Let's not forget that it was on that day in 1917 that members of the women's movement in Russia decided to peacefully protest against the war, and exactly a year later that women across Europe held rallies in solidarity. Following the Second World War, countries from all continents began using March 8 as a marker for advocating women's rights, and in the '70s hundreds of women marched for abortion rights and workplace equality across the US. I say ""let's not forget"", because we are starting to, aren't we? Drunk on empty hashtagged empowerment, we're bastardising a concept that needs to be kept lofty, altruistic and focused on one simple and unsexy message: men need to stop killing, raping, maiming and harassing women. Also, we'd like equal rights and pay, please. But that message has been buried by the craven consumers bombarding my inbox with implorations to ""empower women's individuality through style"", ""make your shopping count"", and ""help women to support women"" by clicking ""buy now"" on that super wide-leg jumpsuit, as well as ""a selection of girly products perfect for your little ones from flowery Dolce & Gabbana dresses and Monnalisa accessories to Gucci belt bags"". They're reducing women's rights to a marketing ploy. And yes, I'm sure that a percentage of the ""proceeds from the Empower Her collection"" being flogged by a sporting goods company will benefit a foundation supporting ""girls' running programmes"", just as I'm sure that the homeware brand peddling ""Bhutan Cloud Pillows"" are supporting ""empowered female artisans in Mombasa""... but more than anything these gruesome bandwagon-jumpers are using feminism to line their own coffers. They're reducing women's rights to a marketing ploy. It's not just companies revelling in such Hallmark-hollow branding exercises, but individuals. Because in our social media age we're all brands. Which is why women hawking their latest projects (and themselves) on Twitter and Instagram have eagerly appropriated #HeForShe and #WeRiseByLiftingOthers, presumably because the honest versions of those hashtags - #MeForMe and #IRiseByPretendingToLiftOthers - wouldn't be so well received. Then there are the men. Oh, there's a special place in hell for men using a platform for female equality to further their own ends. Take the Father of Daughters blogger and Instagrammer, Simon Hooper, who decided to make a State of the Union-like Instagram address to ""all the incredible women that have been there to guide me"", and ""encourage and empower"" them ""to achieve their goals and be what they want to be"" - before shamelessly plugging the insurance firm sponsoring him. Even Sadiq Khan, London's Mayor, who I like, went a bit too far with the IWD virtue-signalling, tweeting: ""Believe women. Respect women. Promote women. Trust women."" What, all women? Because when any concentrated concept or campaign becomes an amorphous love-in, this is the problem we run into. Women are not all honest or trustworthy, and they certainly shouldn't be promoted above men simply by virtue of their sex. They are not a uniquely superlative breed or a non-competitive community, deserving of celebration and flowers for the rest of ""International Women's Month"", but individuals who are themselves capable of evil and misogyny - yet nevertheless deserve to feel safe and have equal rights.

Annabelle Williams is a former Paralympian who now works as an international speaker educating companies on the importance of gender diversity.Credit:James Brickwood But she did wind up back in the pool, going on to break five world records and win gold for Australia at the 2012 London Paralympics. The 31-year-old, also an Order of Australia recipient, lawyer and TV commentator, still loves to talk. And she is now using her voice to spread the message on gender equality and diversity to audiences globally. This week, to mark International Women’s Day on Sunday, Williams flew from Sydney to Saudi Arabia, to present to hundreds of people at massive petrol and gas company, Saudi Aramco. Saudi Arabia might not seem an obvious fit to celebrate women’s equality, given the country only granted women the right to drive in 2018. And it wasn’t until last year that women were able to apply for a passport without a male guardian’s permission. Williams met several Aramco executives while studying an executive MBA at Stanford University last year, and says the speaking gig comes during a time of change in the Kingdom. “The people I’ve spoken to from the company are really keen to push the needle forward on gender equality and equality in general,” she says. “I also am aware that when I’m speaking to those topics ... it’s usually to diversity inclusion officers or managers, so they’re already big believers. I thought this would be a good opportunity to be involved in an initiative where they are trying to be the drivers of change.” In the past six months, Williams has spoken about diversity and inclusion at companies including Qantas, Citibank and P&O Cruises. [They] are really keen to push the needle forward on gender equality. She believes most Australian companies are taking positive steps toward gender equality. “Having said that, we are still a long way from true equality,” she says. “The gender pay gap is still real. Most workplaces don’t have breastfeeding rooms. Childcare is too expensive.” Williams says society must recognise that gender diversity has wide-ranging benefits, “economically, socially and politically”. Williams was inspired to take to become a speaker after delivering a well-received speech during her six-week executive MBA. Not one to mess about, Williams, mum to 18-month old daughter Josie, completed the course during maternity leave. “I thought I’m going to have a whole year off; I may as well do something productive,” she says. “But when I had her, I thought oh my God. I felt so conflicted. I had to stop breastfeeding the morning I started the executive MBA. “The only reason I could do it was because of the amount of support I had from my husband and my parents, who all came with me.” Prior to that, Williams worked as legal counsel for the Australian Olympic Committee. She’s still vice-president of Paralympics Australia. I felt a need ... to prove to people that one hand wasn't going to be a limitation. While her speaking venture involves plenty of international travel, it also gives her more time with Josie – who she sometimes takes along for the ride. Williams, born without a left hand and forearm, believes having a disability has made her extremely ambitious. “I think I felt a need, particularly when I was young, to prove to people that one hand wasn’t going to be a limitation for me,” she says. That included devising her own approach to everyday tasks, such as using a zipper, plaiting her hair or peeling a potato. “Over time all these little things make you quite determined. You just don’t allow roadblocks to stop you – you sort of bulldoze on through.” After receiving so much support during her life, Williams now wants to give back and inspire others. “If there’s a little girl out there with one arm who feels like maybe she can’t play netball because people will wonder or not whether she can catch the ball, well I was in that position,” she says. And since having her daughter, Williams has another reason to keep fighting the good fight. “If I can help to drive a change so that she grows up in a society where there is more gender equality and more equal rights for everyone, that’s absolutely what I want to do.” Larissa is a reporter and producer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Ham ,"March 8, 2020"

I’m ashamed to admit I’d never heard of Lecki Ord or Winsome McCaughey, our first 2 female Lord Mayors in 1987 and ’88 respectively. Why didn’t I know their names or stories? I invited them to Town Hall to find out more.

Now we are vibrant, exciting, industrious – attracting residents from all over the world. Within the decade we’ll be Australia’s biggest city. Their vision and leadership should be celebrated, but unless we tell their story and mention their names, Lecki Ord and Winsome McCaughey’s legacy is invisible. It is lost. I wondered what other wonderful women were missing from our collective memory. A head count of statues and monuments around the city of Melbourne gives us 23 men. There are only two women, one is Queen Victoria. On Swanston Street alone, we’ve got Matthew Flinders, Burke and Wills, Sir Redmond Barry and a bronze dog named Larry LaTrobe. So where are the women? Did they sit idly chatting about the weather as men built the city? Unfortunately, women have been discounted or erased as city-shaping leaders in our story. Leckie Ord (left) was Melbourne's first female lord mayor. Winsome McCaughey (right) followed straight after. Pictured in 2016 with the Greens' Olivia Ball (centre). Credit:Eddie Jim From the 1850s gold rush, Melbourne was a city of pubs and inns. As historian Professor Clare Wright has unearthed, at least 50 per cent of hotels were owned by or licensed to women. Authorities believed they would run “a more orderly house” and have a calming effect on drunken patrons. It was a golden opportunity to get ahead for widows, deserted wives and working class women without an education. Running a business, in any era, requires grit. Food, beer, wine and lodgings – it was rough and ready but these women created the foundation for Melbourne’s modern hospitality industry. How about a monument, a mural, a painting? These enterprising ladies should be remembered. Another city-shaping Melburnian is Vida Goldstein. Not long after Australia became a nation in 1901, our young country was big news across the world when all adult Australian white women won the right to vote and – more shocking - the right to stand for election. Vida was the driving force behind that hard-won change. She was revered internationally as the leader of the “votes for women” movement and was among the first four women to stand for federal Parliament. She fired up national debate about wage equality, the right to be safe from violence in the home and women taking their place in the political arena. Either Vida was ahead of her time or we’re taking too long to make change. She died in 1949, without recognition. A global sensation in her day, this woman needs her story up in lights. Do we know of Lady Gladys Nicholls, one of our leading Aboriginal activists? From the 1940s to the 1970s, her community work around the inner city, especially caring for young, destitute Aboriginal girls was legendary. Lady Gladys at least has a statue, our only local woman. Arm-in-arm she stands in bronze with her husband in the Parliament Gardens. She was cherished by the community. Our Aboriginal women were not even counted as citizens until 1967. They have faced systemic disadvantage on a crushing scale. Are we a good city for them yet? Where are their stories? Zelda D’Aprano was another change-maker. At 40, Zelda had held a range of jobs where she’d been paid a fraction of her male co-workers’ salary. In every job she’d asked for equal pay and was sacked more than once for her impertinence. In 1969, the Court of Arbitration was hearing an Equal Pay test case brought by Zelda’s employer, the Meatworkers Union. Technically, the case succeeded: the court ruled that equal pay would apply where a woman was doing exactly the same work as a man. It was the hollowest of victories. In the meat industry, as in most industries, there were no or very few women doing exactly the same work as men. Qualified women were relegated to support roles and, infamously, in the public service required to resign upon pregnancy. Zelda, fed up, chained herself to the doors of the Commonwealth Building in protest. She said, “I was convinced that genteel meetings at the city square would never achieve anything. Women would have to fight for what they wanted.” Her radical stand made the news, the union sacked her for being too outspoken and she went on to lead many other protests against bone-headed unfairness. Her gutsy effort deserves recognition.

37,/lifestyle/gender/on-international-women-s-day-a-message-not-many-want-to-hear-20200306-p547hm.html,"On International Women's Day, a message not many want to hear","EDITOR'S NOTE: The High Court overturned Cardinal George Pell's conviction for historic child sex offences in a judgment ruling handed down April 7, 2020. In a unanimous decision all seven High Court judges found Victoria's Court of Appeal should not have upheld Pell's conviction It found the evidence could not support a guilty verdict. So it’s International Women’s Day on Sunday and, like most years, as a feminist who writes a regular social commentary column in this publication, I’ve been asked to speak at various events observing the day. This would normally all be fine. I could repeat the same concerns I’ve been expressing passionately for years - the epidemic of domestic violence, wage inequality, inadequate childcare, male privilege, where to after #metoo … Bettina Arndt has lashed calls for her Order of Australia to be rescinded. Credit:Joshua Morris But this year I proffered a new topic for discussion. And considering the sputtering and choking noises through the phone at its mention, it’s one that women may not want to hear. But here goes anyway because I believe this needs to be said – we are not perfect. Yep, you read right. I am dubious of feminism painting women within the confines of suffragette and saint, no deviation allowed. This continuous narrative of male bad, female good, is too broadstroke. And, if we are really honest, it’s also not helping. Now, that sound you heard is women taking to social media to condemn me for betraying my gender, to insult me for daring to go against the grain of what certain hardliners decree. However, I will cop the abuse for the greater good, even though the backlash, I know from experience, is brutal. Going off-piste today when discussing feminism is to literally wear a bullseye as a third eye. In the past, I have deviated from doctrine, daring to suggest in writing that men can and should refer to themselves as feminists, receiving the nastiest, personal bile as a result, one fellow writer going as far to call me a ""traitorous c---"". So much for that sisterhood. And that was nothing compared to when I opined that certain religious or pro-life women should not be excluded from feminism for their beliefs, that the movement should be accommodating not alienating. Let’s get one thing out of the way here before I continue – I am no Bettina Arndt. In fact, I would say the only thing the self-proclaimed men's rights activist and I have in common is that neither of us has been a registered psychologist. The columnist deserves to be honoured with an Order of Australia about as much as does convicted paedophile George Pell. However, I do believe that there is a middle ground that must be explored and celebrated by women, shades of grey that allow debate and free thought. An argument here to illustrate my point: yes, women do falsely accuse men of domestic assault or harming children in custody cases as post #MeToo investigations have shown. And yes, this is a tiny fraction that I agree gets way too much attention amid the bigger and imperative issue of valid sexual assaults against women. But I will not cop the hard-line feminist argument that this doesn’t happen at all or there is “no evidence” to support such claims, that it's false news perpetuated by the patriarchy. Come on, ladies - we must grip the fact that we, too, can err. One Nation senator Pauline Hanson, whose views I respect about as much as Arndt’s, recently expressed concern that some women were making up domestic violence claims in custody battles, which should be addressed in the Coalition's impending investigation into the family law system. “I am hearing too many cases where parents are using domestic violence to stop the other parent from seeing their children,” she told the ABC. Predictably, Hanson copped a pile-on. And again, I agree that instances of women abusing the system are miniscule in comparison to the epidemic of men abusing and endangering partners and children. However, I refuse to insist they never happen at all to fall in line with what some believe it takes to be a ""true feminist"". I know they happen – albeit rarely – because women are human, too. I also have witnessed such an incident within my own friendship group. However, for the past 18 months, I have also watched as one of my girlfriends has been abused, hounded and defamed by her ex to the point where I have gravely feared for her safety. And the last thing I want to do is re-abuse any victim. What I do want to do is open up a discussion that appears currently closed, one that may help men understand their actions to help stop them. I want change and I don’t see it likely to happen when feminist doctrine is demonising men as unalterable. We need to sometimes step down from the unchallenged higher ground. I believe that a black and white perception that centuries of suppression has made women superior or saintly is not helping. We need to embrace a moderate middle if parity is ever to be achieved. We need to say that, yes, the patriarchy still exists and it's evil. Yes, men must be stopped from abusing and killing women – by any means it takes and NOW! And yes, I will continue to fight with all the passion I can muster to keep women safe - for reproductive rights, pay equity, quotas … I will remain defiantly feminist until the word is rendered redundant, replaced with humanism. But surely the fight for equality – which is and shall always be my feminist goal – shouldn’t mean we repeat history and try to repress another gender or that we have no need for further introspection? Let’s not make this literally tit for tat. How about we proudly celebrate International Women’s Day for what we really are – fierce, fabulous and flawed, too. Wendy Squires is a regular columnist.

38,/lifestyle/gender/on-international-women-s-day-a-message-not-many-want-to-hear-20200306-p547hm.html,"On International Women's Day, a message not many want to hear","EDITOR'S NOTE: The High Court overturned Cardinal George Pell's conviction for historic child sex offences in a judgment ruling handed down April 7, 2020. In a unanimous decision all seven High Court judges found Victoria's Court of Appeal should not have upheld Pell's conviction It found the evidence could not support a guilty verdict. So it’s International Women’s Day on Sunday and, like most years, as a feminist who writes a regular social commentary column in this publication, I’ve been asked to speak at various events observing the day. This would normally all be fine. I could repeat the same concerns I’ve been expressing passionately for years - the epidemic of domestic violence, wage inequality, inadequate childcare, male privilege, where to after #metoo … Bettina Arndt has lashed calls for her Order of Australia to be rescinded. Credit:Joshua Morris But this year I proffered a new topic for discussion. And considering the sputtering and choking noises through the phone at its mention, it’s one that women may not want to hear. But here goes anyway because I believe this needs to be said – we are not perfect. Yep, you read right. I am dubious of feminism painting women within the confines of suffragette and saint, no deviation allowed. This continuous narrative of male bad, female good, is too broadstroke. And, if we are really honest, it’s also not helping. Now, that sound you heard is women taking to social media to condemn me for betraying my gender, to insult me for daring to go against the grain of what certain hardliners decree. However, I will cop the abuse for the greater good, even though the backlash, I know from experience, is brutal. Going off-piste today when discussing feminism is to literally wear a bullseye as a third eye. In the past, I have deviated from doctrine, daring to suggest in writing that men can and should refer to themselves as feminists, receiving the nastiest, personal bile as a result, one fellow writer going as far to call me a ""traitorous c---"". So much for that sisterhood. And that was nothing compared to when I opined that certain religious or pro-life women should not be excluded from feminism for their beliefs, that the movement should be accommodating not alienating. Let’s get one thing out of the way here before I continue – I am no Bettina Arndt. In fact, I would say the only thing the self-proclaimed men's rights activist and I have in common is that neither of us has been a registered psychologist. The columnist deserves to be honoured with an Order of Australia about as much as does convicted paedophile George Pell.
