You’re on the committee!” Replay   No. He didn’t know. Turns out most of the innovation committee, which was formed less than two weeks ago to carefully and thoroughly explore when the premiership can recommence, didn’t know anything about it, either. Yet here ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys was about an hour later, talking exclusively to Nine News, confirming that a May 21 or May 28 restart was imminent. The fact barely anyone on the very committee formed to investigate strategies to restart the competition knew about its own recommendations suggests they are merely puppets. It also suggests they were appointed with a return date and an outcome already determined. Problem was, nobody got around to telling long-time broadcast partner Channel Nine, which pays the NRL $125 million a year to show its matches, about any of this. Nine already had its nose firmly out of joint, angered that it hadn't been given a seat at the Project Apollo table. Sources at Nine — publisher of the Herald — say the media company has become increasingly angered about the way negotiations have played out since the NRL decided to suspend the competition on March 23 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has become increasingly hands-on with those discussions — and he hasn’t liked what he’s seen in the past two weeks. When confidential details from one meeting with NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg and chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo were leaked to the press, it only added to the animosity. Channel Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has taken control of broadcast negotiations with the NRL.Credit:Peter Braig When the Herald broke the story on Wednesday night about the planned May 21 kick-off, it blindsided Nine. It was the final straw. So, at 11am on Thursday, Nine got out the whacking stick — and it whacked hard. A statement released to Nine News and the Herald said the coronavirus pandemic “has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years” and revealed it had “bailed” out the game with a $50m loan in the past, but that “much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. Around the same time, the innovation committee was meeting at League Central, discussing the game’s fabulous early return to the field … Then everyone’s phones start lighting up with messages and phone calls. Nine’s stunning broadside can be interpreted several ways. The immediate thought was that the company wants out of its broadcast deal, a line that’s been pushed by News Corp for weeks and, in some respects, understandably so after Nine announced to the Australian Stock Exchange it would save $130m if the NRL didn’t play another match this year. Indeed, News Corp has done a solid job pushing a particular narrative throughout this crisis, highlighting that Nine didn’t make its quarterly broadcast payment on April 1 … while often neglecting to mention that Fox Sports also didn’t make its payment. The play is understandable: Fox Sports and Kayo rely on subscriptions — and therefore content in the form of matches — to survive. Nine considers the game a “loss leader” — something that is great for its brand and news division despite the heavy costs involved with broadcasting matches. Many inside Nine’s Willoughby bunker are adamant the long-time broadcaster of rugby league doesn’t want to walk away from the game. Relax, they say, we haven’t heard commentator Ray Warren screaming “Papenhuyzen!” or “Sivo!” or any other player's name for the last time. Sunday matches leading into the 6pm news bulletin, the State of Origin monolith and the finals series mean too much to Nine. Rather, the attack on the NRL was seen as purely strategic as Marks plays hardball in renegotiating the broadcast deal. He argues the game is an inferior product if it isn't played before crowds and the season extends into October, November and December. In doing so, though, the statement is an extraordinary smackdown of the NRL’s culture, and in particular Greenberg, who was claiming only days ago talks with Nine had been quite “positive” and “productive”. Meanwhile, V’landys has been rather effusive in his praise of Marks in recent days, telling the Herald earlier this week: “Hugh is a good man. He’s a very good CEO. He’s looking after Channel Nine’s interests …” Marks was approached for comment for this piece but declined. Playing hardball is one thing, but some have seen the play as opportunistic. Nine might broadcast the game, it might pay the NRL handsomely, but it doesn’t own the game. And who is Nine to tell the NRL how to waste its money anyway? Is Project Apollo going to look more like Apollo 11 (which reached the Moon) or Apollo 13 (which didn’t and became a Tom Hanks movie)? After a meeting-a-thon on Thursday, club bosses were left feeling that June 4 was a more realistic start date than May 28, which the NRL announced it is now aiming for. “It was a waste of time,” huffed one chief executive. “We’d read it all in the paper already.” What’s clear is that the idea of players locking down in a “bubble” has been burst. The only thing that really matters now is working out how the NRL can get around border issues with Queensland and New Zealand. You can bet a whole lot of Kiwis on either side of the Tasman will be watching with interest to see if the Warriors get preferential treatment in coming into the country.

Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle is under heavy fire as the embattled code struggles through uncertain times — and, in many respects, she deserves it. It explains the deep level of frustration and pain felt by the many people who still love and care for the game. That said, Castle’s crucifixion for not agreeing to a deal with long-time broadcaster Fox Sports pre-coronavirus is unfair. Sources familiar with negotiations report she was only a week away from stitching up a lucrative deal with Optus, one that was far better than the offer on the table from Fox Sports, which had been bullying her for weeks into agreeing to terms. That’s right: a week. Then the coronavirus went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like infecting nearly 1.5m people across the world. The Rugby Union Players Association might also be at war with Castle but a couple of staffers on the lowest of wages at RA tell this column she exhausted every option in trying to save their jobs. Interim chairman Paul McLean has declared that Castle has “the full support of the board” — never a great sign — but it is unlikely she will be frogmarched anytime soon.

Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk though a long-term plan."" In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfilled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic.

Replay   As revealed by the Herald on Wednesday afternoon, the NRL had two proposals on the table and was set to decide on either a 15-round competition that would see all teams play each other once or a 16-round, two-conference system.

The Queensland government isn’t providing the same freedom as NSW, but there is confidence that  by the time the season restarts the restrictions will be relaxed. That would allow all teams, with the likely exception of the Warriors, to base themselves at home and travel interstate on chartered flights on game day.

It was also determined that all teams would have to return to pre-season training at the same time to not disadvantage clubs such as the Warriors, who at this point will have to undergo a 14-day self-isolation program when they arrive in Australia.

The attack, which could well be the final nail in the coffin of NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, has cast a huge cloud over Nine's future in the sport. The Herald's revelation that the NRL intends to play out the remainder of the 22 rounds was met with angst by Nine insiders, who had previously expressed a reluctance to push past the traditional early October grand final.

The sickness attacking sport was cost-accelerating, unsustainable debt, mainly for media rights of the football codes and cricket. All this came at a time the revenue streams of the free-to-air and pay-TV broadcasters were under siege from streaming services such as Netflix. Replay   So, when the NRL’s long-time FTA broadcast partner, Channel Nine, delivered a scathing attack on the code on Thursday, it was paradoxically both unprecedented and unsurprising. It’s all about cost. Nine doesn’t want to pay full freight for a disrupted season with falling viewership. Nor will the network even agree to pay a pro-rata amount for games telecast, given it will be played in empty stadiums, devoid of the theatre of the crowd, possibly all through 2020. Furthermore, Nine boss Hugh Marks probably wants to renegotiate the final two years of the 2018-22 contract. In fact, he almost certainly seeks to extend the existing contract at significantly reduced rates. The days when networks bought sports rights to prevent the opposition acquiring them – as Manly bought North Sydney first-graders and relegated them to reserve grade – are over. But for Nine to launch this brutal salvo on rugby league because it has been shut out of the confidential talks over a restructured 2020 competition is a diversion. Fox Sports, which televises exclusively five games a week to Nine’s simulcasted three, has been sidelined, too. Given that ARLC chairman Peter V’landys is very close to News Corporation, which owns Fox, and has been the beneficiary of some recent, lavish praise from its newspapers, Fox’s Patrick Delany could have come out with a petulant page one protest. ARLC chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP However, the shunning of both of the code’s telecasters ignores V’landys management approach, which is the converse of today’s inclusive style of empowering everyone around the boss. He is autocratic and makes decisions quickly. NRL clubs are finding that ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce and ex-member for Dubbo Troy Grant, a former NSW Nationals leader, have formed a triumvirate, with V’landys dominating and everyone else subservient. Clubs are equally in the dark, unsure whether the competition, due to restart on May 28, will be located in Sydney or Queensland, or whether it will be two conferences or one. Now, with the Herald suggesting all remaining rounds will be played, it would seem V’landys, while not talking to the telecasters, is at least listening, or more accurately, reading Marks’s play. While Fox Sports hasn’t attacked the NRL with the unprecedented venom of Nine, it’s not as if the Murdoch empire hasn’t played a hard line with the other football codes in these belt-tightening times. It is a network that has previously demonstrated a duty of care to Australian sports – it paid a restructured FFA above market rates to unshackle it from a nationalistic, sectional club structure and it elevated rugby union from shamateurism, launching Super Rugby 25 years ago with a $US550m 10-year contract. But Fox Sports is bleeding red ink. It is dependent on $1.07 billion in shareholders' loans, has made 200 staff redundant and stood down another 140 on Tuesday. Those numbers could yet double as it seeks to further protect its bottom line. Now Fox Sports is refusing to make another rights offer to Rugby Australia and will seek to free itself from soccer, with both sports having already sacked most of their staff. So, where does that leave rugby league? It is a sport on the federal government’s anti-siphoning list, meaning it must be offered to a FTA broadcaster before Foxtel can bid. The financial meltdown, aka the Corona Correction, won’t result in NRL being screened on the ABC, because no commercial network can exist without NRL or AFL. Channel Ten had NRL in the 1990s, lost AFL rights 10 years ago and, as Global Sport and Media’s Colin Smith says, it has caused ""a downward spiral ever since and led to their insolvency”. Rather than abandon rugby league, Nine is likely to seek  “exclusive NRL” content in a renegotiated contract, refusing Fox’s simulcast of its games. Nine’s boss has picked only his first mark. His next fight will be with Fox. Roy Masters is a Sports Columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", Roy Masters ,"April 9, 2020"

Three months into his stay at a specialist spinal unit at the Pinderfields Hospital in Yorkshire, Masoe was told last week he would need to move home to continue his rehabilitation due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, doctors managed to persuade hospital officials to keep him on the ward so his improvements could be monitored more closely. “I’m just making the most of every day in here,” Masoe said in an interview with Sky Sports. “I’ve made so much progress in myself and I’m very grateful to be in here “In just one week I've learnt how to transfer from my chair into a bath chair, I’ve started to walk with crutches. “I’ve got my own walking frame, so I walk around my bed just with a frame.

But I thought of my cousin and my mood just changed, straight away and I became a happier person. “Just knowing he has been in a wheelchair his whole life, I can’t be here sulking about myself where he hasn’t had the option to live his life to the fullest. “I’ve been lucky enough to do something I love for the last 12 years. “I’ve been in hospital for 12 weeks.

However, doctors managed to persuade hospital officials to keep him on the ward so his improvements could be monitored more closely. “I’m just making the most of every day in here,” Masoe said in an interview with Sky Sports. “I’ve made so much progress in myself and I’m very grateful to be in here “In just one week I've learnt how to transfer from my chair into a bath chair, I’ve started to walk with crutches. “I’ve got my own walking frame, so I walk around my bed just with a frame. The physios have been awesome. “If I fall over, they’ve taught me how to crawl and to climb up onto something to get you back into the chair. I’ve learnt that all in a week.” The giant New Zealander has been inundated with support from the rugby league community in England and Australia with his former Roosters teammates visiting him during their recent European trip for the World Club Championship match against St Helens.

But I thought of my cousin and my mood just changed, straight away and I became a happier person. “Just knowing he has been in a wheelchair his whole life, I can’t be here sulking about myself where he hasn’t had the option to live his life to the fullest. “I’ve been lucky enough to do something I love for the last 12 years. “I’ve been in hospital for 12 weeks.

20,/sport/afl/afl-given-cover-for-earlier-restart-by-desperate-nrl-20200408-p54ien.html,AFL given cover for earlier restart by desperate NRL,"The NRL hopes to be playing games by the end of May. This prospective starting date is actually several weeks, if not months, ahead of what AFL club people believed probable for their resumption. In AFL clubland, there was a widespread view up until last weekend that footy wouldn't resume in crowdless stadia – no matter where those games were played – until perhaps late July or August. The AFL played just one round behind closed doors before the season was halted.Credit:AAP The Victorian government advice, based on the medicos and experts who study the pandemic and project what will unfold, had been that the coronavirus peak would be around late May or early June. But the NRL seems to have developed some form of immunity from the virus, to the point that they're preparing to open the games, though obviously not the turnstiles, on either May 21 or May 28, with the caveat that the competition will be relocated to Sydney, where most of the clubs are based. The AFL does not think that the NRL's decisions are relevant to what the financially stronger code does next, or that rugby league's eagerness to jump from the gates – an analogy that befits ARLC chairman Peter V'landys, who also runs Racing NSW – will see them follow the leader. But, in terms of public perceptions about what is acceptable and unacceptable for a sporting code amid a global pandemic, rugby league, in their unseemly desperation to play, are providing cover for the AFL. The AFL has been consistently saying that it will act on the advice of the federal and state governments. They are only mildly desperate to resume, as distinct from the absolute desperation of rugby league, which does not have a stadium to provide security for a line of credit and can survive only by getting the game on screens. Replay   As one rugby league official told The Sydney Morning Herald's Michael Chammas, for the AFL not playing games is like losing a limb, whereas it represents ""decapitation for the NRL"". That rugby league games could resume as early as late May seems extraordinary. It reveals not simply the extent of desperation to get the the broadcasting tap turned back on, but that there is clearly a special relationship with the NSW government, whose Deputy Premier John Barilaro told Channel Nine: ""The NRL is the tonic we need to get through through this"". V'landys, as the CEO of Racing NSW, has managed to keep that sport on track, to so speak. He must carry a decent whip; certainly, he is a persuasive man when dealing with the NSW government, which is reportedly willing to grant rugby league an exemption under the state's Public Health Order Act to get back on. The AFL has serious clout, too, but might not be able to plonk all their players in one city or town, given the logistics of a competition with teams in five states, including Western Australia and South Australia. Perhaps they can look at Sydney as a venue, given that the NRL has been given approval far earlier than the public expected. One senior AFL club official, observing the NRL's position compared to the AFL, observed: ""The NRL is ploughing the path for the AFL ... they're doing the heavy lifting."" Not for the first time and probably not for the last time, the AFL can look virtuous by comparison, in this case, simply by waiting just a little longer.

21,/sport/rugby-union/this-reset-might-be-just-the-thing-to-make-rugby-great-again-20200408-p54icp.html,This reset might be just the thing to make rugby great again,"So where was rugby before it was so rudely interrupted? I remember. It was a Bledisloe in the mid-1990s before the professional era, and the Wallabies were about to play the All Blacks in New Zealand. In the hour or two before kick-off, the injured John Eales was on duty as one of the ""dirt trackers"", flogging souvenir Wallabies T-shirts in the car park. The money raised would be added to the tour fund to be divided equally between players after the final Test, which would add a few hundred dollars to the $50 a day they were each earning on tour. Glory days ... Former Wallabies captain John Eales raises The William Webb Ellis Trophy after the 1999 World Cup.Credit:Tim Clayton At that time, all the Wallabies had their own jobs - some with serious careers in business, law, engineering, dentistry - and the primary motivation for playing was personal pride, for national honour. Beyond their playing commitments, each Wallaby understood that beyond playing they were expected to give back to the rugby community, to speak at end-of-season dinners for free, do kids training sessions, turn up at whatever rugby functions were happening and generally beat the rugby drum. The idea that they were not just players but ambassadors for the game was not only taken seriously, but cherished by the players. And then it all changed with stunning rapidity. Just over a year after flogging T-shirts for $20  – and Kiwi bucks at that – Eales signed a contract for a reputed $500,000 a year, when rugby went professional, and the game changed forever. Or did it? But we’ll get to that ... Replay   The first burst of professional rugby in Australia, basically until just a bit after the Eales era was over, went better than anyone could have imagined: the Wallabies started winning Bledisloes; lifted the 1999 World Cup; beat the British and Irish Lions; and crowds swelled as never before. The Waratahs regularly played before crowds of 40,000 at the Sydney Football Stadium and everyone in the wider rugby community felt a deep connection to their representative teams. In the past few years, however? I know it, and you know it. The game in this country has lost its way, on and off the field. Both the provincial teams and the Wallabies more or less stopped winning, the crowds stopped coming and, most worryingly of all, there was a loss of connection between the rugby community and our highly paid stars. After the Wallabies miraculously made the final of the World Cup in 2015, I had to threaten management with holy hell to get five Wallabies to turn up at a Cauliflower Club lunch, where 800 of the rugby community were gathering to welcome them home. I was told at the time the cause of their reluctance was because they were ""tired, after a long World Cup"". Ambassadors for the game? Not really. Raelene Castle had to threaten her own holy hell to get some of the 2019 Wallabies to turn up for a function at the Australian embassy in Tokyo during that year’s World Cup. The same malaise was apparent at provincial level. Earlier this year, the fine rugby folk of Albury did a promotion on the morning of a trial match between the Rebels and the Brumbies, saying come and meet the stars, only to be advised by Brumbies management a short time before their scheduled appearance that they wouldn’t be coming because there was a bit of drizzle. Tevita Kuridrani of the Brumbies is tackled by NSW playmaker Will Harrison during round seven of Super Rugby, just before the season was suspended.Credit:Getty Who was there? Nick Farr-Jones and Tim Gavin, two Wallabies of the old days, still turning up to  beat the rugby drum all those years on, for no reward. My point? Rod Kafer is right in saying Australian rugby has been sick for many years, and we all know that. I disagree strongly, however, in attributing the slide to any person in particular or even a few people. Mostly the people you see at the top level are seriously good rugby folk – and I am thinking particularly at board and chair level – doing their absolute best for the game, with their only reward being endless headaches and bitter public criticism as everyone rips in. What ails the game in this country is not due to particular people making wrong decisions. The way back to rude rugby health will not be an easy one. The coronavirus pause, however, is going to allow a massive reset of the game in this country. It's a time to recognise what has gone wrong and how we can come together as rugby people of good will to fix it, make it better. I say the starting point is we need to get back to the old values as much as possible, make players understand they owe the game far more than the game will ever owe them. Got that, you blokes? While it is one thing for you to make a good living from it, if you don’t have a sense of privilege in wearing the jersey, you needn’t bother putting the boots on in the first place, and good luck in rugby league, or France, or wherever. In the new age to come, we must build slowly. Cutting back players' salaries to rather more humble levels will be easy – the new cake to split up is going to be a lot smaller anyway. But let us also look at what professional rugby can learn from the amateurs. Before the plague, it was the amateur game that flourished as people flocked back to the club matches, with beer and sausages on the hill on a Saturday afternoon to watch the local team go round. Why, because they felt a connection to them. The new professional game must prize that connection most of all. A rough ride is ahead. But on the other side, at least we know our starting point will be populated only by the true believers. And this will be the sweetest victory of all. @Peter_Fitz Peter FitzSimons is a journalist and columnist with The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", ,"April 9, 2020"

The ARL Commission chairman flicks through his latest update on the dramatic fall in the daily increase of people testing positive to COVID-19 in NSW in recent weeks. Replay   On March 19, when the Bulldogs played North Queensland before no crowds in Thursday night football, the daily increase was 32 per cent. When V’landys announced the competition was shutting down on March 23, it was 22 per cent. “And today it is 2.21 per cent,” he said on Monday afternoon. “That’s why I think we can get back on soon.” V’landys’ haste in getting the NRL competition going again, in three or four “bubbles” in NSW and/or Queensland, is dividing opinion. He doesn't care. He's a divider, a disrupter, an agitator. The Rabbitohs celebrate a try against the Sharks in round one. When will they get to do it again?Credit:Getty His urgency reflects the need to get the money tap from the game’s broadcast partners flowing again. Both Fox Sports and Channel Nine (the publisher of this masthead) didn’t make their quarterly repayments on April 1, as you would expect. No football, no pay. The NRL wants to get the party going again as soon as possible, maybe as soon as the end of next month. But it needs to be wary about trashing the product. There are certainly some funky ideas getting about. As revealed by the Herald last week — and endorsed by NSW coach Brad Fittler — one idea before the innovation committee charged with rebooting the season is starting with State of Origin. Fittler went a step further and raised the prospect of Tongan players being available for selection after their mid-season Test against New Zealand was abandoned. There’s another idea of finishing the season with the Origin series, by which time crowds might be allowed to return to stadiums, thereby filling the coffers for a game that’s already taken a huge financial hit. Then there’s the novel idea of playing it in the middle of the season like it normally does. Crazy times. The notion of a best-of-three grand final series is also getting a run. So, too, 20-minute quarters — something V’landys was actually looking at pre-coronavirus as a way of maximising advertising revenue for broadcasters in the next TV deal. One funky proposal is to restart the season with a State of Origin season. Credit:AAP How about big, fat “no” to all of the above. This season will have an asterisk next to it no matter what happens — especially if the Warriors are excluded from the premiership. But let's not make it any bigger than it should be. Surely the aim is to keep the competition as pure as possible. “We want the competition to remain as authentic and genuine as we can,” V’landys said. “We don’t want people questioning if the grand final winner deserved it or not. That’s why we want to start the season as soon as possible.” A June start means every side could play each other once, a finals series, and an Origin series. Any later than that and the season starts pushing into the spring and potentially summer. That has ramifications for Nine because it's broadcasting all of Australia’s Twenty20 World Cup matches, as well as the finals series. Nine has told the NRL that it would need to renegotiate its deal if the NRL season went beyond Sunday, October 4 - the date set down for the grand final at the SCG - because it will have two major sporting events competing with each other. The T20 final is set down for November 15 — but there’s every chance it won’t be an issue because it remains murky at best whether Australia’s international borders will be open by October. Meanwhile, NRL clubs are torn about how the season should look — and when it should restart. How will players respond to being locked down, in isolation, for months at a time? The younger players might feel restless, and there are serious doubts about the ability of some to remain truly quarantined from the rest of society. What of the older players with young families? Souths hooker Damien Cook has said he will struggle being away from his for a fortnight. Sharks captain Wade Graham knows it will be tough but wants to get paid. The innovation committee, headed by Wayne Pearce, meets on Thursday but before then and beyond there’s a whole round of meetings — mostly via conference calls — taking place. Good luck to all concerned trying to navigate rugby league’s greatest obstacle course since News Limited and the ARL pieced the game back together in 1998 in the wake of the Super League war. No matter what happens, though, it should have one basic premise: make the NRL season as normal as possible, in the most abnormal year of our lives.

Instead, they're at their laptops, kicking their brains into gear. There are a few yawns and dodgy internet connections as assistant coach Chris Whitaker sets up a Zoom video conference call for half-a-dozen players who will spend the next 90 minutes or so forensically analysing a rugby match on the other side of the world. Waratahs playmaker Will Harrison has embraced the online sessions where he and teammates analyse rugby matches. Credit:James Brickwood The Sydney Morning Herald was invited to sit in on the meeting to observe how leading Australian rugby players are using their downtime to try and improve as players. Last week's review was a Six Nations fixture. What's on the menu today? Saracens up against Leinster in last year's Champions Cup final; Owen Farrell versus Johnny Sexton. There are only so many reviews the Waratahs can do of their six outings this year, so coaches have begun experimenting by getting a mix of experienced heads and rookies to discuss the intricacies and patterns of matches in a vastly different manner to what would normally happen during a regular Super Rugby season. The team's head performance analyst, Craig Whelan, is in charge of the match itself. He pauses and rewinds when either a coach or player asks. Halfback Jake Gordon gets the ball rolling, only after teammates have stopped chuckling at his new peroxide blond hair. He quickly explains he lost a game of Uno to roommate and fellow No.9 Mitch Short, who is also on the call. Gordon leans forward and begins discussing the merit of a longer-than-normal Saracens box kick. His eyes dart across the field. Immediately, the rugby jargon blurted from coaches and players is overwhelming for someone without anywhere near the technical knowledge of a professional player, or privy to specific team calls. These were just a few examples: ""Jam in on an AK. We'd do a Tuesday here. Double pump. Pods of three. Reloading. Inside, outside, one out the back. Setting up for a Dog. They were looking to do a Rhino."" (Top to bottom) Waratahs analyst Craig Whelan, assistant coach Chris Whitaker, Jake Gordon, Mitch Short, Alex Newsome and backs coach Matt Cockbain join a Zoom session.  There are, of course, longer and less complicated explanations, but the level of detail and deep thinking would surprise many rusted-on fans who consume the game passively at grounds or on television without a player soundtrack. Gordon and Will Harrison now have a robust debate as the game is paused. Head coach Rob Penney and Whitaker prefer to teach by asking questions rather than delivering lectures, much like high school teachers to their students. Should one or two players be in the backfield in this scenario? ""Think of the amount of tries that come from passes compared to kicks,"" Gordon says. ""How many tries off kicks would you see scored from 30 metres out? Why don't you make the priority your front line and encourage them to take the kick in back play. ""Because it makes the fullback work extra hard,"" Harrison says. ""You want them to go for that low-percentage play in that area of the field,"" Gordon says. It is fascinating watching players pick apart scenarios: analysing mismatches; how they could score with relevant set moves; how many to commit to rucks; whether the blindside or openside is a better option; what feedback should be shouted at what exact moment; as well as countless other factors taken into account. At the end, players offer opinions on the style and tactics of both teams. Even the quieter characters, such as rookies Ben Donaldson and Joey Walton, add value to the conversation. Rather than packaging up clips to review from a regular weekend match, the extended exercise is set to be the norm for players who are now largely confined to their homes. Despite some Waratahs staff being stood down, the Zoom calls will continue for as long as players are fronting up for work. ""Back in the day, you had VCRs, so you sat down and watched the whole game,"" Whitaker says afterwards. ""We're trying to get as many young guys in there as we can so they're learning. ""Back in the day when I was playing, the rugby brains were phenomenal. We had George Gregan, Stephen Larkham, Rod Kafer and John Eales to name a few. It was frightening. You watched and learnt off them and hopefully these guys learn off each other and everyone joins in. ""It's just trying to probe discussions and get guys thinking about it. The more decision-making on the field you have, the better you're going to go."" Harrison, who started at No.10 in all six games before the season was suspended, is young but curious by nature, having made a conscious effort, with Whitaker's encouragement, to watch a couple of rugby matches a day at home during the downtime. ""It's about developing our rugby IQs,"" Harrison says. ""It gives you a different perspective and way to look at things. It's more onto the players to break it down. ""Not everyone agrees with things. You can be brutally honest and bounce ideas off each other. It makes you think with more depth rather than just watching a game, and it definitely helps my footy as a five-eighth.""

Credit:James Brickwood The Sydney Morning Herald was invited to sit in on the meeting to observe how leading Australian rugby players are using their downtime to try and improve as players. Last week's review was a Six Nations fixture. What's on the menu today? Saracens up against Leinster in last year's Champions Cup final; Owen Farrell versus Johnny Sexton. There are only so many reviews the Waratahs can do of their six outings this year, so coaches have begun experimenting by getting a mix of experienced heads and rookies to discuss the intricacies and patterns of matches in a vastly different manner to what would normally happen during a regular Super Rugby season. The team's head performance analyst, Craig Whelan, is in charge of the match itself. He pauses and rewinds when either a coach or player asks. Halfback Jake Gordon gets the ball rolling, only after teammates have stopped chuckling at his new peroxide blond hair. He quickly explains he lost a game of Uno to roommate and fellow No.9 Mitch Short, who is also on the call. Gordon leans forward and begins discussing the merit of a longer-than-normal Saracens box kick. His eyes dart across the field. Immediately, the rugby jargon blurted from coaches and players is overwhelming for someone without anywhere near the technical knowledge of a professional player, or privy to specific team calls. These were just a few examples: ""Jam in on an AK. We'd do a Tuesday here. Double pump. Pods of three. Reloading. Inside, outside, one out the back. Setting up for a Dog. They were looking to do a Rhino."" (Top to bottom) Waratahs analyst Craig Whelan, assistant coach Chris Whitaker, Jake Gordon, Mitch Short, Alex Newsome and backs coach Matt Cockbain join a Zoom session.  There are, of course, longer and less complicated explanations, but the level of detail and deep thinking would surprise many rusted-on fans who consume the game passively at grounds or on television without a player soundtrack. Gordon and Will Harrison now have a robust debate as the game is paused. Head coach Rob Penney and Whitaker prefer to teach by asking questions rather than delivering lectures, much like high school teachers to their students. Should one or two players be in the backfield in this scenario? ""Think of the amount of tries that come from passes compared to kicks,"" Gordon says. ""How many tries off kicks would you see scored from 30 metres out? Why don't you make the priority your front line and encourage them to take the kick in back play. ""Because it makes the fullback work extra hard,"" Harrison says. ""You want them to go for that low-percentage play in that area of the field,"" Gordon says. It is fascinating watching players pick apart scenarios: analysing mismatches; how they could score with relevant set moves; how many to commit to rucks; whether the blindside or openside is a better option; what feedback should be shouted at what exact moment; as well as countless other factors taken into account. At the end, players offer opinions on the style and tactics of both teams. Even the quieter characters, such as rookies Ben Donaldson and Joey Walton, add value to the conversation. Rather than packaging up clips to review from a regular weekend match, the extended exercise is set to be the norm for players who are now largely confined to their homes. Despite some Waratahs staff being stood down, the Zoom calls will continue for as long as players are fronting up for work. ""Back in the day, you had VCRs, so you sat down and watched the whole game,"" Whitaker says afterwards. ""We're trying to get as many young guys in there as we can so they're learning. ""Back in the day when I was playing, the rugby brains were phenomenal. We had George Gregan, Stephen Larkham, Rod Kafer and John Eales to name a few. It was frightening. You watched and learnt off them and hopefully these guys learn off each other and everyone joins in. ""It's just trying to probe discussions and get guys thinking about it. The more decision-making on the field you have, the better you're going to go."" Harrison, who started at No.10 in all six games before the season was suspended, is young but curious by nature, having made a conscious effort, with Whitaker's encouragement, to watch a couple of rugby matches a day at home during the downtime. ""It's about developing our rugby IQs,"" Harrison says. ""It gives you a different perspective and way to look at things. It's more onto the players to break it down. ""Not everyone agrees with things. You can be brutally honest and bounce ideas off each other. It makes you think with more depth rather than just watching a game, and it definitely helps my footy as a five-eighth.""

As revealed last week, CA had drawn up three broad scenarios as part of the organisation's pandemic war gaming: a 25 per cent loss of revenue, a 50 per cent loss and a 100 per cent loss. Australian cricket would be hit hard financially if next season's Test series against India was scrapped.Credit:AAP However cricket sources have confirmed to The Age and Sydney Morning Herald that CA is honing in on the 50 per cent figure in its projections for the next 12 months, which is supposed to feature the men's Twenty20 World Cup and the lucrative marquee home men's series against India. Unlike the governing bodies of the major football codes, who have already copped colossal financial whacks as a result of their respective seasons being shut down in the early rounds, CA has considerably more time up its sleeve with next season still six months away, and no planned home international engagements until August's scheduled men's one-day series against Zimbabwe. But while the exact impact of the virus on CA remains unclear, measures including cost-cutting are being discussed internally as part of broad plans to deal with the possibilities the body is staring at over the next 12 months, including the chance the Indian Test series – worth around $300 million – doesn't go ahead. CA has already delayed the announcement of its central contract lists, hoping to gain further understanding of the sport's landscape. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017, players are bound to ride the financial waves experienced by the game as part of a revenue-sharing model. Several player agents have privately queried CA's decision to delay the contracting period, noting that barely any major cricket in Australia has yet been affected by the pandemic. According to its financial report last year, CA had net assets of almost $98 million including cash reserves of more than $26 million, although CA's financial model has long been centred around the influx of cash generated by the men's home series against India, meaning that next summer is arguably the one in which CA can least afford international cricket not to be played. Meanwhile the Australian Cricketers' Association on Wednesday announced a $250,000 emergency assistance fund to help its members suffering financial hardship as a result of the virus. The scheme is targeted at past players as well as current part-time female players who rely on an additional wage to supplement their cricket income. Players can receive up to $2000 from the ACA although any sum greater than $1000 will be provided as a loan. ""Over the past couple of weeks, we've spoken to several members who are doing it tough, and we've been trying to help where we can,"" said Kelly Applebee, the ACA's general manager of member programs and relations. ""We've worked hard over that time to bring together a framework around the support we can provide, as well as some significant resources, and we encourage those members who have felt the impact of the coronavirus and who are still waiting on government support, to get in touch with us as we may be able to help.""

As third umpire in that seismic Cape Town Test in March 2018, ""Gunner"" Gould has the evidence in a London vault, but says you would be surprised if you took a look. ""If you saw the balls, you would get it completely wrong,"" says Gould, nicknamed Gunner for his brief time in goal for Arsenal. ""At the end of the day, the sandpaper didn't get on that ball. They were working to get the ball to be pristine. Once they'd got one side bigger and shinier, that's when the sandpaper was coming in."" Steve Smith after arriving home from Cape Town in the wake of the  ball-tampering saga. Credit:AAP Gould's recollections of one of cricket's greatest scandals are shot through with comedy as well as first-hand insight. Midway through the drama that led to Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft being banned, an International Cricket Council official called the third umpire's room to say he had spotted a separate offence. Bear in mind, the on-field officials had already challenged Bancroft and the mood was suffocatingly tense. In his new autobiography, Gunner - My Life in Cricket, Gould, 62, recalls passing on the new information from the third umpire's booth, saying: ""Stay calm, and ask Nathan Lyon what colour socks he's wearing.'"" The reply from the pitch: ""Seriously? Go on, what's the punchline?"" Gould again: ""No punchline, seriously. They think that Nathan is wearing black socks. Ask him to show you his socks."" ""They want us to ask Nathan Lyon what colour socks he's wearing, in the middle of this s--- storm?'"" Lyon's response was expletive-filled, but he did run off and return with white socks on. Then the true scandal really broke, when more TV pictures showed Bancroft concealing sandpaper, and shame descended not only on Australia's cricket team, but the nation.

As third umpire in that seismic Cape Town Test in March 2018, ""Gunner"" Gould has the evidence in a London vault, but says you would be surprised if you took a look. ""If you saw the balls, you would get it completely wrong,"" says Gould, nicknamed Gunner for his brief time in goal for Arsenal. ""At the end of the day, the sandpaper didn't get on that ball. They were working to get the ball to be pristine. Once they'd got one side bigger and shinier, that's when the sandpaper was coming in."" Steve Smith after arriving home from Cape Town in the wake of the  ball-tampering saga. Credit:AAP Gould's recollections of one of cricket's greatest scandals are shot through with comedy as well as first-hand insight. Midway through the drama that led to Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft being banned, an International Cricket Council official called the third umpire's room to say he had spotted a separate offence. Bear in mind, the on-field officials had already challenged Bancroft and the mood was suffocatingly tense. In his new autobiography, Gunner - My Life in Cricket, Gould, 62, recalls passing on the new information from the third umpire's booth, saying: ""Stay calm, and ask Nathan Lyon what colour socks he's wearing.'"" The reply from the pitch: ""Seriously? Go on, what's the punchline?"" Gould again: ""No punchline, seriously. They think that Nathan is wearing black socks. Ask him to show you his socks."" ""They want us to ask Nathan Lyon what colour socks he's wearing, in the middle of this s--- storm?'"" Lyon's response was expletive-filled, but he did run off and return with white socks on. Then the true scandal really broke, when more TV pictures showed Bancroft concealing sandpaper, and shame descended not only on Australia's cricket team, but the nation.

The Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2020, published on Thursday, crowns Stokes as the sport's pre-eminent player – the first Englishman to receive the prestigious honour since Andrew Flintoff in 2005. The award is the latest to be bestowed upon the 28-year-old all-rounder following his heroic exploits last summer, when he inspired his team to an unforgettable triumph in the World Cup before producing one of the greatest innings of all time to win the Ashes Test at Headingley.

First, with a mixture of outrageous talent and good fortune, he rescued England's run-chase in the World Cup final, before helping to hit 15 off the super over,"" said Wisden editor Lawrence Booth. ""Then, in the third Ashes Test at Headingley, he produced one of the great innings, smashing an unbeaten 135 to pinch a one-wicket win. Against red ball or white, he was a force of nature."" Wisden has also revealed its five cricketers of the year, led by Stokes' World Cup-winning teammate Jofra Archer. Archer became a first-choice player in an England one-day side for the World Cup and by the time the Lord's finale came down to its last six deliveries, it was the Barbados-born paceman who stood up to be counted by sending down the super over. He was just as important to the Ashes, bowling at lightning speed on Test debut in a duel with Steve Smith that will live long in the memory. Of the remaining order, three are Australian with nods for Pat Cummins, Marnus Labuschagne and Ellyse Perry – who also reclaimed the leading women's cricketer in the world title from Smriti Mandhana. Cummins, currently ranked as the world's No.1 Test bowler by the ICC, was a dominant force as Australia retained the Ashes urn in a 2-2 series draw, taking 29 wickets at 19.62. Labuschagne would have been considered a long shot for such recognition at the start of the summer but went from strength to strength after becoming international cricket's first concussion substitute after the brutal conclusion to Archer versus Smith. He went on to average more than 50 and has gone from back-up player to No.3 batsman in the Test standings. PA Copyright © 2020", ,"April 8, 2020"

However, club sources suggest the suspension of games hasn't derailed talks, with Sydney FC expecting to finalise the paperwork before the start of next season, allowing Peupion to seal a dream move to the English Premier League. Aiding the negotiations is the strong relationship between the clubs, which has been forged by Paul Reid.

FFA technical director Rob Sherman tendered his resignation after less than a year in the job. A highly respected figure in football and coaching education globally, Sherman self-published his vision for the game through LinkedIn, declaring that the coronavirus crisis is a rare opportunity to ""rewrite"" the future of football in Australia and cannot be wasted.

The 33-year-old tested positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine on matchday after playing for Sandringham in May last year and has been serving a provisional suspension since June 6, 2019. Sam Gilbert in action for the Saints in 2018.Credit:AAP Gilbert had retired from the AFL at the end of 2018 after playing 208 games with the Saints, which included the 2009 and 2010 grand finals, and taken up an assistant coaching and playing role with St Kilda's VFL affiliate in 2019. However as he was playing in the VFL competition he was still subject to ASADA's anti-doping rules. ASADA investigated Gilbert and he is understood to have made submissions. However he accepted the penalty after receiving an infraction notice rather than take his case to a hearing. It was accepted in the decision to impose a two-year penalty on Gilbert that the substance was taken in a context unrelated to the sport and not in order to gain an advantage. However he was not granted a reduction on the basis of the presence of cocaine being due to no significant fault on his behalf. Several players – who were on AFL lists at the time of their positive test including Collingwood's Sam Murray and Gold Coast's Brayden Crossley – had their penalties reduced to below two years as they argued there was no significant fault. Under a revision to WADA rules to be introduced in 2021, athletes found with a metabolite for cocaine in their system on match day will not receive such lengthy suspensions, with the penalty to be reduced to three months. It's possible Gilbert could apply to have his penalty reconsidered under that new rule at the start of next year, which would allow him to coach or continue playing before June 2021. Players in the VFL who are not on AFL lists are subject to the AFL anti-doping code and random match-day testing, but they are not covered by the AFL's illicit drug code. Gilbert played his final game for the Saints in round 23, 2018 after making his debut in 2006. He became a highly regarded defender and is well respected at the club.

This prospective starting date is actually several weeks, if not months, ahead of what AFL club people believed probable for their resumption. In AFL clubland, there was a widespread view up until last weekend that footy wouldn't resume in crowdless stadia – no matter where those games were played – until perhaps late July or August. The AFL played just one round behind closed doors before the season was halted.Credit:AAP The Victorian government advice, based on the medicos and experts who study the pandemic and project what will unfold, had been that the coronavirus peak would be around late May or early June. But the NRL seems to have developed some form of immunity from the virus, to the point that they're preparing to open the games, though obviously not the turnstiles, on either May 21 or May 28, with the caveat that the competition will be relocated to Sydney, where most of the clubs are based. The AFL does not think that the NRL's decisions are relevant to what the financially stronger code does next, or that rugby league's eagerness to jump from the gates – an analogy that befits ARLC chairman Peter V'landys, who also runs Racing NSW – will see them follow the leader. But, in terms of public perceptions about what is acceptable and unacceptable for a sporting code amid a global pandemic, rugby league, in their unseemly desperation to play, are providing cover for the AFL. The AFL has been consistently saying that it will act on the advice of the federal and state governments. They are only mildly desperate to resume, as distinct from the absolute desperation of rugby league, which does not have a stadium to provide security for a line of credit and can survive only by getting the game on screens. Replay   As one rugby league official told The Sydney Morning Herald's Michael Chammas, for the AFL not playing games is like losing a limb, whereas it represents ""decapitation for the NRL"". That rugby league games could resume as early as late May seems extraordinary. It reveals not simply the extent of desperation to get the the broadcasting tap turned back on, but that there is clearly a special relationship with the NSW government, whose Deputy Premier John Barilaro told Channel Nine: ""The NRL is the tonic we need to get through through this"". V'landys, as the CEO of Racing NSW, has managed to keep that sport on track, to so speak. He must carry a decent whip; certainly, he is a persuasive man when dealing with the NSW government, which is reportedly willing to grant rugby league an exemption under the state's Public Health Order Act to get back on. The AFL has serious clout, too, but might not be able to plonk all their players in one city or town, given the logistics of a competition with teams in five states, including Western Australia and South Australia. Perhaps they can look at Sydney as a venue, given that the NRL has been given approval far earlier than the public expected.

The women's league is facing an uncertain future after four seasons in operation as the AFL tackles the biggest financial crisis in its history due to the coronavirus outbreak. Some clubs that fielded AFLW teams during the incomplete 2020 season are questioning whether they can afford to continue doing so beyond this year. Tilly Lucas-Rodd, left, is among AFLW players who have expressed concern over the future of the competition. Credit:AAP Multiple players spoken to by AAP in recent days have expressed concerns that AFLW might be sacrificed or scaled back as part of drastic AFL cost-cutting measures. ""There's a lot of uncertainty whether it [a 2021 season] will even happen because the AFL has taken a huge financial hit with this stuff,"" St Kilda's Tilly Lucas-Rodd said. ""It is uncertain whether it will happen, how long it will be and what it will look like. ""But you've got to push that to the side and think it's going to happen because there's obviously bigger things in the world going on that are more important at the moment than footy."" AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has publicly said the league's intention is to ensure AFLW continues in the 14-team format that emerged from last year's expansion process. The $600 million line of credit secured by the AFL last week could provide the lifeline the women's competition needs. But there are many competing interests the AFL needs to prioritise as it navigates its way through the financial crisis, including keeping 18 clubs and the men's competition viable. West Coast captain Emma Swanson said the future of AFLW had been on players' minds since the season was abruptly cancelled last month because of government restrictions put in place to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. ""There's been a mountain of work put into women's football over a number of years and particularly over the last four or five years into the AFLW,"" Swanson said. ""You just hope that there's been too much work put into it to just let it slide away now. ""I stand by the AFL ... I'm sure they'll do everything they can to make sure we're still running around next year some time."" AFLW coaches Nathan Burke (Western Bulldogs) and Steve Symonds (Collingwood) also urged the AFL not to let the women's competition stagnate or fall by the wayside after years of growth that have provided significant benefit to the game overall.

Credit:AAP Multiple players spoken to by AAP in recent days have expressed concerns that AFLW might be sacrificed or scaled back as part of drastic AFL cost-cutting measures. ""There's a lot of uncertainty whether it [a 2021 season] will even happen because the AFL has taken a huge financial hit with this stuff,"" St Kilda's Tilly Lucas-Rodd said. ""It is uncertain whether it will happen, how long it will be and what it will look like. ""But you've got to push that to the side and think it's going to happen because there's obviously bigger things in the world going on that are more important at the moment than footy."" AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has publicly said the league's intention is to ensure AFLW continues in the 14-team format that emerged from last year's expansion process. The $600 million line of credit secured by the AFL last week could provide the lifeline the women's competition needs. But there are many competing interests the AFL needs to prioritise as it navigates its way through the financial crisis, including keeping 18 clubs and the men's competition viable. West Coast captain Emma Swanson said the future of AFLW had been on players' minds since the season was abruptly cancelled last month because of government restrictions put in place to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. ""There's been a mountain of work put into women's football over a number of years and particularly over the last four or five years into the AFLW,"" Swanson said. ""You just hope that there's been too much work put into it to just let it slide away now. ""I stand by the AFL ... I'm sure they'll do everything they can to make sure we're still running around next year some time."" AFLW coaches Nathan Burke (Western Bulldogs) and Steve Symonds (Collingwood) also urged the AFL not to let the women's competition stagnate or fall by the wayside after years of growth that have provided significant benefit to the game overall.

He's a really good horse, isn't he?” jockey Glen Boss said as he prepares to take the reins of the Melbourne Cup winner on Saturday. “He's just a really good horse. I can't believe he's nowhere to be spoken about. “He's the fresh horse on the scene. He's very effective at the trip. His first run was a ripper and he just showed he's back. “Regardless of all that, he's just a really good racehorse. You can't pick apart his form and say he got lucky winning the Melbourne Cup.” Traditionally, Australian Melbourne Cup winners are held in high regard when they return, but it appears as if Vow And Declare has been cast purely as a stayer. Trainer Danny O’Brien has targeted Vow And Declare at the Queen Elizabeth Stakes as part of the  preparation for his Melbourne Cup defence in November and indications are he has come back a better, stronger horse. The Declaration Of War four-year-old ran home into third in the Australian Cup behind Fifty Stars and subsequent All-Star Mile winner Regal Power at his first run since his win on the first Tuesday in November, and O’Brien just wants Saturday to be a strong test over the Randwick 2000m. We want it to be willing because he is a strong stayer, and I don’t think the soft ground will worry him. “He has had the Australian Cup run and a really strong gallop on race day the other day,” O'Brien  said. “He is going to present really well for the Queen Elizabeth. If the race was 2400m I would be very confident of [winning], but 2000m is just outside of his best trip. “But if it was to become a test of stamina, that would be a big advantage for him. We want it to be willing because he is a strong stayer, and I don’t think the soft ground will worry him. “Bossy has a ride on him for a win last year and has always had a big opinion of him.” Boss summed up his contenders but wouldn't want to be on any other horse on Saturday than Vow And Declare, who he won the Tatt’s Cup on in Brisbane last year. “You know what Chris's filly [Verry Elleegant] is doing, she's absolutely airborne at the moment,” Boss said. “I think a couple of our horses might have the measure of [Addeybb], but the Japanese are so good at travelling and [Danon Premium] has obviously got really good form. It could blow us all away, but who knows. “But don’t count my bloke out of it.” Vow And Declare will stay in work from now until the Melbourne Cup, but O’Brien is looking to re-program him with no Queensland carnival. “The plan was always Australian Cup, Queen Elizabeth and then Brisbane. Obviously the Queensland part of it is out now,” O’Brien said. “He could even end up running in the Andrew Ramsden [a Melbourne Cup qualifier at Flemington in May] which is weight-for-age, and we will look for other races. “We are going to do exactly what we did with him last year. He was first-up in April and his last run was in the Melbourne Cup and he just stayed in work. “We are just going to chip away.

His pair of Kiwis already have international form references from the spring and he believes they are going better now. Te Akau Shark and Melody Belle are ready for the international challenge of the Queen Elizabeth StakesCredit:AAP Te Akau Shark closed off into third behind Lys Gracieux in last year's Cox Plate, while Melody Belle was runner-up to Magic Wand in the Mackinnon Stakes. “We know where we stand in terms of international form and if they run up to their spring form, the Kiwis will be competitive,” Richards said. “We have have them in the right sort of shape to do that, if not a bit better than the spring. “I have a lot of respect for the internationals but we still have got to have a crack at them and we knew would have to beat them in this race.” Te Akau Shark has become a two-time group 1 winner this preparation but is still a $6 third pick in the betting behind Japanese star Danon Premium, the $3.60 favourite, and the Ranvet Stakes winner Addeybb at $4.60. After a hat-trick of wins to start his campaign, Te Akau Shark was found out when back in the field as the George Ryder Stakes become a sprint home, where he could only manage third behind Dreamforce. There has been a drama around Te Akau Shark having a bruised foot since after he stepped on stone at Randwick, but he hasn't missed any fast work and Richards believes a testing 2000m will suit him. “He was caught out by the slow speed last time and things didn’t go our way. He is a horse that settles and can accelerate off a good speed,"" Richards said. “We have spaced his [runs] because he enjoys that time to recover and he is very sharp going into Saturday. Melody Belle wins the Empire Rose Stakes at Flemington in the spring.

He is a lot stronger now [than the spring]."" Te Akau Shark's preparation has been designed to match last spring and it is the same with Melody Belle, who backs up after being fourth in Nettoyer's Doncaster last weekend. She had a similar back-up in the spring and ran out a strong 2000m. “I just thought with her if we went to the mile again [in the Coolmore Legacy] we would get caught wanting a little bit,” Richards said. ""This has always been her target race. What have tried to do is mirror what we did in the spring where she won the Empire Rose and backed up well in the Mackinnon Stakes at 2000m. “Opie has stuck with the Shark but Kerrin McEvoy is good replacement and I would expect her to run well.” Richards will watch on television from lockdown in New Zealand and is hopeful of another Australian group 1 double. He kicked the autumn off in style with Te Akau Shark and Probabeel in the Chipping Norton Stakes and Surround Stakes on February 29. Probabeel gets to her final destination in the Australian Oaks and Richards is hoping the track will get towards a good rating. “She is in good shape. We would rather sunshine than rain this week,” Richards said. ""I think she will sprint better on top of the ground. ""I don’t think the 2400m is a problem for her.

It's fillies and mares, a mile at Randwick which is perfect. She races really well fresh',"" Boss recalled. ""She decided to go to the Doncaster and I thought, 'please don't do that'."" But Roche did. And coming from last on the turn under group 1 rookie James Innes jnr, Nettoyer provided one of the biggest boilovers in Doncaster history. Boss had ridden lightly weighted three-year-old Brandenburg into third - and after the race didn't know how to react. He smiled, laughed and shook his head all at the same time. Behind the barriers at the trials I said Nettoyer could almost win the race. They laughed. ""That was never the plan [for Nettoyer to run in the Doncaster],"" he said. ""I rode her in the Ranvet [Stakes] and if you go back and have a look at the run and the sectionals, it was unbelievable. I said to Wendy, 'this thing is absolutely airborne'. ""Behind the barriers at the trials on Friday the boys were saying, 'if you can't win what can?' I said Nettoyer could almost win the race. They laughed. But I said, 'this horse can nearly win'. I didn't expect her to win like that [though]. ""I was always booked to ride her [in the Coolmore Legacy]. That's just the way it is."" So a week after celebrating his first major by heading straight to his parents' place to pick up some toilet paper, Innes jnr will make way for big race veteran Boss. Even after her Doncaster heroics, bookmakers still don't seem completely convinced. Nettoyer was a $9.50 second pick with BetEasy on Wednesday, a long way behind Chris Waller's three-year-old Funstar ($2.80). None of it seems to faze Boss though, the three-time Melbourne Cup winner who had an extraordinary spring carnival winning NSW's two richest races in The Everest (Yes Yes Yes) and Golden Eagle (Kolding). Yet you suspect he would get just as much as a kick out of the cantankerous Nettoyer chalking up a second group 1 win in the space of a week. ""In a race she's really good,"" Boss said. ""You've just got to cuddle her and talk nicely to her. You've almost got to dangle that piece of pizza in front of her. If you try to stand over her she'll just lie down. ""It's a really good story and when James won it we were all so happy for him. That prize money is life-changing for him, a young guy with a young family. It reminded me of when I was that age and it's life-changing, those sort of moments."" Boss will also ride Melbourne Cup winner Vow And Declare in a mouth-watering Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Danny O'Brien's regular rider for the horse, Craig Williams, is prevented from travelling interstate due to the strict biosecurity measures in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Brian Borruso said in court papers on Tuesday he tried to take a selfie as Woods approached his tee shot left of the 13th green in the third round at Innisbrook. Replay   But Joe LaCava ""intentionally shoved"" him, causing him to stumble and fall into the crowd. Josh Drechsel, the lawyer representing Borruso, said the lawsuit was filed two years after the tournament to get a better understanding of the injuries, described in the lawsuit as ""either permanent or continuing."" Mark Steinberg, the agent for Woods at Excel Sports Management, did not immediately reply to a text seeking comment. LaCava said he had no comment. Tiger Woods' caddie Joe LaCava has been accused of ""intentionally shoving"" a fan.Credit:AP Drechsel, meanwhile, issued a public plea for evidence from fans who might have been at the 13th green that day and witnessed the incident. One video Dreshsel has shows LaCava approaching the fans with his left arm extended saying: ""You've got to back it up."" Drechsel says he wants to find the fans who could be heard on another video. ""One says, 'I love Tiger, but I don't like him' and another voice is heard saying, 'He just pushed him. He just shoved him right out of there.'"" The lawsuit says Borruso went to the hospital to be treated for his injuries. Woods played the Valspar Championship for the first time in 2018, a key event in his return from back surgeries. Before record crowds, at times standing a dozen rows deep around tee boxes, he came within one putt on the 18th hole of forcing a play-off and finished one shot behind Paul Casey. Woods was named as a defendant because he employs LaCava, who previously was the long-time caddie for Fred Couples and began working for Woods in the autumn of 2011. Drechsel said he asked the PGA Tour for video from the tournament but said the tour told him it was unable to provide any without a court order. AP Copyright © 2020", Doug Ferguson ,"April 9, 2020"

The eight-team national competition has been delayed until at least the end of June and chief executive Chris Symington says a range of scenarios are being explored dependent on when they can begin play. The coronavirus crisis has put the NSW Swifts' Super Netball title defence on hold.Credit:AAP ""We are still working to get an understanding of what's possible from a logistical point of view and also what's achievable for our teams and our broadcaster,"" Symington said. The competition was set to begin on May 2 and run over 14 rounds (or 18 weeks) including a split round and three weeks of finals. Symington said there was no ""drop-dead"" date for the competition to begin and felt netball had an advantage over competitions such as AFL and NRL because the lack of physical contact meant multiple games could be played within a shorter period. ""Given the nature of the sport there is the ability to potentially play mid-week, so you could condense and run a shorter version of the season – so the same amount of matches but over a shorter time frame,"" Symington said. ""That could halve our time frame to eight weeks because you could also look at packaging our three weeks of finals into one weekend or sudden death play-offs, so that's also on the table."" He said that a Netball World Cup tournament-style approach was also a possibility. ""That's something we could potentially do and capture as much content as we could in that time-frame without placing too much load on the athletes,"" Symington said. ""They would probably all go to a single location – where that is is anyone's guess at this stage. ""But you could take all teams to a single location as you would for a World Cup ... and you play a tournament style with multiple matches within a short period of time. ""That's a last resort based on timing toward the end of the year."" Symington recognised there could be some broadcasting challenges among a packed sporting schedule toward the end of the year with their free-to-air partner Nine Network also committed to the NRL. ""There's no doubt there's potential for a bottleneck to occur at the back half of the year when the shackles hopefully come off,"" he said. ""We need to make sure we're keeping an eye on where we fit in the mix so we can still create some clear air."" AAP Copyright © 2020", Melissa Woods ,"April 9, 2020"

The tennis season was halted in early March due to the pandemic, leaving players in the lower tiers who solely depend on tournament winnings without the opportunity to earn a living. Patrick Mouratoglou (left) says lower-level players shouldn't be forced to struggle financially.Credit:Keystone In a letter posted on Twitter and addressed to the tennis community, Mouratoglou said the current situation showed how ""dysfunctional"" the sport was. ""Unlike basketball or football players, tennis players aren't covered by fixed annual salaries. They're independent contractors,"" he said. ""They're paying for their travels. They're paying fixed salaries to their coaching staffs, while their own salaries depend on the number of matches they win."" While tennis rewards top players handsomely, those in the lower echelons often struggle to make ends meet. Mouratoglou, who started working with Williams in 2012 and has guided her to 10 of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles, said the top players deserved everything they earned. ""However, I find it revolting that the 100th-best player of one of the most popular sports in the world – followed by an estimated one billion fans – is barely able to make a living out of it,"" the Frenchman said. The men's ATP Tour and the WTA, which runs the women's circuit, suspended all tournaments until mid-July after countries started locking down their borders to contain the spread of the flu-like virus. A 2018 International Review Panel report commissioned to address betting and integrity issues said that players in the lowest tiers were susceptible to corruption because of the difficulty in making a living. Only 250-350 players, the report said, earned enough to break even. Georgia's Sofia Shapatava, the world's 375th-ranked women's singles player, has started a petition seeking assistance from the International Tennis Federation for lower-level professionals. Many others have joined her to voice their concerns about the financial hardships players face during the shutdown. The WTA and the ATP said they were working to boost players' earnings when the sport resumed and might extend the 2020 season to allow more tournaments to be held. Mouratoglou said it was crucial to keep lower-level players in the game. ""We all rely on those governing bodies, who have the power to protect the professional tennis economy and hold social responsibility,"" he added.
