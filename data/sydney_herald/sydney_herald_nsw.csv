Adrian Brennock and Phillip Dixon were each awarded $200,000 plus legal costs when a judge found Gillian Norman had consistently defamed them on her two blogs and in an article she wrote for the Nimbin Good Times newspaper. The men were linked to a failed attempt to establish the ""Bhula Bhula Intentional Community"" on a property at Mount Burrell, near the alternative mecca of Nimbin in the Northern Rivers. The commune was at Mount Burrell, near the alternative mecca of Nimbin in northern NSW (pictured).Credit:Janie Barrett The commune was partially led by Mark Darwin, who conducted seminars on alternative living at Byron Bay's Lighthouse Cafe and numerous other locations, under the banner of Truthology, which he described as ""the study of the truth"". Mr Brennock and Mr Dixon were associates of Mr Darwin, who was originally also a plaintiff in the case but discontinued. Wollumbin Horizons purchased the land in June 2015, and in August that year Ms Norman paid $120,000 for a unit in the associated trust. The following month she took part in a monthly ""camp-out"" on the land, but set up her camp in an ""exclusion zone"" near the Tweed River bank. At the end of the weekend, Ms Norman did not leave the site with the other unit holders. ""Instead she remained in occupation and made her camp steadily more permanent. She placed a campervan on the site and established a garden,"" the judgment said. From the middle of that year, Tweed Shire Council received multiple complaints from neighbours about unauthorised developments on the land. In 2017, following an application from the council, the Land and Environment Court gave the community 28 days to remove shipping containers and other structures from the land. Several investors, including Ms Norman, attempted to recover their money but ""the company had no funds from which to meet these claims"" and Wollumbin Horizons was wound up in late 2017. In his defamation suit ruling on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Desmond Fagan said the commune project was ""undoubtedly a debacle"" and Mr Darwin should not have solicited investments without verifying that the council would grant the relevant approvals. But he found Ms Norman was unable to show any justification for her assertion the men's conduct  ""went beyond folly to fraud"". ""Nor does she recognise the degree to which her own lack of care and judgment contributed to her loss,"" Justice Fagan wrote. Ms Norman was self-represented in court except for the final two days of the trial, when she hired a lawyer who, in the words of the judge, ""introduced a measure of order and focus in the defendant's case that had been lacking until then"". Justice Fagan also granted a permanent injunction restraining Ms Norman from making any further publications on the issue, as he perceived she held an ""irrational attitude"" towards the plaintiffs. ""Her persistence in the defence of truth, in the absence of evidence, is a strong indication of her fixated, crusading belief that they are fraudsters,"" he wrote.

Last month Alaedine Rifai, 41, and his partner Amal Hilmi, 36, pleaded guilty to defrauding the federal scheme of $1.5 million through a criminal syndicate that earned some members upwards of $50,000 a day. A Mercedes E63 registered in the name of Alaedine Rifai.Credit:Australian Federal Police Together the western Sydney couple enjoyed a lavish lifestyle funded by the proceeds of the criminal enterprise. For Ms Hilmi, that included an $83,000 Porsche Cayenne purchased in August 2018 in her name and a property in Goulburn, purchased for $280,000 the next month. For Mr Rifai, the proceeds of the fraud went towards a $62,000 Mercedes-Benz E63 and an $18,000 Audi S3, purchased in August and September 2018. Last year a court heard other luxury items such as watches, land and jewellery had also been purchased with the spoils of the syndicate. Valued at $340,000, the cars and the Goulburn property were formally forfeited to the Commonwealth in the NSW Supreme Court last week. The Audi S3 was also in Mr Rifai's name.Credit:AFP AFP officers arrested the pair in a series of raids across Sydney last year, following a six-month investigation by the NDIS fraud taskforce. The investigation exposed Mr Rifai and Ms Hilmi's involvement in the group, which netted money by hiding behind three registered NDIS service providers: Universal Group Australia, Reliance Disability Services and United Mission. The providers offered services such as nursing, cleaning, transport and home fit-outs. Under the conspiracy the couple lodged over-inflated invoices for such services and falsely drew from victims' disability plans, leaving them unable to make further claims. In other examples authorities found services were either deliver in part only or not at all. More than 50 people on disability plans are estimated to have been impacted. At the time of their arrest federal police acting Commander Mark McIntyre said the sole aim of the operation was ""to steal funds designed to support the participants of the NDIS just to service their own lavish lifestyle."" Last month the couple pleaded guilty in Sydney's Central Local Court to conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. They will next appear before the NSW District Court at a later date for sentencing. Both remain in custody until their next appearance. Stefan Jerga, Australian Federal Police national manager of Criminal Assets Confiscation, said the criminal operation had targeted some of the most vulnerable Australians “Fraud against the NDIS, and fraud more generally against government measures intended to support our most vulnerable and in need, is an insidious criminal activity,"" he said. ""This forfeiture should reassure our community that at this very challenging time for our nation, agencies across the Commonwealth are working proactively together to deliver and safeguard government measures, which support the community,"" he said. Mr Jerga said targeting the criminal economy by confiscating criminal assets and removing the profit from crime ""is one of a number of strategies ... to deliver maximum damage to the criminal environment.""

A parliamentary inquiry into the project found the ""case and rationale"" for converting a 13-kilometre stretch of the Bankstown Line, which will form part of the Sydney Metro City and Southwest project, has ""not been adequately made out"". The government has released a summary of the final business case for the 30-kilometre rail line from Chatswood to Bankstown via the CBD, leading to accusations the project lacks transparency. The plans to convert a section of the Bankstown Line to carry single-deck metro trains have been controversial.Credit:Simon Alekna The inquiry's report, released on Thursday, recommended the full business case be released immediately, and that the government end the metro line at Sydenham, instead of continuing it on to Bankstown. It argued that the Bankstown Line conversion was not ""value for money, and the projected benefits do not outweigh the expected disruption to local communities or damage to heritage and wildlife"". However, the three Coalition MPs on the inquiry described, in a dissenting statement, the recommendation to cancel the work to convert the Bankstown Line as a ""farce"", arguing the government was delivering on a key pledge it made at the state election a year ago. Upper house Greens MP Abigail Boyd, who chaired the inquiry, said the government would have released the entire business case long ago if it was confident the project would stand up to scrutiny. And Labor leader Jodi McKay said the failure to publish the business case was ""yet another example of the entrenched culture of secrecy within this government"". But a spokeswoman for Transport Minister Andrew Constance said the government was focused on its commitment to the ""community and delivering this project"". ""We took the Southwest Metro upgrade to last year’s election, and won,"" she said. The Herald recently revealed the government expects the cost of Metro City and Southwest to blow out by up to $3 billion, which will increase the final cost to $15.5 billion. The release of the report comes after the government this week indicated it will treat plans for another metro rail line from Sydney's CBD to Westmead, near Parramatta, as a key priority and a way to stimulate the economy once the coronavirus pandemic is over. It has called for expressions of interest from the private sector for the first two tunnelling contracts for the Metro West project from Westmead to Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush, and eastwards from Olympic Park to the Bays precinct near Rozelle. Tunnelling is due to start late 2022. Mr Constance has said Metro West will cost ""upwards of $20 billion"".  Matt O'Sullivan is City Editor at The Sydney Morning Herald.

Professor Gordon Wallace, of the University of Wollongong, said the institution was approached by the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district to manufacture face shields and make prototypes for spare ventilator parts. Blake Cochran is developing creative solutions to the protective equipment shortage.Credit:James Brickwood ""It’s all really been driven by them and their needs,"" he said. ""We’re here and ready to help."" The university, in collaboration with two local 3D printing companies, has been asked to produce 3000 face shields over the next three weeks. The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said. Universities are not used to manufacturing products, Associate Professor Mukerjee said, but if their prototype equipment was needed and deemed fit for purpose, it was possible for those institutions to scale up. “We need to all think differently and start stepping out of our comfort zone,” she said. It's not just universities helping. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor.Credit:Dominic Lorrimer At Marrickville, volunteers are using the clear plastic covers of unused office binders, sheets of foam and metres of double-sided tape to make protective face shields at the behest of one Sydney doctor. Reverse Garbage creative director Kirsten Junor said volunteers for the not-for-profit - which recycles industrial waste for creative purposes - had made 700 shields, with another 700 on the way. “They’re not glamorous, they’re not pretty, but that’s what Reverse Garbage does,"" Ms Junor said. ""It's about looking at things differently."" NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback. Dr Blake Cochran, a medical researcher and lecturer at UNSW, said it took just a couple of days to go from talking about potentially creating a face shield prototype to having products ready to test. “I never thought I'd work with industrial designers, it’s a creative approach to things,” he said. The face shields have been the focus of the UNSW team, but Dr Cochran said they would be happy to try designing something else. All it would take, he said, was for hospitals, local health districts or the health department to say “this is exactly what we need”. “Whatever the next need is, we’ve got really good people to help develop solutions,” he said. Ms Junor said demand for the face shields had been rising, prompting Reverse Garbage to call for donations to help stay open. ""Humans are so good at rallying,"" she said.

Newcastle District Court Judge Roy Ellis on Thursday indicated the May 4 trial would have been able to proceed if it was before a judge alone, but Hayne wanted a jury trial. Former NRL player Jarryd Hayne leaves the Newcastle Court in July 2019.Credit:AAP Judge Ellis said there would not be enough time to organise a jury panel for May 4. He also suggested the suspension on the use of juries during trials because of the coronavirus crisis would likely be lifted in the coming weeks. Defence barrister Phillip Boulten SC told the court via video link from Sydney that Hayne's legal team had considered a judge-alone trial ""very carefully"", but the former NRL player indicated he would prefer a jury trial. Mr Boulten said the Director of Public Prosecutions would have opposed a judge-alone trial anyway. Hayne, 32, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of aggravated sexual assault involving a woman in NSW's Hunter Valley. Judge Ellis agreed to vacate the May 4 trial date and ordered a new trial to begin on November 23. Prosecutor Wayne Creasey SC said the Crown accepted the new trial date. Hayne, who was excused from attending court, will not have to appear in person again until November 19 to confirm which judge will preside over the trial. The trial is expected to take two weeks. Judge Ellis agreed to a defence request to vary Hayne's bail so he no longer has to report to police once a week. The case will next return to court on July 2 for pre-trial argument over a subpoena. Hayne is accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman on September 30 in 2018 between 8pm and 10pm in Newcastle. Court documents state Hayne had sex with the woman without her consent and ""recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm"". He has been on bail since his arrest and was allowed to travel to Western Australia in July 2019 to attend a six-month missionary course at the Youth With A Mission centre. The court previously heard Hayne planned to stay in a dormitory-style accommodation near the evangelical Christian centre's training campus. The aggravated rape charges each carry a maximum 20-year jail term if Hayne is convicted. AAP Copyright © 2020", Mark Russell ,"April 9, 2020"

12,/politics/nsw/nsw-finalising-tenancy-relief-as-residential-rents-likely-to-drop-20200408-p54idb.html,NSW finalising tenancy relief as residential rents likely to drop,"The Berejiklian government's plans for residential rent relief will include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on the savings to tenants. NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the states had been working on ideas for rent relief following this week's national cabinet meeting. NSW is finalising residential rent relief as tenants are hit by the financial impact of the coronavirus. Credit:Jim Rice “Offering a degree of land tax waiver or deferral for landlords is something we are finalising,"" Mr Perrottet said. But Mr Perrottet urged tenants to keep paying rent. The government is keen to ensure relief measures only apply to people whose finances have been hit by the coronavirus crisis. ""Obviously many people are worried about keeping a roof over their head, but I don't believe something like a rent strike will ultimately help either party,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This is a complicated area and both sides face challenges, and I urge landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions at this extremely difficult time."" Rents are expected to drop in coming months, experts say, as a surge in rental properties combines with a drop in tenant demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19. The number of rentals hitting the Sydney market over the past three weeks was up 18 per cent year-on-year, according to Domain figures. A return of short-term holiday rentals to the longer-term market, a change in tenant circumstances and a drop off in migration are all behind the jump, according to Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell. ""The big question is if this is going to continue. If it does, we will see downward pressure on rents,"" Dr Powell said. Median Sydney asking rents rebounded over the first quarter — after reaching their lowest levels in years — according to the latest Domain Rent Report, but the turnaround could be over before it's truly begun. Median rents rose 1 per cent for houses to $530 a week, and 2 per cent for units to $520 a week, off the back of a fall in unit completions at a time of steady population growth, Dr Powell said. House rents are still $20 lower and unit rents $30 lower than the 2017-18 peak. ""Sydney house rents rose for the first time in three years and unit rents rose for the first time in two years ... [but] this trend is expected to be short-lived,"" Dr Powell said. Meanwhile, Sydney's vacancy rate rose 20 basis points in March to 2.7 per cent, after trending down since mid-2019. There were an estimated 14,528 vacant rentals at the end of the month – 845 more than the previous month, with some landlords already slashing rents by hundreds of dollars a week to attract tenants. Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty. While the federal government has put a moratorium on rental evictions for six months, it has left the provision of further rental assistance to states and territories. For now tenants are required to negotiate rent relief with their property manager or landlord – with mixed results. Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, expected vacancy rates to rise sharply over the short term and said asking rents were already starting to fall. ""At one stage Sydney was recording annual rent declines of 5 per cent, and then towards the end of last year rents started to stabilise; it's very possible we could see yet another 5 per cent decline but we don't know yet, we need to see the fallout first,"" he said. Mr Christopher said vacancy rates would also be impacted by the number of new homes being completed. While completions are on the decline, an expected pull back in buyer and tenant demand could lead to an oversupply of new homes. He added rental markets in Sydney and Melbourne, which take the lion's share of net migration from overseas, were likely to take the biggest hit. Maria Carlino, the national head of property management at The Agency, has seen the number of rental listings across the eastern seaboard jump about 30 per cent in recent weeks. At the same time, property inquiries from potential tenants have dropped about 35 per cent and days on market have increased. The increase in available rentals was giving tenants more choice and opportunity to negotiate, Ms Carlino said. Meanwhile, The Agency is also working through hundreds of requests for help, with tenants across 15 per cent of its Sydney portfolio seeking some form of rent relief. Ms Carlino said most landlords were understanding of tenants in genuine need of assistance, but many were awaiting further government announcements.

Sources with knowledge of official inquiries into the debacle revealed a conversation took place with the Port Authority of NSW employee and a Border Force officer in the hours before the ship was due to dock. The Ruby Princess cruise ship at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Circular Quay, Sydney.Credit:Kate Geraghty The officer expressed concern about passengers disembarking after being made aware that as many as 140 passengers aboard were in isolation due to health concerns. So serious were the concerns flagged, the harbourmaster offered to stop the ship at Bradley’s Head to prevent it docking at Sydney Harbour. According to the sources, the harbourmaster was told by the Border Force officer that they needed to check with a supervisor and 15 minutes later, the officer called back and said the ship could dock. The crucial development is understood to be a key part of a NSW Police criminal investigation examining the fiasco. There are as many as 650 passengers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and there have been 15 deaths. The sources said authorities would almost certainly examine who the Border Force official spoke to and why the decision not to leave the ship at Bradley’s Head was made. Border Force confirmed the telephone conversation between its officer and a ports authority employee in the early hours of March 19. ""The ABF officer made internal enquiries and subsequently advised the NSW Port Authority that the vessel had been cleared by NSW Health,"" a statement from Border force said. ""The ABF did not seek to shape or influence any view or decision by the NSW Port Authority."" NSW's total confirmed cases of COVID-19 stands at 2734, an increase of 49 cases on the previous day. There are 227 people being treated by NSW Health, including 36 patients in intensive care and 22 on ventilators. Premier Gladys Berejiklian told her MPs in a recent party room meeting that Border Force had wrongly told NSW Health that the cruise ship was deemed ""low-risk"" before it docked on March 19. Almost 2700 passengers were allowed to disembark in the early hours of March 19, with four cases of coronavirus confirmed hours later. An MP who was in the party room said Ms Berejiklian ""made it very clear that we did not fail, we were not responsible"". ""She was very defiant. We were absolutely not to blame,"" the MP said. But her comments prompted the Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram to hit back. ""What broke down in this case was ... health officers, trained doctors or nurses didn't get on board the vessel, swab passengers and take their swabs for results,"" Mr Outram said on March 25. He said his officers were responsible for ensuring there was no contraband and ensuring everyone had visas. The Department of Agriculture had the biosecurity responsibility, Mr Outram said. Replay   NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller revealed on Sunday there would be a criminal investigation, led by homicide detectives, and a likely coronial inquiry. Mr Fuller said an investigation was critical to determine whether the operators of the ship, Carnival Australia, were ""transparent"" about ill passengers. He also singled out the Ports Authority as doing an ""exceptional job"" after phone logs between the the authority and Carnival Australia suggested the ship downplayed the risk of COVID-19. The logs show the Ports Authority had initially not allowed the ship to dock because of coronavirus fears but then overturned that decision after being led to believe that there was no virus threat. On Wednesday, 30 detectives from State Crime, Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics and Marine Area commands were seconded to the criminal investigation dubbed Strike Force Bast. Investigators will interview ""high-priority witnesses"" this week and are urging passengers with relevant information to contact Crime Stoppers.

Mr Moselmane tendered his resignation on Monday afternoon, less than a year after he was elected in a secret ballot of NSW upper house MPs in May 2019. NSW Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane has been heavily criticised for praising China's President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus crisis.Credit:James Alcock His resignation relates only to the role of assistant president, which will see him forgo $57,525 in additional salary and allowances per year. The position will remain vacant until a replacement is appointed when Parliament sits in September. Mr Moselmane remains a member of the NSW upper house and a member of the Labor Party. Mr Moselmane resigned from the role following a week of intense criticism over public comments he made over China's handling of the pandemic, which included extolling President Xi Jinping's ""unswerving leadership"". Labor leader Jodi McKay has described his comments as ""appalling"", and said he would ""never be in the shadow cabinet"" but ruled out expelling him from the party. “He’s going through a very difficult time right now and I’m not going to expel him from the Labor Party,” Ms McKay told 2GB radio last week.

Mr Moselmane tendered his resignation on Monday afternoon, less than a year after he was elected in a secret ballot of NSW upper house MPs in May 2019. NSW Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane has been heavily criticised for praising China's President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus crisis.Credit:James Alcock His resignation relates only to the role of assistant president, which will see him forgo $57,525 in additional salary and allowances per year. The position will remain vacant until a replacement is appointed when Parliament sits in September. Mr Moselmane remains a member of the NSW upper house and a member of the Labor Party. Mr Moselmane resigned from the role following a week of intense criticism over public comments he made over China's handling of the pandemic, which included extolling President Xi Jinping's ""unswerving leadership"". Labor leader Jodi McKay has described his comments as ""appalling"", and said he would ""never be in the shadow cabinet"" but ruled out expelling him from the party. “He’s going through a very difficult time right now and I’m not going to expel him from the Labor Party,” Ms McKay told 2GB radio last week.

For Mr Rifai, the proceeds of the fraud went towards a $62,000 Mercedes-Benz E63 and an $18,000 Audi S3, purchased in August and September 2018. Last year a court heard other luxury items such as watches, land and jewellery had also been purchased with the spoils of the syndicate.

Newcastle District Court Judge Roy Ellis on Thursday indicated the May 4 trial would have been able to proceed if it was before a judge alone, but Hayne wanted a jury trial. Former NRL player Jarryd Hayne leaves the Newcastle Court in July 2019.Credit:AAP Judge Ellis said there would not be enough time to organise a jury panel for May 4. He also suggested the suspension on the use of juries during trials because of the coronavirus crisis would likely be lifted in the coming weeks. Defence barrister Phillip Boulten SC told the court via video link from Sydney that Hayne's legal team had considered a judge-alone trial ""very carefully"", but the former NRL player indicated he would prefer a jury trial. Mr Boulten said the Director of Public Prosecutions would have opposed a judge-alone trial anyway. Hayne, 32, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of aggravated sexual assault involving a woman in NSW's Hunter Valley. Judge Ellis agreed to vacate the May 4 trial date and ordered a new trial to begin on November 23. Prosecutor Wayne Creasey SC said the Crown accepted the new trial date. Hayne, who was excused from attending court, will not have to appear in person again until November 19 to confirm which judge will preside over the trial. The trial is expected to take two weeks. Judge Ellis agreed to a defence request to vary Hayne's bail so he no longer has to report to police once a week. The case will next return to court on July 2 for pre-trial argument over a subpoena. Hayne is accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman on September 30 in 2018 between 8pm and 10pm in Newcastle. Court documents state Hayne had sex with the woman without her consent and ""recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm"". He has been on bail since his arrest and was allowed to travel to Western Australia in July 2019 to attend a six-month missionary course at the Youth With A Mission centre. The court previously heard Hayne planned to stay in a dormitory-style accommodation near the evangelical Christian centre's training campus. The aggravated rape charges each carry a maximum 20-year jail term if Hayne is convicted. AAP Copyright © 2020", Mark Russell ,"April 9, 2020"

While the fateful events unfolded slowly and quietly in the cabins, passengers continued to party, enjoying their holiday of a lifetime and, until the end, the cruise company ensured it was business as usual, and life on board went on. While the scale of the disaster that is the Ruby Princess is far greater, and its global context unprecedented in modern times, there are striking similarities with another cruise ship death – that of Brisbane mother Dianne Brimble, who died alone in September 2002 on board the Pacific Sky. Dianne Brimble: A cruise ship tragedy that provides a cautionary tale about leaping to conclusions before a thorough investigation of the Ruby Princess case.  Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. That said, cruise companies are businesses. They know the basic rules of public relations: co-operate with the investigation, apologise, replace the chief executive, all in the hope it will allow survival long enough to start a new chapter. Cruise passenger numbers actually exploded after Brimble’s death, despite the negative publicity. Cruising will likely survive this crisis too. But it is certain there will be other deaths, diseases and tragedies on board cruise ships in the future.The international Cruise Victims Association, represented in Australia by Mark Brimble, Dianne’s former husband, issued a recent statement about the coronavirus crisis six days before the Ruby Princess disembarked its passengers in Sydney. It called on the cruise industry to ""cease the practice of business as usual"" and to suspend its operations in US ports, citing data on the industry’s deficiency in controlling viral outbreaks on ships. “This situation will not be remedied by continuing business as usual,” the ICV said. Hopefully, that’s where the similarities between these two tragedies end, and this police investigation will result in change that disrupts the ""business as usual"" attitude in cruising.

William Allen Corley, from West Ryde, was arrested in January by Australian Federal Police over allegations he made more than 395 transactions to recipients in the Philippines to fund child sex abuse over many years. A Sydney man has been charged with possessing child abuse material and dealing with and producing child pornography material outside Australia. On Tuesday the 63-year-old was granted bail in the NSW Supreme Court after $30,000 was posted by his brother, who the court found to be an ""acceptable person"". The decision by Justice Michael Walton was delivered via a virtual courtroom, as a result of social distancing measures introduced in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Strict bail conditions include surrendering his passport, living at a specified address on the NSW South Coast, reporting daily to Nowra police station and not drinking alcohol or using drugs. He is also not to be in the presence of any child under the age of 16, unless ""in the direct company of another adult,"" nor is he to loiter within 300 meters of any school, childcare, preschool or playground. Mr Corley has been charged with possessing child abuse material and dealing with and producing child pornography material outside Australia. His arrest followed a report alleging he had regularly travelled to the Philippines and was suspected of engaging in criminal offences, most recently in November. During a subsequent raid on his home investigators allegedly located child abuse material and seized smart phones, cameras, travel documents, diaries and handwritten notes allegedly linked to criminal behaviour in the Philippines. Mr Corley is next scheduled to appear at Burwood Local Court on June 3. He is yet to enter a plea. It follows a separate unrelated case of a 52-year-old Melbourne man, who was sentenced last month for the sexual abuse of Filipina minors and the production of child sexual exploitation materials. The man was employed as a commercial international flight attendant and travelled to the Philippines on a regular basis, offending against 26 female children over seven years. He pleaded guilty to more than 30 offences and was sentenced to 18 years' and six months in prison. In another unrelated case this week the AFP also charged western Sydney man Sam Piccinelli, 24, with possessing and sharing almost 7000 files categorised as child abuse material. On Wednesday he pleaded not guilty and was granted strict conditional bail at Penrith Local Court, where he will next appear on June 5.

Mr Dawson, a former Sydney teacher who denies the 1982 murder of his wife Lynette, will put all transcripts of the Teacher's Pet podcast and some of the sound recordings before the court as part of his bid to have the case thrown out. Chris Dawson leaves the Downing Centre Court in February.Credit:Renee Nowytarger The court on Wednesday heard that the alleged contamination includes the effect the popular true-crime podcast had upon key witnesses and potential jurors. One witness came forward after the podcast was published, the court heard. Mr Dawson, 71, also argues the combination of delays in the case coming to trial and the contamination issue leaves him unable to ""adequately defend"" the charge, the court heard. His lawyers also argue Mr Dawson won't get a fair trial before a jury ""because of the way in which the investigation was conducted by the police and the way a de-facto investigation was undertaken by members of the media"". Lynette Dawson's disappearance from her home on Sydney's northern beaches was also the subject of a 2019 book by lawyer Rebecca Hazel. The Crown argues Mr Dawson is overplaying the significance of the impacts of Ms Hazel and the podcast.

Mr Dawson, a former Sydney teacher who denies the 1982 murder of his wife Lynette, will put all transcripts of the Teacher's Pet podcast and some of the sound recordings before the court as part of his bid to have the case thrown out. Chris Dawson leaves the Downing Centre Court in February.Credit:Renee Nowytarger The court on Wednesday heard that the alleged contamination includes the effect the popular true-crime podcast had upon key witnesses and potential jurors. One witness came forward after the podcast was published, the court heard. Mr Dawson, 71, also argues the combination of delays in the case coming to trial and the contamination issue leaves him unable to ""adequately defend"" the charge, the court heard. His lawyers also argue Mr Dawson won't get a fair trial before a jury ""because of the way in which the investigation was conducted by the police and the way a de-facto investigation was undertaken by members of the media"". Lynette Dawson's disappearance from her home on Sydney's northern beaches was also the subject of a 2019 book by lawyer Rebecca Hazel. The Crown argues Mr Dawson is overplaying the significance of the impacts of Ms Hazel and the podcast.

""My husband was in charge of home-schooling our six-year-old son for the day.

""Like Hugh Barrett (C8), I too have been called anti-social,"" writes Robert Silvestrini of Fairfield West. ""I prefer to call myself 'selectively social'."" In a similar vein, the naturally anti-social Peter Skinner of Beecroft had often worried about ""the post-mortem humiliation of no one turning up to my funeral.

35,/national/nsw/roll-with-the-punches-inside-sydney-s-near-empty-schools-20200320-p54c5m.html,'Roll with the punches': Inside Sydney's near-empty schools,"Across NSW, usually bustling schools have turned into ghost towns, as thousands of people follow the Premier's request to keep their children home if they can. For the small groups of teachers and children still meeting in person in the school buildings each day, life is far from normal. Teachers are grappling with unfamiliar technology to support children at home and at school, while diverse classes and year groups are now combined and supervised by a rotating roster of teachers. The NSW Education Department said in-person attendance was down to an average of 9 per cent on Friday - 11 per cent for primary schools and just 3 per cent for high schools. One teacher at a public primary school in the Ku-ring-gai Council area reported 16 children out of 900 still attending on site. Nick Smith picking his son Harper up from school on Friday.Credit:James Brickwood Nick Smith is the father of Harper, 8, a year 3 student still attending his public school near Redfern. ""At this age, their ability to just sort of roll with the punches is really remarkable,"" Mr Smith said. ""He just seems to be getting on with it."" Mr Smith runs a restaurant in Newtown and is trying to keep his 20 employees in work, while his wife Naomi is working shifts. While he had ""misgivings"" about sending Harper to school, he was trying to stay rational and follow the health advice. Mr Smith said Harper had about five children in his class, and seemed to have a different teacher every day, but it was a ""caring and nurturing"" environment and he was doing regular lessons. At many other schools, students at home and school are following the same online learning plans. At Stanmore Public, teachers from each year group are rotating between working from home and supervising the children at school, with everyone doing the same work and connecting via Zoom. Stanmore parents have contributed to a tab for the teachers at Papercup, a cafe across the road, to help keep the business afloat and show appreciation to the teachers. Parents at other schools have made similar gestures, from putting together hampers to setting up snack tables in the staff room. Jeanette, a mother in Ryde, said both her son in year 5 and her daughter in kindergarten were in classes with just four other children. ""Their teachers have been fabulous,"" said Jeanette, who did not want her surname published. ""I asked them straight up what they would prefer and they said that it was my decision to do what works best for our family, but they were honestly happy to have smiling faces to teach."" However, one parent of two children at a small Catholic primary school in the inner west said her child's teacher asked the students to raise their hand if they had a parent working from home and then told them they shouldn't be there. ""It wasn't an isolated thing, it was a message that they're getting every day,"" she said. ""Kids need to be getting a message that they should be there, they're welcome and they're safe."" A teacher at a Catholic high school in the eastern suburbs said 12 out of 870 students were still attending on site and being supervised by a single casual teacher. ""Teachers are mostly all still here ... but it's a bit weird because we keep being told not to all congregate in the staff room but to spread out in classrooms to work,"" she said. ""I don’t really know what the point of us being here is."" A teacher from a Wollongong high school said teachers were working from home four days a week and he felt well supported by the school leadership.

The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said. Universities are not used to manufacturing products, Associate Professor Mukerjee said, but if their prototype equipment was needed and deemed fit for purpose, it was possible for those institutions to scale up. “We need to all think differently and start stepping out of our comfort zone,” she said.

""It's about looking at things differently."" NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback. Dr Blake Cochran, a medical researcher and lecturer at UNSW, said it took just a couple of days to go from talking about potentially creating a face shield prototype to having products ready to test. “I never thought I'd work with industrial designers, it’s a creative approach to things,” he said. The face shields have been the focus of the UNSW team, but Dr Cochran said they would be happy to try designing something else. All it would take, he said, was for hospitals, local health districts or the health department to say “this is exactly what we need”. “Whatever the next need is, we’ve got really good people to help develop solutions,” he said.

NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said while it might be disappointing for people to stay at home, police will be out patrolling highways, country roads and caravan parks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said police will be patrolling back roads and caravan parks to ensure people are adhering to social distancing measures. Credit:Kate Geraghty ""We will be going through caravan parks early, issuing warnings to people that may think they can get around these laws,"" Commissioner Fuller said on Wednesday. ""People will be given one opportunity to pack up, go back to your home state and go back home. Otherwise, we will, unfortunately, have to issue tickets."" Double demerit points will kick in on Thursday morning, but Mr Fuller warned police would also be using number plate recognition and cameras to ensure people are cooperating with authorities' no travel requests, unless they have a good reason. ""We will be using all of our powers and all of our technology to try and identify those people who shouldn't be in NSW,"" he said. Since March 17, police have issued 11 court attendance notices, and 136 penalty infringement notices for breaches of the Public Health Act. Since the last update on Monday, police have fined 15 people, including a man who was sitting at a picnic table at a shopping mall in Mt Druitt on Tuesday.  Police spoke with the 20-year-old and established he had been warned on three separate occasions the day before when he was seen at the same location. He was issued with a $1000 fine. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the tough measures would be reviewed on a monthly basis in line with health advice, but added she didn't want to ""raise expectations"" they could be relaxed by May. ""If the advice in a couple of weeks is that there might be a couple of aspects we can tweak to provide relief to our citizens then we will take that advice,"" she said. Replay   The Premier stressed that relaxing the rules could have serious consequences, and social distancing measures requiring people to remain a safe distance from one another would remain until a vaccine is found. ""Every time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick. More people will die,"" she said. The number of coronavirus cases continues to stabilise in NSW, with 48 new cases confirmed since the last update on Tuesday. The state's total confirmed cases stands at 2734.  The death toll is 21. There are 227 people being treated by NSW Health, including 36 patients in intensive care and 22 of those are ventilated. For businesses, including the Sydney Fish Markets, the Easter long weekend is their busiest time. But this year, people entering the markets will have their temperatures taken and those who are unwell will not be allowed in. Sydney Fish Market chief executive Greg Dyer said about 400 people will be allowed into the markets at any one time, while 150 cars will be allowed in the car park.

Authorities are urging people to stay at home over the Easter break.

""None of us can travel, none of us can go on holidays,"" she said. ""We cannot have communities who currently don't have the virus to get contaminated unintentionally because people are moving around when they shouldn't. ""I know how devastating this is for families who feel that they've been cooped up in their homes, and for people like me, who were looking forward to the holidays."" Ms Berejiklian said social distancing measures will remain amid the coronavirus pandemic until a vaccine is found as the number of new cases continues to stabilise. ""That is the new normal,"" she said. ""Not having physical contact, socially distancing is, at the very minimum, a way of life for us. Because we have to be honest with ourselves - until a vaccine is found, there is no simple way to deal with this issue."" The state's total number of COVID-19 cases stands at 2686, with 49 new cases since the last update on Monday. Of the 229 cases being treated, 37 people are in intensive care with 24 people requiring ventilators. The NSW death toll has risen to 21. Replay   There were 406 locally acquired cases from an unknown source. The Premier said this category is causing health authorities the greatest level of concern. In a bid to tackle the community transmission, NSW Health announced it would expand testing in 13 areas, including Waverley, Ryde, Port Macquarie, Broken Hill and Nowra. For South Coast tourist operators, already devastated by the bushfires, this crisis has increased their financial pressures. Narooma Charters owner Norm Ingersole has been forced to stop his tours but is keeping his tackle shop open for as long as he can to cover rent. Narooma Charters joint owner Norm Ingersole said urging people to stay at home over Easter is the right thing to do.

Following the fires, heavy flooding impacted parts of the South Coast and a few weeks later many businesses were forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. ""We've been flogged,"" Mr Ingersole said. While turning tourists away will worsen Mr Ingersole's financial situation, he said it's the right call. ""We are all supportive of them saying, 'please don't come',"" he said. ""Please save your money up and come out at the end of the lockdown."" But not everyone has heard the advice, with some tourists asking Mr Ingersole to run a private charter or run fishing trips - all of which he has turned down. Deputy Premier John Barilaro urged people to cancel holiday bookings and stay at home over the long weekend. ""My message cannot be clearer, it cannot be simpler. Do not come,"" he said.
