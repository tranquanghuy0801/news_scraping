The Melbourne-based company is working with the University of Queensland and the CSIRO on a potential COVID-19 vaccine which Professor Cuthbertson said on Thursday was on track to go into clinical testing in June. Dr Kong Yuefeng, a recovered COVID-19 patient, donates plasma in the blood centre in Wuhan. Credit:AP Professor Cuthbertson added that it was important to recognise vaccines under development could fail at any stage, and that it would be 12 to 18 months before one could pass clinical trials and be made available to protect the public. The public health measures put in place in the interim were what had kept infections below a level that would overwhelm Australia's healthcare system, he said, and any relaxation had to be done carefully and gradually. ""It would be crazy to just withdraw everything all at once,"" Professor Cuthbertson said. ""It would be a series of careful steps to make sure we don’t have a second wave of infection that would be absolutely devastating and could overwhelm the health system.” The chief executive of ASX-listed regenerative medicine company Mesoblast, Dr Silviu Itescu, backed that sentiment, saying on Thursday that Australians must not become complacent even if a vaccine became available. “This is a viral infection that will stay with us. It’s not going to go away.” Any calls to relax social-distancing laws at this point were misguided, he said. “Over the next two months, this is not the time to be relaxing. I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming.” Professor Cuthbertson said about two-thirds of the population needed to become immune to COVID-19 for it to be contained – preferably by being vaccinated but that also included people who had contracted the virus and then recovered. CSL, the most valuable company on the ASX, said on Thursday that it had put its other clinical trials on hold, and Professor Cuthbertson said it had manufacturing capacity to produce enough vaccine for Australia by the time it passed clinical trials. CSL has also started work on “hyperimmune” therapies for COVID-19 patients at risk of developing critical symptoms or for high-risk individuals such as healthcare workers, made with antibodies harvested from the blood of patients who had contracted and then recovered from COVID-19. Professor Cuthbertson said those therapies could be produced in just a few months, but in smaller quantities than a vaccine given the reliance on collecting blood. He said CSL was talking to Red Cross Lifeblood and the Department of Health about starting to collect blood from convalescent patients. CSL is also working with a global alliance of plasma therapy companies on producing hyperimmune therapies, as well as with American company SAB Therapeutics on harvesting antibodies to tackle COVID-19 from the blood of genetically modified cows.

The $147 billion group's chief executive Paul Perreault told investors on Thursday that plasma collections in March dipped below last year's levels, which would cause ""lumpiness"" in its manufacturing supply chain next year. CSL has reaffirmed its full-year guidance. Credit:Penny Stephens ""What we collect in April will probably put pressure on the system as you look four to five months out from now,"" Mr Perreault told investors. “We just can’t predict where the ebbs and flows will be through the year at this point until we get a better handle on collection.” Mr Perreault said CSL's collection centres in the US could stay open as ""essential infrastructure"" and the company had issued ""safe passage"" letters to ensure blood donors could get to centres, including those who cross the Mexican border to make paid donations. The blood products company has been racing to keep up with demand for plasma products, including immunoglobulin (IG)- used to treat a growing list of rare and chronic medical conditions - which has made it the most valuable company on the ASX. Mr Perreault said the CSL had enough inventory ""for a time"", but continued supply would depend on how long the pandemic and downturn in donations lasts. With health systems around the world strained by COVID-19 cases, CSL said it had put its clinical trials on hiatus, including those for its potential blockbuster heart attack treatment, CSL112. The pause would not materially increase costs or push back the trial time frames, the company said. Before the COVID-19 outbreak wreaked havoc on the world's economy, CSL had increased how much it pays plasma donors in the US in response to a falling unemployment rate. The company cut fees during the global financial crisis in response to a spike in donation numbers. However chief financial officer David Lamont said the group did not expect fees to fall despite the current economic slump, as CSL needed to maintain as much ""foot traffic"" in its centres as possible to bounce back from the supply contraction.   JP Morgan analyst David Low said he was impressed there had so far been no impact on CSL's sales from the pandemic. ""There is no supply issue today, but there could be in six to nine months,"" he said. ""We're still very encouraged."" Mr Perreault said the pandemic had caused a further jump in demand for IG products, which can boost patients' immune systems, and the company was also seeing higher demand for its influenza vaccine heading into the southern hemisphere winter. Mr Lamont said that CSL was well-placed to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 but it was too early to say what kind of upside there could be for group if any of its treatments were successful. “Yes we think we’re well placed given our background.... [but] we don’t know if we have a product yet,” he said. CSL reaffirmed its full-year guidance for profit of between $2.11 billion and $2.17 billion.

Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the health crisis. Virgin will only fly one return service between Sydney and Melbourne a day. Credit:Edwina Pickles The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin will continue to operate government-funded international flights to bring stranded Australians home and charter flights. “As a result of government restrictions, less people are travelling and we have made changes to our schedules to reflect this,” a Virgin spokesman said in a statement. “We continue to operate a daily service between Melbourne and Sydney, provide cargo transport locally and overseas, and operate charter flights including assisting the government in bringing Australians home.” Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Qantas is also operating a significantly reduced domestic network, and is flying Sydney to Melbourne only five times a week compared to 50 times a day before the pandemic. Qantas continues to operate to each capital city and 25 regional destinations, however, at reduced frequencies. It said on Thursday it was set to carry 95 per cent fewer passengers this Easter compared to last year.

6,/business/markets/asx-surges-in-late-trade-to-close-at-one-month-high-20200409-p54ihn.html,ASX surges in late trade to close at one-month high,"That's it for the Markets Live blog for the week. While it's unlikely to be the same as previous years in this era of social distancing, I hope you enjoy a safe and relaxing Easter break.  I'll return on Tuesday to do it all again. Look forward to seeing you all then. Scutty. Australian shares rallied hard into the Easter long weekend, helped by strong gains on Wall Street, a continued decline in new coronavirus cases domestically and a resurgence in companies that were among the hardest hit hardest during the market rout in March. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 jumped 180.4 points, or 3.5 per cent, to 5387.3, closing at the highest level since March 13. Thursday’s increase left the weekly advance at 6.3 per cent, extending the rebound from the multi-year lows hit in March to 22.4 per cent. “While Australian banks were hit on talk of dividend suspensions, Australian shares saw good gains, helped by the strong global lead with particularly solid gains in property and energy shares,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital. Despite the impressive rebound, Dr Oliver cautioned the move may still reverse as quickly as it occurred. “Shares have had a great rally from the lows in March but it’s still too early to say we have seen the bottom given the uncertainty around the coronavirus both in terms of the outbreak’s duration and its economic impact,” he said. Despite heightened uncertainty, Dr Oliver said shares are likely to see good total returns over the next 12-months, helped by an eventual pick-up in economic activity and policy stimulus. All sectors finished higher on Thursday, led by gains in excess of 5 per cent for industrials and REITs. Notably, many of the sectors that outperformed were among the hardest hit during the recent market rout, a theme that was also evident in the top performing stocks during the session. Mining services firm Perenti Global led the gains, surging 27.6 per cent to $0.785. Media stocks were also in demand with oOh! Media jumping 19.7 per cent to $0.76 on news that Here, There & Everywhere had acquired a stake in the company, leading to speculation over a possible takeover. Southern Cross Media also gained 18.2 per cent to $0.13. Boral, Transurban, Afterpay and Super Retail Group – among the hardest hit last month on the benchmark – also posted gains in excess of 10 per cent for the session. The recent steepening of Australia’s yield curve (see earlier post) partially explains why the Aussie dollar currently sits at one-month highs, according to ANZ Bank’s head of FX research Daniel Been. “The recent squeeze in the AUD has been sharp, with the currency rebounding 12 per cent from its low, a bigger move than the whole of 2019,” Mr Been wrote. “Interestingly, interest rates have been important, particularly the shape of the curve rather than absolute spreads. The RBA’s decision to enact yield curve control (YCC) at the three-year sector of the curve, while leaving the longer end of the curve to be more market dependent, may have contributed some strength to the AUD.” Along with the steepening of Australia’s yield curve, Mr Been said the movements in emerging market currencies, equities and volatility have also been “clear drivers” in determining the Aussie dollar’s recent performance. Macquarie Research remains bullish towards Australia’s listed iron ore miners despite prices for hot rolled coil – predominantly used in manufacturing - coming under pressure in recent days. “The trend year-to-date has been negative with rebar prices (largely used in construction) down 6 per cent while HRC prices are down 14 per cent,” Macquarie said. “The weakening HRC price has pushed margins down from $US30 per tonne at the beginning of March to negative $US8 per tonne currently. Rebar margins have remained more robust, rising marginally from $US35 per tonne at the start of March to $US40 per tonne currently.” Despite downward pressure on some steel product prices and a huge surge in Australian iron ore exports to China during March, spot iron ore prices remain rock solid with benchmark 62 per cent fines rising 1.1 per cent to $US83.65 per tonne overnight, according to Fastmarkets at MB. Given the resilient price performance, Macquarie says earnings at iron ore miners remain strong. “We retain our positive view on the iron-ore miners with FMG, RIO, BHP and MGX all boasting free cashflow yields of more than 10 per cent at spot price,” it said. A nationwide collapse in consumer spending caused by the coronavirus outbreak was arrested last week as new real-time economic data shows pensioners and social security recipients used a one-off $750 stimulus payment to buy much more than usual. Spending plummeted in late March to be 13 per cent below normal but recovered to be 5 per cent below the norm last week, a database that tracks the consumption patterns of hundreds of thousands of Australians shows. Between March 30 and April 5, demand across much of the economy was supported by lower income people, who were the main recipients of the federal government's stimulus payment. But higher income earners, who mostly didn’t receive it, continued to cut back. In supermarkets last week spending was up 19 per cent among lower income consumers but fell by 3 per cent among higher income shoppers. Demand for discretionary goods and services were 26 per cent lower than normal levels in late March but bounced back to 16 per cent below the norm last week. Matt has more here on the useful information here.  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is expected to have increased sharply again last week, albeit below the record levels seen in the previous week. According to those polled by Reuters, the median economist forecast looks for initial jobless claims to lift by an additional 5.25 million, down from 6.65 million seven days earlier. Individual forecasts range from an increase of anywhere between 2.5 million to as much as 9.295 million workers. Economists at Morgan Stanley forecast claims will rise by 5.62 million, setting the stage for unemployment to hit unprecedented levels in the coming months. “A reading in this order of magnitude would bring the total number of claims submitted within the previous three-week period to about 16 million, corresponding to an equivalent of more than 10 percentage points increase in the unemployment rate,” the investment bank said in a note. “Our forecast envisages a record high average unemployment rate for the US economy of 15.7 per cent in the June quarter with the monthly peak at 16.4 per cent in May.” Shares in regional lender Bank of Queensland remain pressured after releasing its first half results yesterday, falling a further 1 per cent to $4.98. The decline, at odds with the moves seen in the big four banks today, coincides with a price target downgrade from analysts at Macquarie Research. “While BOQ appears reasonably valued on the headline basis trading at around a 55 per cent discount to the all industrials ex banks, we remain cautious until the outlook regarding COVID-19 impacts clears up,” the investment bank said. Reflecting that view, Macquarie cut its price target for BOQ to $5.00 while retaining a neutral rating. Separately, analysts at Goldman Sachs are also neutral rated on the stock, albeit with a slightly higher target of $5.51. Citi Research is more optimistic, maintaining a buy on BoQ and price target of $6.50. Less than three weeks after announcing it will begin purchasing Australian and semi-government bonds as part of its yield curve control program, there’s already signs the RBA is beginning to taper the size of asset purchases. Having bought around $2 billion worth of bonds in recent weeks, the RBA announced it would only purchase $1.5 billion in government securities today. “We are surprised by this,” ANZ Bank’s rates strategy team said in a note. “We had expected the RBA to maintain its purchases at $2 billion for a few more weeks, though with a reduction in the number of purchases to four per week.” ANZ believes the reduced buying may indicate the RBA is satisfied with the shape of the yield curve and the spread between Australian and semi bond yields, even with recent steepening (the difference between longer and shorter-dated yields getting larger). “Today’s reduction presumably means that conditions have improved sufficiently to allow the reduction announced today,” ANZ said. Even with the reduction in asset purchases, ANZ says this is still sufficient to mop up increased debt issuance from various Australian government borrowing entities. “If it continues over 4-5 days per week then it is a level that means the RBA is buying the equivalent of most of the new supply, if not more,” it said. “This is not something we expect to continue over the longer-term.” The RBA is currently targeting Australian three-year yields around 0.25 per cent, around the level they sit today. Benchmark 10-year ACGBs currently yield 1.025 per cent. The shape of the yield curve influences borrowing costs for not only governments but also corporates, along with other asset classes such as equities and currencies.   The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. Stephen's full opinion piece is found here.  The tentative optimism in parts of Europe and the US about a turning point in the rate of coronavirus infection is encouraging more people to start thinking about how and when to restart economies. It is a crucial and complex issue involving an unusual range of risks, uncertainties, difficult judgments and trade-offs. I certainly don't have an easy answer, and neither do people I talk to whom I respect greatly. With a view to generating ideas, how about collectively engaging in the following thought exercise? Imagine you, as the leader of a liberal democracy, have to make the decision based on the following conversation among three sets of experts - which, for simplicity, we will aggregate into a single expert each on health, the economy and social behaviour. You can read the responses, and counter responses, of which there are many, here.  Copyright © 2020", David Scutt ,"April 9, 2020"

In supermarkets last week spending was up 19 per cent among lower income consumers but fell by 3 per cent among higher income shoppers. Demand for discretionary goods and services were 26 per cent lower than normal levels in late March but bounced back to 16 per cent below the norm last week. Matt has more here on the useful information here.  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is expected to have increased sharply again last week, albeit below the record levels seen in the previous week. According to those polled by Reuters, the median economist forecast looks for initial jobless claims to lift by an additional 5.25 million, down from 6.65 million seven days earlier. Individual forecasts range from an increase of anywhere between 2.5 million to as much as 9.295 million workers. Economists at Morgan Stanley forecast claims will rise by 5.62 million, setting the stage for unemployment to hit unprecedented levels in the coming months. “A reading in this order of magnitude would bring the total number of claims submitted within the previous three-week period to about 16 million, corresponding to an equivalent of more than 10 percentage points increase in the unemployment rate,” the investment bank said in a note. “Our forecast envisages a record high average unemployment rate for the US economy of 15.7 per cent in the June quarter with the monthly peak at 16.4 per cent in May.” Shares in regional lender Bank of Queensland remain pressured after releasing its first half results yesterday, falling a further 1 per cent to $4.98. The decline, at odds with the moves seen in the big four banks today, coincides with a price target downgrade from analysts at Macquarie Research. “While BOQ appears reasonably valued on the headline basis trading at around a 55 per cent discount to the all industrials ex banks, we remain cautious until the outlook regarding COVID-19 impacts clears up,” the investment bank said. Reflecting that view, Macquarie cut its price target for BOQ to $5.00 while retaining a neutral rating. Separately, analysts at Goldman Sachs are also neutral rated on the stock, albeit with a slightly higher target of $5.51. Citi Research is more optimistic, maintaining a buy on BoQ and price target of $6.50. Less than three weeks after announcing it will begin purchasing Australian and semi-government bonds as part of its yield curve control program, there’s already signs the RBA is beginning to taper the size of asset purchases. Having bought around $2 billion worth of bonds in recent weeks, the RBA announced it would only purchase $1.5 billion in government securities today. “We are surprised by this,” ANZ Bank’s rates strategy team said in a note. “We had expected the RBA to maintain its purchases at $2 billion for a few more weeks, though with a reduction in the number of purchases to four per week.” ANZ believes the reduced buying may indicate the RBA is satisfied with the shape of the yield curve and the spread between Australian and semi bond yields, even with recent steepening (the difference between longer and shorter-dated yields getting larger). “Today’s reduction presumably means that conditions have improved sufficiently to allow the reduction announced today,” ANZ said. Even with the reduction in asset purchases, ANZ says this is still sufficient to mop up increased debt issuance from various Australian government borrowing entities. “If it continues over 4-5 days per week then it is a level that means the RBA is buying the equivalent of most of the new supply, if not more,” it said. “This is not something we expect to continue over the longer-term.” The RBA is currently targeting Australian three-year yields around 0.25 per cent, around the level they sit today. Benchmark 10-year ACGBs currently yield 1.025 per cent. The shape of the yield curve influences borrowing costs for not only governments but also corporates, along with other asset classes such as equities and currencies.   The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. Stephen's full opinion piece is found here.  The tentative optimism in parts of Europe and the US about a turning point in the rate of coronavirus infection is encouraging more people to start thinking about how and when to restart economies. It is a crucial and complex issue involving an unusual range of risks, uncertainties, difficult judgments and trade-offs. I certainly don't have an easy answer, and neither do people I talk to whom I respect greatly. With a view to generating ideas, how about collectively engaging in the following thought exercise? Imagine you, as the leader of a liberal democracy, have to make the decision based on the following conversation among three sets of experts - which, for simplicity, we will aggregate into a single expert each on health, the economy and social behaviour. You can read the responses, and counter responses, of which there are many, here.  Copyright © 2020", David Scutt ,"April 9, 2020"

The company said in an ASX statement on Thursday morning it that ""all other terms of sale are unchanged"" as it confirmed a revised completion date of May 1 for the sale of Pacific Magazines. New Idea is part of the Pacific Magazines stable and will be part of Bauer Media should the deal go ahead. Bauer Media's takeover of the New Idea and WHO publisher was expected to be completed today after the deal was cleared by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on March 26, but tough advertising marketing conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic caused the German family-owned business to review the transaction and consider cutting further staff or a renegotiation of the sale price. Seven's Pacific Magazines filed a court case with the NSW Supreme Court to compel the completion of the sale, as concerns were raised Bauer Media was not in a financially viable position to complete the deal. The two companies are due in court on April 17. Seven said yesterday that the contract is unconditional and Bauer solicitors were ""aware"" of their obligations under the agreement, but it is unclear whether Bauer Media informed the broadcaster of its intention to default on the deal. Industry sources said the German publishing giant had been looking to renegotiate as current market conditions had significantly reduced the value of Pacific. Bauer Media last week suspended the use of freelance journalists and halted staff expense claims, while its German parent company decided to close its New Zealand magazine operations. Multiple industry sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity last week expressed concern the publisher of Australian Women's Weekly and Woman's Day could be put into administration to avoid going through with the purchase, or be forced to shut down multiple titles if it couldn't renegotiate the price. Sources familiar with the transaction have said there is no financial guarantee by Bauer Media's parent company, Heinrich Bauer Verlag KG. The Bauer family, which owns Bauer Media, had been looking to exit the Australian market late last year and was in discussions with private equity firm Mercury Capital about a transaction. The deal is important for the Australian magazine industry, which has faced fierce competition from online platforms. But the transaction is also significant to Seven, as it will help reduce its net debt pile of half a billion dollars. Seven had been trying to sell off a range of assets, including Seven Studios and Seven Digital Ventures, before the COVID-19 crisis. But the pandemic forced the company to withdraw its earnings forecasts late last month and told staff last week to take a 20 per cent pay cut until the end of the financial year.

Australia’s number-two carrier had previously cut its network to 10 per cent of its normal schedule as it comes under significant financial pressure due to the health crisis. Virgin will only fly one return service between Sydney and Melbourne a day. Credit:Edwina Pickles The almost entire grounding of Virgin's network takes effect from Friday, with all other domestic flights through to June 15 cancelled. Virgin will continue to operate government-funded international flights to bring stranded Australians home and charter flights. “As a result of government restrictions, less people are travelling and we have made changes to our schedules to reflect this,” a Virgin spokesman said in a statement. “We continue to operate a daily service between Melbourne and Sydney, provide cargo transport locally and overseas, and operate charter flights including assisting the government in bringing Australians home.” Virgin has stood down around 8000 of its 10,000 workers and has asked government for a $1.4 billion loan to ensure it can survive the coronavirus shutdown. Qantas is also operating a significantly reduced domestic network, and is flying Sydney to Melbourne only five times a week compared to 50 times a day before the pandemic. Qantas continues to operate to each capital city and 25 regional destinations, however, at reduced frequencies. It said on Thursday it was set to carry 95 per cent fewer passengers this Easter compared to last year. ""We’ve further cut our domestic flights because of various travel restrictions and their impact on demand,"" a Qantas spokesman said. ""Earlier this week we had some flights with only a handful of passengers on board,which just isn’t sustainable."" The larger airline has stood down around 20,000 workers. Federal Transport Minister Michael McCormack said on Thursday he acknowledged Qantas and Virgin had ""significantly reduced their domestic and international services"", and that he continued to ""talk to airline executives on a regular basis as we navigate this unprecedented situation"". The government has so far announced close to $1 billion in support for the aviation industry, consisting of waived fees and levies and including $300 million just for regional operators.

Dr Kong Yuefeng, a recovered COVID-19 patient, donates plasma in the blood centre in Wuhan. Credit:AP Professor Cuthbertson added that it was important to recognise vaccines under development could fail at any stage, and that it would be 12 to 18 months before one could pass clinical trials and be made available to protect the public. The public health measures put in place in the interim were what had kept infections below a level that would overwhelm Australia's healthcare system, he said, and any relaxation had to be done carefully and gradually. ""It would be crazy to just withdraw everything all at once,"" Professor Cuthbertson said. ""It would be a series of careful steps to make sure we don’t have a second wave of infection that would be absolutely devastating and could overwhelm the health system.” The chief executive of ASX-listed regenerative medicine company Mesoblast, Dr Silviu Itescu, backed that sentiment, saying on Thursday that Australians must not become complacent even if a vaccine became available. “This is a viral infection that will stay with us.

CSL has also started work on “hyperimmune” therapies for COVID-19 patients at risk of developing critical symptoms or for high-risk individuals such as healthcare workers, made with antibodies harvested from the blood of patients who had contracted and then recovered from COVID-19. Professor Cuthbertson said those therapies could be produced in just a few months, but in smaller quantities than a vaccine given the reliance on collecting blood. He said CSL was talking to Red Cross Lifeblood and the Department of Health about starting to collect blood from convalescent patients.

The electronics retailer refused to comment but their website said no more than 100 people, including staff, were allowed in stores at one time, depending on the size of the outlet. ""Which seems to me to be crazy because if you can't have more than five people at a wedding, how can you have 100 people indoors?"" the staff membersaid. The JB Hi-Fi staff member said she was becoming more and more distressed as time went on. ""I'm grateful to have a job, don't get me wrong. But it gets to a point where [you ask] 'Is our safety being prioritised over sales?', and to be honest I don't think it is. ""We are scared and desperate. Our business is doing the bare minimum of the government regulations, but as long as they continue to make money we will be put at risk."" A spokesman for the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) said they had repeatedly met with JB Hi-Fi management after staff members contacted them with concerns.

Workers at other stores said they felt that while their employers were trying to address health and safety, customers were not abiding by social distancing. ""They walk right up to me as I back away, they pay with cash and touch everything, sneeze and wipe their nose on their hands and touch things,"" said one supermarket worker. ""I have to keep reminding people to space out at the register."" A pregnant woman who works in a popular furniture store said ""the amount of people who come too close to me is insane"". ""Every day me and my child's life is on the line so ignorant people can shop for things that are absolutely not essential."" Other major electronic stores have also been busy as people stock up in order to stay home. An Officeworks spokeswoman declined to comment on whether it has had complaints from workers about health and safety issues. However in a statement earlier this month, the company said it had taken steps including banning the use of cash and in some stores limiting how many people can be inside at one time. Consumer electronic retail store The Good Guys also did not respond to a request for comment but have introduced similar measures in store. Safe Work Australia has advised large retailers to calculate their floor space and set an upper limit on customers who may be inside the premises at one time. They've also been told to mark floors to enforce social distancing, use separate doors for entry and exits and to go cashless. Large retailers have also been advised to consult with workers about the risks of working and to rotate tasks to ensure minimal contact with customers.

Boral, Transurban, Afterpay and Super Retail Group – among the hardest hit last month on the benchmark – also posted gains in excess of 10 per cent for the session. The recent steepening of Australia’s yield curve (see earlier post) partially explains why the Aussie dollar currently sits at one-month highs, according to ANZ Bank’s head of FX research Daniel Been. “The recent squeeze in the AUD has been sharp, with the currency rebounding 12 per cent from its low, a bigger move than the whole of 2019,” Mr Been wrote. “Interestingly, interest rates have been important, particularly the shape of the curve rather than absolute spreads. The RBA’s decision to enact yield curve control (YCC) at the three-year sector of the curve, while leaving the longer end of the curve to be more market dependent, may have contributed some strength to the AUD.” Along with the steepening of Australia’s yield curve, Mr Been said the movements in emerging market currencies, equities and volatility have also been “clear drivers” in determining the Aussie dollar’s recent performance. Macquarie Research remains bullish towards Australia’s listed iron ore miners despite prices for hot rolled coil – predominantly used in manufacturing - coming under pressure in recent days. “The trend year-to-date has been negative with rebar prices (largely used in construction) down 6 per cent while HRC prices are down 14 per cent,” Macquarie said. “The weakening HRC price has pushed margins down from $US30 per tonne at the beginning of March to negative $US8 per tonne currently. Rebar margins have remained more robust, rising marginally from $US35 per tonne at the start of March to $US40 per tonne currently.” Despite downward pressure on some steel product prices and a huge surge in Australian iron ore exports to China during March, spot iron ore prices remain rock solid with benchmark 62 per cent fines rising 1.1 per cent to $US83.65 per tonne overnight, according to Fastmarkets at MB. Given the resilient price performance, Macquarie says earnings at iron ore miners remain strong. “We retain our positive view on the iron-ore miners with FMG, RIO, BHP and MGX all boasting free cashflow yields of more than 10 per cent at spot price,” it said. A nationwide collapse in consumer spending caused by the coronavirus outbreak was arrested last week as new real-time economic data shows pensioners and social security recipients used a one-off $750 stimulus payment to buy much more than usual. Spending plummeted in late March to be 13 per cent below normal but recovered to be 5 per cent below the norm last week, a database that tracks the consumption patterns of hundreds of thousands of Australians shows. Between March 30 and April 5, demand across much of the economy was supported by lower income people, who were the main recipients of the federal government's stimulus payment. But higher income earners, who mostly didn’t receive it, continued to cut back. In supermarkets last week spending was up 19 per cent among lower income consumers but fell by 3 per cent among higher income shoppers. Demand for discretionary goods and services were 26 per cent lower than normal levels in late March but bounced back to 16 per cent below the norm last week. Matt has more here on the useful information here.  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits is expected to have increased sharply again last week, albeit below the record levels seen in the previous week. According to those polled by Reuters, the median economist forecast looks for initial jobless claims to lift by an additional 5.25 million, down from 6.65 million seven days earlier. Individual forecasts range from an increase of anywhere between 2.5 million to as much as 9.295 million workers. Economists at Morgan Stanley forecast claims will rise by 5.62 million, setting the stage for unemployment to hit unprecedented levels in the coming months. “A reading in this order of magnitude would bring the total number of claims submitted within the previous three-week period to about 16 million, corresponding to an equivalent of more than 10 percentage points increase in the unemployment rate,” the investment bank said in a note. “Our forecast envisages a record high average unemployment rate for the US economy of 15.7 per cent in the June quarter with the monthly peak at 16.4 per cent in May.” Shares in regional lender Bank of Queensland remain pressured after releasing its first half results yesterday, falling a further 1 per cent to $4.98. The decline, at odds with the moves seen in the big four banks today, coincides with a price target downgrade from analysts at Macquarie Research. “While BOQ appears reasonably valued on the headline basis trading at around a 55 per cent discount to the all industrials ex banks, we remain cautious until the outlook regarding COVID-19 impacts clears up,” the investment bank said. Reflecting that view, Macquarie cut its price target for BOQ to $5.00 while retaining a neutral rating. Separately, analysts at Goldman Sachs are also neutral rated on the stock, albeit with a slightly higher target of $5.51. Citi Research is more optimistic, maintaining a buy on BoQ and price target of $6.50. Less than three weeks after announcing it will begin purchasing Australian and semi-government bonds as part of its yield curve control program, there’s already signs the RBA is beginning to taper the size of asset purchases. Having bought around $2 billion worth of bonds in recent weeks, the RBA announced it would only purchase $1.5 billion in government securities today. “We are surprised by this,” ANZ Bank’s rates strategy team said in a note. “We had expected the RBA to maintain its purchases at $2 billion for a few more weeks, though with a reduction in the number of purchases to four per week.” ANZ believes the reduced buying may indicate the RBA is satisfied with the shape of the yield curve and the spread between Australian and semi bond yields, even with recent steepening (the difference between longer and shorter-dated yields getting larger). “Today’s reduction presumably means that conditions have improved sufficiently to allow the reduction announced today,” ANZ said. Even with the reduction in asset purchases, ANZ says this is still sufficient to mop up increased debt issuance from various Australian government borrowing entities. “If it continues over 4-5 days per week then it is a level that means the RBA is buying the equivalent of most of the new supply, if not more,” it said. “This is not something we expect to continue over the longer-term.” The RBA is currently targeting Australian three-year yields around 0.25 per cent, around the level they sit today. Benchmark 10-year ACGBs currently yield 1.025 per cent. The shape of the yield curve influences borrowing costs for not only governments but also corporates, along with other asset classes such as equities and currencies.   The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. Stephen's full opinion piece is found here.  The tentative optimism in parts of Europe and the US about a turning point in the rate of coronavirus infection is encouraging more people to start thinking about how and when to restart economies. It is a crucial and complex issue involving an unusual range of risks, uncertainties, difficult judgments and trade-offs. I certainly don't have an easy answer, and neither do people I talk to whom I respect greatly. With a view to generating ideas, how about collectively engaging in the following thought exercise? Imagine you, as the leader of a liberal democracy, have to make the decision based on the following conversation among three sets of experts - which, for simplicity, we will aggregate into a single expert each on health, the economy and social behaviour. You can read the responses, and counter responses, of which there are many, here.  Copyright © 2020", David Scutt ,"April 9, 2020"
23,/business/markets/8-eight-wall-street-surges-higher-as-rally-rolls-on-20200409-p54ih0.html,8@eight: Wall Street surges higher as rally rolls on,"Investors were in a bullish mood on Wall Street, sending indexes surging higher, with healthcare shares jumping after Bernie Sanders exited the presidential race. It sets up the ASX for gains this morning, with futures at  7.30am AEST pointing to a gain of 70 points, or 1.4 per cent, at the open. 1. US stocks rally, as traders prep for long weekend: US stocks have surged overnight, with the S&P500 climbing 3.4 per cent. It was a day of low volume and liquidity was scarcer. But rather than a true indication of a lack of conviction behind this rally, it’s likely attributable in large part to a thinning out of market participants ahead of the Passover and Easter holidays in the next few days. Wall Street welcomed the exit of Bernie Sanders from the presidential race.Credit:AP Market breadth was a considerable 95 per cent for the index, with utilities and energy stocks topping the sectoral map. 2. US  sharemarket looking bullish: The S&P500 is now 23 per cent higher than it was when it recorded its low on March 23. This latest leg-up for US stocks, which is starting to take shape as a little more than a bear-market rally, came after the release of the accounts for the last US Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed delivered little substantial new information. But reassured, in effect, that it sees rates at effectively 0 per cent until the COVID-19 crisis passes, and that it has capacity to increase its asset purchases, if necessary. 3. Sharemarket recovery rubber stamped by Fed: That capacity to keep expanding its balance sheet, along with its willingness to lend directly into the market, has seemingly underpinned the recovery in sharemarkets. The US sharemarket’s bottom coincided with the Fed’s pledge of so-called “unlimited” quantitative easing to support US financial conditions. Despite the potential for a Great Depression-like downturn in the US economy, and its deleterious impact of company earnings, the flow of capital into financial markets, and subsequently into stocks, like before the crisis, is fuelling a surge in risk-taking. 4. Europe suffering same old problems: The night’s trade for European equities proved not so bullish. Though a recovery was staged at the back end of European trade, the continent’s equities fell after EU finance ministers failed to nut-out an appropriate fiscal support package for the region. The Euro lagged the G10 currency space, European bond spreads widened, and the DAX dropped 0.23 per cent, as some of the animus between Northern and European states has seemingly, once again, complicated that matter of what shape stimulus ought to take. 5. USD higher, but it was a night for risk in FX: Weakness in the Euro kept the US Dollar well bid, as signs of tighter Dollar liquidity, along with chatter about another $US500b fiscal stimulus plan in the US, kept the Dollar Index in positive territory. It was day, in the end, for high-beta currencies, however. The Australia Dollar swung wildly, but eventually finished 1 per cent higher for the day, after ratings agency S&P put Australian sovereign debt on negative watch. While the GBP lifted after it was reported UK PM Boris Johnson’s condition is improving in ICU. 6. Oil prices in focus: The CAD didn’t catch the risk on memo, as oil markets remain in focus. Oil prices did rally considerably last night, with WTI Crude surging another 10 per cent, as traders prepare for OPEC+’s teleconference to discuss potential production cuts. Markets are placing faith in the cartel that economic rationalism will lead its members to cooperate. It comes as last night’s US crude inventory data showed a build in US stockpiles of 15.2 million barrels – its biggest build in the data’s recorded history. 7. ASX200 to open higher: For Wall Street’s strong lead, SPI Futures are implying a 1.35 per cent rally for the ASX200 at the open this morning. It follows what was a soft day’s trade, in which the local index shed 0.86 per cent. The market was dragged lower by bank stocks, after APRA (tacitly) recommended that ADIs reduced or cut dividends in order to stabilise the financial system. It was a day of broad-based losses otherwise, with all but consumer discretionary and real estate stocks finishing higher. 8.

24,/business/the-economy/early-access-to-super-must-target-the-most-needy-20200409-h1n9uw.html,Early access to super must target the most needy,"At a time when tens of thousands of people are desperately short of money because of the coronavirus crisis, one obvious source of funds is the $3 trillion pool of superannuation savings. While, in theory, that money is supposed to be kept to fund retirement in the future, the government has announced it will allow people to access their savings early if they need it to put food on the table and pay the rent now. People who meet new relaxed criteria of financial hardship will be able to take out up to $20,000 over the next six months. Former Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd has proposed an even more liberal approach, arguing that people should have the option of taking the 9.5 per cent of wages earmarked for compulsory superannuation contributions as cash over the next six months. In the financial world, however, simple solutions can often have unforeseen, indirect consequences and superannuation investors should not take their money out without thinking it through. Because of the recent falls in the sharemarket anyone who takes their money out now will receive as much as 30 per cent less than their account was worth two months ago. That will be their choice and it might prove a reasonable trade-off, but it comes at a cost. Taking a thousand dollars out now will mean they receive many thousands of dollars less in retirement. Industry superannuation funds have also warned that in giving early access they must take into account the interests of the other people with money still invested in their funds and the broader economy. If super funds have to sell shares at once, it will tend to push down share prices, which means all fund members’ account balances will be hit. All superannuation funds are required to keep cash on hand to meet these sorts of emergencies, which will probably mean funds will have cash on hand to meet a rush of withdrawals. But the Reserve Bank of Australia, in its twice yearly Financial Stability Report published on Thursday, pointed out that some super funds with lots of young members working in industries heavily affected by the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, will face a “large liquidity drain”. With less cash, funds could miss out on opportunities to pick up shares at bargain prices, leaving all members worse off, once markets recover. This poses a dilemma for superannuation funds and some say they will have to apply some type of charge for early withdrawals to compensate. Given all those risks, the government’s scheme probably strikes a fair balance between allowing early access to superannuation to the most desperate on the one hand and protecting long-term members and the economy on the other. The Australian Tax Office has just issued detailed criteria. That does not seem to be the case for Mr Shepherd’s proposal of an opt-out from the 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee as it could put cash in the pockets of everyone regardless of need. Superannuation has a role to play in protecting Australians from the looming economic crisis but the government must also protect the integrity of the retirement system which is a major engine of investment in the economy.

26,/business/the-economy/early-access-to-super-must-target-the-most-needy-20200409-p54iok.html,Early access to super must target the most needy,"At a time when tens of thousands of people are desperately short of money because of the coronavirus crisis, one obvious source of funds is the $3 trillion pool of superannuation savings. While, in theory, that money is supposed to be kept to fund retirement in the future, the government has announced it will allow people to access their savings early if they need it to put food on the table and pay the rent now. People who meet new relaxed criteria of financial hardship will be able to take out up to $20,000 over the next six months. Former Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd has proposed an even more liberal approach, arguing that people should have the option of taking the 9.5 per cent of wages earmarked for compulsory superannuation contributions as cash over the next six months. In the financial world, however, simple solutions can often have unforeseen, indirect consequences and superannuation investors should not take their money out without thinking it through. Because of the recent falls in the sharemarket anyone who takes their money out now will receive as much as 30 per cent less than their account was worth two months ago. That will be their choice and it might prove a reasonable trade-off, but it comes at a cost. Taking a thousand dollars out now will mean they receive many thousands of dollars less in retirement. Industry superannuation funds have also warned that in giving early access they must take into account the interests of the other people with money still invested in their funds and the broader economy. If super funds have to sell shares at once, it will tend to push down share prices, which means all fund members’ account balances will be hit. All superannuation funds are required to keep  cash on hand to meet these sorts of emergencies, which will probably mean funds will have cash on hand to meet a rush of withdrawals. But the Reserve Bank of Australia, in its twice yearly Financial Stability Report published on Thursday, pointed out that some super funds with lots of young members working in industries heavily affected by the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, will face a “large liquidity drain”. With less cash, funds could miss out on opportunities to pick up shares at bargain prices, leaving all members worse off, once markets recover. This poses a dilemma for superannuation funds and some say they will have to apply some type of charge for early withdrawals to compensate. Given all those risks, the government’s scheme probably strikes a fair balance between allowing early access to superannuation to the most desperate on the one hand and protecting long-term members and the economy on the other.

27,/business/the-economy/pandemic-could-push-half-a-billion-into-poverty-report-20200409-p54ih5.html,Pandemic could push half a billion into poverty: report,"Extreme poverty in Australia's immediate region is set to skyrocket as the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak reverses decades of progress among the world’s most disadvantaged communities. Half-a-billion people in developing countries — about 8 per cent of the global population — could be pushed into poverty by the pandemic, a new study by United Nations University’s World Institute for Development Economics Research  says. A child in Papua New Guinea receives a polio vaccine. The coronavirus outbreak threatens to reverse decades of global progress in alleviating poverty.Credit:Louise Kennerley  One of the co-authors, Christopher Hoy, from the Australian National University,  said poverty rates in many of Australia's neighbours, including Indonesia, were set to rise dramatically. “Indonesia has made huge progress at reducing extreme poverty but a large share of the population still lives just above the poverty line and are vulnerable to falling back,” he said. Mr Hoy estimates a 10 per cent contraction in income per person in Indonesia would increase the share of people in extreme poverty by 50 per cent, while a 20 per cent contraction in income per person would more than double the share of people in extreme poverty.

Credit:Getty Images Near neighbours Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste already have very high rates of extreme poverty, and Mr Hoy said the economic consequences of the pandemic was “just going to make their living standards worse”. It was in Australia’s interests to assist developing countries respond to the health emergency and its long-term economic fallout, he said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday about co-ordinated action by the two countries to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The two … discussed the importance of a strong international response to the outbreak in the region, including in south-east Asia,"" Mr Pompeo’s spokesperson said. Mr Morrison tweeted after the call indicating the joint efforts would include ""both health and economic, & the need to keep supply chains open"". The report warns that in the Middle East, north Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the adverse impacts of COVID-19 could result in poverty levels similar to those recorded 30 years ago. Replay   Since 1990, the share of people living below the extreme poverty line (set at $US1.90, or $3, per day in purchasing parity terms) has fallen from about 36 per cent of the world’s population to fewer than 10 per cent. But the pandemic will interrupt decades of progress in poverty alleviation. A man washes his hands to curb the spread of the new coronavirus in Juba, South Sudan. South Sudan announced its first case of COVID-19 on Sunday, making it the 51st of Africa's 54 countries to report the disease.Credit:AP The report warns that “non-monetary” indicators in developing countries “will also be seriously hit”, including infant mortality, maternal mortality and malnourishment. “The severity of the effects will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and on how the national governments and the international community reacts,” it said. The study estimates how much global poverty levels will rise should there be a 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent decline in per capita consumption in developing countries. Under the 20 per cent scenario, the number of people living in poverty worldwide would increase by 420–580 million, relative to the latest figures. Andy Sumner, one of the report's co-authors from King's College London, said he was surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty that could follow in developing countries. “Even a small consumption shock could throw millions of people into poverty,” he said. “Our findings point towards the importance of a dramatic expansion of social safety nets in developing countries as soon as possible and - more broadly - much greater attention to the impact of COVID in developing countries and what the international community can do to help.” Get our Coronavirus Update newsletter for the day's crucial developments at a glance, the numbers you need to know and what our readers are saying.

28,/business/banking-and-finance/bank-dividend-cuts-were-inevitable-with-or-without-apra-s-direction-20200409-p54ik8.html,"Bank dividend cuts were inevitable, with or without APRA's direction","The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. The major banks showed last year they were prepared to tailor their dividend payouts to their circumstances. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. While the banks may have had no other realistic choice but to support their customers if they wanted to emerge from this episode with customers, the effect of their actions is to put a significant hole of uncertain dimensions in their earnings and capital bases as they effectively subsidise large swathes of those customers, knowing that many of those subsidies will end up as bad debts. And the challenges to bank profitability don’t only flow from the actions the lenders have taken to provide life support for their customers, and the economy. The Reserve Bank’s actions in cutting the cash rate to 25 basis points and targeting a three-year bond rate at that same level by buying bonds will further squeeze net interest margins that were already under pressure. Last year, for perhaps the first time ever, the big four banks had an average net interest margin below 2 per cent. It’s going to be even lower now, even though the RBA has created a $90 billion-plus funding facility at 25 basis points to help them provide funding to small and medium-sized businesses. The major banks showed last year that they were prepared to tailor their dividends to the circumstances. NAB and Westpac cut their dividends and ANZ lowered its franking level. There’s no reason to believe that, had APRA not provided its directive, they would have left their dividends levels intact. While reducing their shareholder payouts will shore up the banks' capital levels – and a system already arguably the strongest in the world – it will come with some unfortunate consequences for the army of self-funded retirees who rely on franked dividends, particularly major bank dividends, for their income. The banks will have choices in responding to APRA, and will be conscious of that reliance their retail investors have on dividends to fund their living expenses. They could pay reduced dividends or they could pay out nothing at all until their situations become clearer. They could defer their interim dividends (except for the Commonwealth Bank which, with a June balance date, has already paid its interim dividend) and pay increased annual dividends or even a special dividend once the dust settles. They could maintain their dividends but have them underwritten, effectively issuing matching equity and therefore maintaining their capital bases. With an average share price fall of about 40 per cent since the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic became evident in late February, the banks would be reluctant to contemplate capital raisings. So retaining their earnings is the easiest, most efficient and least dilutive form of capital generation. Big capital raisings like those the banks made during the global financial crisis would be the option of last resort, one that would be made more difficult, or at last more expensive and dilutive, if the banks do cut or defer their dividends. Australia's banks entered this pandemic-induced financial crisis operating in one of the strongest banking systems in the world. Thanks to APRA’s decisive implementation of the recommendations of the Murray inquiry into the financial system, they are as well-capitalised and hold as much liquidity as any system. They have relatively low-risk balance sheets because of their big bias towards lending for housing , which is even more the case now that most of them (NAB being the exception) have shed their wealth management businesses. In the post-GFC era, they have also dramatically reduced their exposure to short-term wholesale funding markets, which means the decisions of credit ratings agencies are of less consequence than they might have been in the past. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. This week Fitch downgraded the major banks, and S&P lowered its outlook for them but that should have only a marginal impact on their funding costs. S&P has also, not surprisingly, lowered the outlook for Australia’s credit rating, which would flow through to the banks’ ratings given that governments’ ability to support their banks is a factor in the banks’ own ratings. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. In advising the big banks to defer or reduce their dividends, APRA was effectively following the lead of Europe, the UK and New Zealand, all of whom have told their banks to suspend dividend payments. The European banks have less capital and have been far less profitable than their Australian counterparts, and the impact of the coronavirus is, up to now, far more profound and damaging to the populations and economies in Europe and the UK than it is here. The Morrison government also had a starting point of one of the more conservative fiscal positions of any developed world economy, enabling it to effectively throw the kitchen sink at the economy. That, and the relative success at containing the virus, will hopefully enable an earlier, stronger and more broadly-based recovery in Australia than might occur elsewhere, reducing the peak period of pressure on the banking system in the process.

BoQ has received 10,000 requests for assistance from its 168,000 small and medium businesses as a result of the crisis so far, it said at its results on Wednesday, with Mr Frazis expecting a ""V-shaped"" economic recovery from the crisis. However,  he cautioned that some businesses, such as pubs,  may find it more difficult to recover from the economic slump and a longer period of restrictions would only make things tougher. BOQ chief executive says maintaining social distancing policies until there is a vaccine would be ""a long time for businesses to be in hibernation."" Credit:Peter Braig   “I think the longer we leave it the more difficult it gets, not just for business customers but also just for the sanity of our personal customers,” Mr Frazis told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. “My sense is that we do need to get to a position where we think through thoughtfully, when do we start releasing some of the constraints, and when do we start enabling more businesses to get to some form of normality in terms of their operations?” “For us to come out of this quicker in a safe and healthy way, we just need to be doing even more testing,"" he said. ""That is a long time for businesses to be in hibernation, and I would say that if you go down that path, really you are talking about more businesses not making it through,"" he said. Mr Frazis' comments came as BoQ became the first local bank to defer making a decision on its first-half dividend, after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) intervened on Tuesday, urging banks to conserve capital to support the economy. The bank on Wednesday also posted a 10 per cent fall in cash profit, to $151 million, for the six months ended February 29. Statutory profit for the period slumped 40 per cent, to $93 million, on restructuring charges and changes to intangible assets. The regional lender is heavily exposed to small and medium enterprises, and Mr Frazis said it would be important these businesses think about how firms might be repositioned after crisis. A large proportion of these customers are health businesses, including dentists, which have been forced to effectively stop operating. Mr Frazis said dentists were an example of businesses that would bounce back strongly, but he said other clients could face a more challenging recovery. In retail banking,  BoQ has received about 5,000 requests for assistance from customers and Mr Frazis warned of a slowdown in the housing sector due to conservatism from buyers, a lack of international buyers and a ban on open house inspections. ""You would have to say in the short term, until there's clarity around how quickly we come out of this, there will be a likely sharp drop in house prices and a drop in sales,"" he said. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the regulatory guidance on dividends had given BoQ an opportunity to ""rebase"" dividend expectations in the market, and build up more capital. ""BoQ is clearly a work in progress at this stage and the interim dividend deferral suggests things will get worse before they get better,"" Mr Lim said.

In retail banking,  BoQ has received about 5,000 requests for assistance from customers and Mr Frazis warned of a slowdown in the housing sector due to conservatism from buyers, a lack of international buyers and a ban on open house inspections. ""You would have to say in the short term, until there's clarity around how quickly we come out of this, there will be a likely sharp drop in house prices and a drop in sales,"" he said. Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said the regulatory guidance on dividends had given BoQ an opportunity to ""rebase"" dividend expectations in the market, and build up more capital. ""BoQ is clearly a work in progress at this stage and the interim dividend deferral suggests things will get worse before they get better,"" Mr Lim said. BoQ shares ended the session on Wednesday 2.1 per cent weaker at $5.03. Clancy Yeates is a business reporter. Copyright © 2020", Clancy Yeates ,"April 8, 2020"
34,/business/banking-and-finance/the-coronavirus-will-accelerate-the-trend-towards-a-cashless-society-20200408-p54i6u.html,The coronavirus will accelerate the trend towards a cashless society,"The world after the coronavirus will probably be far more digitised, and payment systems appear as likely to be impacted by this as any other aspect of daily life. The use of cash has been falling around the world. In Australia, less than 30 per cent of payments are in cash these days, whereas a decade and a half ago more than 70 per cent of transactions were in cash. In Sweden, the use of cash for payments is so low – about 10 per cent of payments -- it is a near-cashless society. The pandemic and the fear of infection from bank notes are accelerating the trend away from cash towards digital payments. Amid fears of getting the coronavirus, many businesses have stopped accepting cash from customers.Credit:AAP The Bank for International Settlements, in a paper released late last week, said the outbreak had led to unprecedented public concerns about viral transmission via cash, with central banks reporting a large increase in media inquiries about the safety of using cash and internet searches for the combination of ""cash"" and ""virus"" soaring. The intensity of recent searches for those two words, according to graphics in the BIS paper, is most acute in Australia and France. Around the world, countries are sterilising their bank notes even though there are, as yet, no known cases of transmission via cash. The virus appears, however, to survive longer on non-porous materials like plastic and steel, which probably explains consumers’ anxiety. Historically, in times of crisis, consumers hoarded cash. This time, however, appears to be different and the pandemic could accelerate the trend away from cash and towards digital transactions. It is already generating increased interest in digital currencies, with China said to be close to releasing a digital version of its currency. In recent years most central banks have started researching the potential for digital currencies, with their efforts intensifying after Facebook attempted to launch its own global digital currency, Libra. The Libra rollout stalled after some of its core backers pulled out in the face of strong central bank and legislators’ opposition to the notion of a privately-owned digital currency, and it appears Facebook might try to alter its strategy towards the use of Libra’s infrastructure as a platform for third parties’ digital payment ambitions. Facebook was pursuing a ""stable coin"" strategy, with Libra’s value established by a basket of physical currencies whose value would match that of the value of the stable coins in circulation. That is quite different – and was far more of a threat to central banks and their influence over their financial systems -- than a conventional cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, whose value is very unstable and therefore makes it a poor medium of exchange. There’s the risk of a generational divide if central banks move too quickly on the digital front, given that the profile of those most reliant on cash transactions tilts heavily towards older people. Libra’s launch galvanised the central banks’ interest in their own digital currencies, as well as their efforts in thwarting Facebook’s ambitions. Central banks including the Reserve Bank have been researching and trialling elements of digital currency platforms. The RBA has run simulations of a wholesale system, for instance, for interbank settlements. Most of the central banks are wary about rushing towards a digital currency future because of the potential disruptions it might cause to their existing banking systems if people were given a choice of holding digital currency issued directly by a central bank rather depositing funds with privately-owned commercial banks. In financial markets like Australia’s or Canada’s, where the banking systems operated soundly through the global financial crisis, have sophisticated digital payment systems and now, after significant strengthening of their capital bases and liquidity, are supporting their economies through the pandemic, there’s no urgency to fundamentally change the structure of – to disintermediate -- their financial systems. There’s also the risk of a generational divide if central banks move too quickly on the digital front, given that the profile of those most reliant on cash transactions tilts heavily towards older people. Nevertheless, the seemingly inexorable trend towards digitisation of payment systems, combined with the likelihood that other countries like Sweden and China will move early and the potential for the big tech companies like Facebook, Google or Amazon to create their own currencies and payment systems outside traditional banking systems, means the central banks have no option but to continue to explore the potential of digital currencies. That exploration will have a sharper edge if China digitises its currency. Only this week, China recommitted itself to the introduction of a digital yuan. It sees a digitised currency as a way of increasing its global influence and reducing the dominance of the US dollar in global commerce and finance, a dominance that enables the US to exert geopolitical influence through the global financial system. China has some unlikely allies, with no little thanks to Donald Trump’s diminishing of America’s role in key international institutions, his ""America First"" agenda and his willingness to use tariffs and sanctions against America’s foes. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, shocked many last year when he advocated development of a ""multi-polar"" digital currency to displace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency, arguing that there was growing asymmetry between the dominance of the dollar in the global financial system and the diminished US share of global economic activity. The US accounts for only about 10 per cent of world trade and 15 per cent of global GDP but two thirds of all countries peg their currency to the US dollar, and more than half of global trade is invoiced in US dollars. Global financial market activity is dominated by the greenback. As the US withdraws from global economic leadership, a ""synthetic hegemonic currency"" would dampen the domineering influence of the US dollar on global trade and the impact of domestic developments in the US economy and markets wouldn’t spill over to the same degree into other economies and markets, Carney said. He didn’t say – but China would be aware – that a reduced role for the US dollar would also have a negative impact on the US economy and living standards. Its status as the world’s reserve economy allows Americans to live well beyond their means, lowering the cost of imports and Americans’ cost of borrowing. Thus there are geopolitical dimensions to the push towards digital currencies that coincide with the sharper edge that the pandemic has given central banks' interest in facilitating digital payments and investigating digital currencies.

This has jumped 60 basis points since mid-March despite a shower of liquidity and unprecedented emergency action by the Federal Reserve. Libor matters: some $US9 trillion ($14.6 trillion) of global contracts are priced off the benchmark. Banks were the villains of the 2008 crisis. This time they are the designated saviours, deemed strong enough to hold the line against COVID-19. They are to be the conduit for disaster relief, the backstop lenders for drowning firms and households. Regulators have eased capital rules to free up $US5 trillion of loans worldwide. The European Central Bank has waived its capital rules, freeing up €120 billion ($212 billion) in bank equity base. ""Rainy day"" buffers are being activated. Excellent.

Moody's has already placed Europe's banking system on negative alert. Harvard professor Ignazio Angeloni, an ex-member of the ECB's supervisory board, says European banks could ""cease to function or fail on a massive scale"" as losses pile up.

Club Med debt ratios are likely to jump 20 percentage points of GDP (to 155 per cent in Italy's case). Painfully slow recovery and post-crisis hysteresis will be slow torture for their banks. The risk is that the sovereigns and the banks will drag each other down in a horrible spiral. That is why the proposal for (ESM) bailout loans - piling more debt on the debtors - is a Faustian Pact that resolves nothing. Mr Angeloni said the EU has to ""block this doom scenario"" by recapitalising banks on the joint EU credit card. But it is not just Europe. Banks may not be strong enough to fulfil their new role as saviours in any part of the world, including the US, China, and Japan. None of the major lending systems were ever stress-tested for an economic deep freeze lasting months. The Federal Reserve's ""severely adverse scenario"" for 2020 assumed a worst case rise in unemployment to 10 per cent over 18 months. This has already been blown apart. The US has lost 10 million jobs in two weeks. The St Louis Fed warns that 47 million workers could be laid off in short order, pushing the unemployment rate to 32 per cent.

The Cecchetti analysis said capital buffers have been weakening for some time, but have gone parabolic since the pandemic hit, ""threatening financial stability across all major jurisdictions"".

Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, BNY Mellon, and Morgan Stanley, among others, are suspending buybacks. The ECB has ordered the biggest banks under its purview to freeze both dividends and buybacks. In short, a pandemic shutdown lasting more than three months will cause economic and financial ""system failure"" so we are in the lap of the gods at this point.

Banks have in recent weeks said small businesses and households can defer their loan repayments for up to six months if needed, but Fitch predicted this would not stop some loans from going into default.

""As a result, asset-quality metrics will likely weaken from current levels over the next 12-18 months,"" Fitch said. The plunge in official interest rates was another risk identified by Fitch. Falling rates crunch banks' net interest margins, which refer to the difference between banks' funding costs and what they charge for loans. ""Earnings will face pressure from both higher impairment charges and lower interest rates. The central banks in Australia and New Zealand have cut their respective cash rates to 0.25 per cent and indicated that they will remain there for a prolonged period,"" Fitch said.

""I expect there will be a vaccine that works and is safe and comes online, and the numbers will come down dramatically. But this is a viral infection that will stay with us. It's not going away,"" he said. Mesoblast major shareholder and CEO, Professor Silviu Itescu. Credit:Josh Robenstone The chief of the regenerative medicine company also warned against relaxing any social distancing rules in the coming months, observing Australia's relatively low rate of infections was a result of the national shutdown. ""I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming,"" he said. ""Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to put it back in again."" On Thursday, Mesoblast told the Australian stock exchange it had secured an agreement with the US National Institute of Health to test its stem cell treatment on coronavirus patients and establish whether it will reduce the mortality of patients with severe respiratory illness caused by the virus. The company's Remestemcel-L product will be evaluated in a trial of 240 patients with COVID-19 to test its effectiveness in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can occur after the body's immune system has an excessive response to the virus, called a cytokine storm, which in turn results in damage to lung tissue. The mortality rate of those with acute respiratory distress syndrome because of coronavirus is as high as 80 per cent. Remestemcel-L has been developed for other inflammatory conditions and was successful in a Phase-3 trial in children to treat a condition called acute graft-versus-host disease,  a condition in which the body's immune cells attack healthy cells after a bone marrow transplant. The thinking is that those with acute respiratory distress syndrome have similarities in terms of the inflammation response seen in those with acute graft-versus-host disease. Dr Itescu said the company will evaluate whether the treatment will reduce coronavirus mortality rates within a 28-day period.

""I expect there will be a vaccine that works and is safe and comes online, and the numbers will come down dramatically. But this is a viral infection that will stay with us. It's not going away,"" he said. Mesoblast major shareholder and CEO, Professor Silviu Itescu. Credit:Josh Robenstone The chief of the regenerative medicine company also warned against relaxing any social distancing rules in the coming months, observing Australia's relatively low rate of infections was a result of the national shutdown. ""I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming,"" he said. ""Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to put it back in again."" On Thursday, Mesoblast told the Australian stock exchange it had secured an agreement with the US National Institute of Health to test its stem cell treatment on coronavirus patients and establish whether it will reduce the mortality of patients with severe respiratory illness caused by the virus. The company's Remestemcel-L product will be evaluated in a trial of 240 patients with COVID-19 to test its effectiveness in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can occur after the body's immune system has an excessive response to the virus, called a cytokine storm, which in turn results in damage to lung tissue. The mortality rate of those with acute respiratory distress syndrome because of coronavirus is as high as 80 per cent. Remestemcel-L has been developed for other inflammatory conditions and was successful in a Phase-3 trial in children to treat a condition called acute graft-versus-host disease,  a condition in which the body's immune cells attack healthy cells after a bone marrow transplant. The thinking is that those with acute respiratory distress syndrome have similarities in terms of the inflammation response seen in those with acute graft-versus-host disease. Dr Itescu said the company will evaluate whether the treatment will reduce coronavirus mortality rates within a 28-day period. It will take around three months to recruit patients for the trial but there should be some indications of the treatment's effectiveness as early as July, he said.

The original measure, ""cash flow assistance for businesses"" announced on March 12 and then updated on March 22, in most cases did not result in cash received. The second measure announced on March 30 applies to all businesses and will result in cash being received. Scott Morrison's government has unveiled a number of small business support measures over the past three weeks but eligibility varies. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen To be eligible for cash flow assistance businesses must have an annual turnover of less than $50 million and have employees. The credits are only available to active eligible employers that had been established prior to March 12, 2020. How small businesses that commenced operating during the March 2020 quarter, that had not registered as a group employer by March 12, will be affected is unknown. For eligible small businesses the cash flow assistance is as a credit on their March BAS equal to 100 per cent of their total PAYG withholding tax deducted from employees’ wages, up to a maximum of $50,000 with a minimum credit of $10,000. Most small businesses are unlikely to receive a payment as a result of this relief measure, unless a business has a total for PAYG withholding and net GST for the March quarter that is less than $10,000 credit. For example, a business with two employees that deducted $5000 in PAYG withholding for the March quarter, and has a net GST payable amount after taking into account input tax credits of $4000, should receive a $1000 refund. No application needs to be made to receive the cash flow benefit, but businesses must lodge their March quarter BAS. The cash flow assistance for eligible businesses will also apply to the June quarter BAS, which must be lodged by July 28, 2020. Replay   The original measure did not provide any benefits for small businesses that did not have employees, such as sole traders and partnerships. The only assistance available to these small business owners was allowing them to apply for the job seeker support with Centrelink, which came with the extra Coronavirus supplement of $550 a fortnight. The second measure, the ""JobKeeper payment"", will result in businesses receiving a cash payment of $1500 per eligible employee from March 30, 2020 for a maximum period of six months. Eligible small businesses will be those: The period used to assess whether there has been a decrease of more than 30 per cent must be at least a month, but it could also be for periods of three months, six months, or nine months. This means if a business has 30 per cent less income for the current period ended March 31, 2020, compared to the month, quarter, half year, or nine months ending March 2019, they should be eligible for the payment. Eligible employees are those employed by a business that has met the reduction in turnover requirement, and: The application process for eligible businesses with employees requires them to register their interest in receiving the JobKeeper payment on the Australian tax offices website. As the legislation to give effect to this job keeper payment has not yet been passed there is some uncertainty with regard to how it will work. For example, where a business wants to keep its employees on the payroll while they are not working, but only paying them the JobKeeper payment, would they be in breach of industrial awards or Fair Work Commission rules. Businesses without employees will thankfully also benefit from the JobKeeper payment. However, the amount of JobKeeper payment that they receive will be limited to one person per business. This means a partnership or other business entities, such as companies and trusts, operating a business without employees can only get the payment for one person. Small businesses that receive the JobKeeper payment, if they want to continue receiving the payment, will need to provide information to the ATO on a monthly basis. Exactly what this information will be is not known, but it will include the number of eligible employees employed by the business.

But from that boredom one savvy operator in the historic gold mining town came up with ‘Boober Eats’, a risqué take on the classic food delivery business model using skimpies. 'Boober Eats' is a new take on the popular food delivery service. Nat Poole, Boober Eats brainchild and owner of Kalgoorlie-based skimpy agency La Femme Fatale, came up with the service after racking her brain for ideas to keep her workers in a job. “It literally just started off as a joke sitting in the lounge room with one of my skimpies,” she said. “I put a post up still rolling on as a joke, but people started contacting me. It was insane and it started the next day.” Users order food online, which is picked up by a Boober Eats skimpy and driver and delivered to the customer’s door. The cost of delivery is about six times the normal online food delivery charge. Ms Poole said the idea had proven so popular it had grown from one driver and skimpy on the first night to four teams, and she was recruiting to expand across Australia. “We got 10 calls on the first night and yesterday the phone started ringing at 3pm,” she said. “I’m getting a lot of calls for it across Australia. For the rest of this week, I will focus on Kal then start sending out girls in the rest of Australia.” Social distancing measures escalated rapidly in March, tightening from bans of gatherings of 500 or more to just two people outside of homes. These measures hit the hospitality and accommodation sector hardest, with more than 90 per cent across the country reporting impacts to their operations and a reduction in demand, according to an ABS survey of businesses released Tuesday. 'Boober Eats’ is a risqué take on the food delivery business model using Kalgoorlie's skimpies. The survey revealed 78 per cent of businesses in the sector had made changes to its workforce including temporarily reducing hours (70 per cent), placing staff on unpaid leave (43 per cent) and placing staff on paid leave (29 per cent). Ms Poole said Boober Eats would keep money coming through the door for her skimpies. “It is definitely really important, we all need to survive,” she said. “I hated seeing all my girls go from working five days a week and making really good money to nothing.” While the workers were scantily clad, Ms Poole said they regularly used sanitiser and wore gloves and face masks: “1.5 [metres], stay alive, that’s what I tell the girls.” Hamish Hastie is WAtoday's business reporter.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said 14 authorisations allowing the collaboration had been granted. But he warned against smaller businesses being squeezed out of the market place from these arrangements. ""We've got to make sure we've got competition on the other side"": ACCC boss Rod Sims.Credit:AAP ""I think we've got it right - but we'll monitor them really closely,"" Mr Sims said. ""Competitors are working well together to boost supply, but what we've got to make sure of is that some of the smaller players don't get hurt on the way through."" Some of the 14 separate authorisations issued by the ACCC aim to help maintain or increase the supply of goods and services, others will organise industry competitors to present a united policy on how to deal with hardship cases. ""We've got to make sure we've got competition on the other side,"" he said. ""We wouldn't want to lose some of our innovative companies. We've got to make sure we're not doing things to significantly damage small businesses."" Replay   Mr Sims said it was vital that small butchers, greengrocers and other independent traders were allowed to stay open along with the supermarkets in the event of a total lockdown. He said the biggest challenge for the consumer watchdog was ensuring consumer rights were maintained without risking the viability of businesses. ""It's tricky,"" Mr Sims said. ""We've got to balance that there are many services who can't provide their services because of the government lockdown."" The ""easy ones"" are things like fitness companies still taking subscription fees from customers despite their gyms being closed, he said. ""Where we've got companies giving you a credit or a refund but charging fees, we've had to step in and say 'you can't do that' ...

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said 14 authorisations allowing the collaboration had been granted. But he warned against smaller businesses being squeezed out of the market place from these arrangements.

Some of the 14 separate authorisations issued by the ACCC aim to help maintain or increase the supply of goods and services, others will organise industry competitors to present a united policy on how to deal with hardship cases.

We've got to make sure we're not doing things to significantly damage small businesses.""

He said the biggest challenge for the consumer watchdog was ensuring consumer rights were maintained without risking the viability of businesses. ""It's tricky,"" Mr Sims said. ""We've got to balance that there are many services who can't provide their services because of the government lockdown."" The ""easy ones"" are things like fitness companies still taking subscription fees from customers despite their gyms being closed, he said.

Coles said the more flexible trading hours were welcome, even though it has reduced its trading hours to allow staff to clean and restock. “Last week Coles reduced trading hours nationally to give our team members the time and space to extensively clean our stores and replenish the shelves for customers the next day. In particular this ensures cleanliness for our elderly and vulnerable customers attending our Community Hour in the first hour of trade. ""We appreciate the flexibility around trading hours and thank the federal, state and local governments for their rapid action to help us continue to serve customers during these challenging times.” A spokesperson for Woolworths said that the company welcomed the government’s decision to provide ""much-needed"" operational flexibility.

56,/business/workplace/what-will-tomorrow-s-workplace-bring-more-elbow-room-for-starters-20200408-p54i85.html,"What will tomorrow’s workplace bring? More elbow room, for starters","Many workers are weeks, if not months, from returning to their offices and regaining a semblance of a normal workday. Given the recent layoff and furlough announcements, many are wondering whether they will even have a job after the dust settles. But building owners and company leaders — and those who help them manage properties and design workplaces — have begun to anticipate the time when the stay-at-home orders are lifted and people start heading back to the office. Those in the midst of planning suggest that the post-pandemic office might look radically different. Returning workers can expect stepped-up cleaning and a reinforcement of social distancing. Hand sanitiser stands will probably be positioned in lobbies. Maintenance staff will swab door handles. There may be limits on the number of people allowed in a lift. Offices will have to be reconfigured for life after the pandemic.Credit:Rohan Thomson Workplaces may have significant changes in the long run, including new seating arrangements and the addition of building materials that discourage the spread of germs. New technology could provide access to rooms and elevators without employees having to touch a handle or press a button. Even if such changes won't greet most employees at first, their return to the office may be carefully choreographed. In the short term, signs may be posted reminding everyone to wash hands — and perhaps stick with elbow bumps rather than handshakes and hugs. Disinfectant wipes will be everywhere. Some companies are considering phasing in employees to limit the number of people on the premises and ease them back to office life after a prolonged period of sequestering at home. ""You're trying to build confidence and a secure feeling,"" said Matthew Barlow, a vice chairman of Savills, a real estate company. Remote-work practices that many companies have adopted in recent weeks are likely to continue in some form for the foreseeable future, leaving some offices lightly populated and making it easier for workers to spread out. Alternating groups of employees at the office is also under discussion. ""There could be A teams and B teams working different days,"" said Scott Rechler, chief executive and chairman of RXR Realty. Moving desks farther apart could also give workers more elbow room. The whole point of kinetic furniture was to bring people together. Now it has a different function: to pull people apart. Over the past decade, many companies eliminated private offices in favour of open plans, but the amount of space per office worker declined 25 per cent, said Janet Pogue McLaurin, an architect and principal at the design firm Gensler, which has been tracking changes in the workplace in annual surveys since 2008. The typical workstation of a decade ago — the cubicle — was 2.40 by 2.40 metres. By 2015, the workstation was down to 1.80 by 2.40 metres, and in recent years, the contraction has continued. Benching — desks lined up side by side — has been another way workers have been squeezed. A benching desk with a width of 1.80 metres would be consistent with current social distancing guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many desks are not that wide. And often one row of desks faces another row, so that employees are directly opposite their peers. To create a 1.80-metre radius around each employee, companies may have to pull desks apart or stagger employees so they are not facing one another, experts say. Companies are considering other ways to give employees breathing room. A conference room intended for 12 might be repurposed as a meeting room for six. In lounge areas, chairs could be placed farther apart. Chairs on casters will permit people to roll seats a safe distance from colleagues. ""The whole point of kinetic furniture was to bring people together,"" said Kelly Griffin, a principal at NBBJ who leads the architecture firm's workplace strategy group. ""Now it has a different function: to pull people apart."" Ten per cent of US office workers no longer have assigned seats, according to Gensler. This so-called hot-desking, or hotelling — where employees do not have designated desks but instead come in and find a place to sit — may go on hiatus, if only until the fear of contagion fades. ""Maybe we don't move around quite as much,"" McLaurin said. Or gather in large groups. All-hands meetings may not resume immediately, said Michael Kleinberg, president and partner of MKDA, an interior design firm. ""Nobody is going to want to come,"" he added. ""I think there's going to be a continuation of Zoom meetings for a while."" However, the pandemic may result in fundamental changes that will be around for years to come, altering how office buildings are designed. Just as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks created tighter security measures in office buildings and flooding from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompted the elevation of mechanical systems, the coronavirus may focus attention on air circulation and filtering. Sensor-activated controls may also increase, reducing the number of surfaces that need to be touched in an office and allowing workers to use lifts and open doors with the wave of a hand. Certain materials may come to the fore. Smooth surfaces that are easy to wipe will be preferable to textured or porous ones that could harbour germs. And antimicrobial materials used in hospitals and laboratories may migrate to offices. Interest has surged in new materials such as those that mimic sharkskin, to which microscopic organisms have difficulty adhering. Some old metals may experience a revival. Copper and its alloys — including brass and bronze — have been shown to be essentially self-sanitising, able to kill bacteria and, early studies suggest, perhaps even the coronavirus plaguing the planet. The ability to work from home at least a few days a week — long sought by many workers — may be here to stay. Even firms that previously insisted on everyone's being in the office — either from force of habit or a suspicion that employees would loaf if not under management's watchful eye — have discovered that the work-from-home experiment that the crisis has thrust on large swathes of the workforce has turned out better than expected. ""A big light bulb went off during this pandemic,"" said Anita Kamouri, vice president at Iometrics, a workplace services firm. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, expects more than 25 per cent of employees to continue working from home multiple days a week, up from less than 4 per cent who did so before the pandemic. ""I don't think that genie is going back into the bottle,"" she said. Already preliminary findings from a new study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggest that more than 34 per cent of respondents have switched from commuting to working at home across the United States. In the Northeast, more than 40 per cent have made the switch. The digital infrastructure for remote work already existed, said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and a co-author of the study. ""The tools people found are working pretty well,"" he said. If companies do allow more of their employees to log in from home, some may consider reducing their office footprint, which could have significant ramifications for commercial real estate. But if the amount of space devoted to employee workstations and other functions increases, demand for space could balance out. Lounges, cafes and other gathering spaces that sprang up to make collaborative work easier may become even more important if employees do more work from home and commute in for meetings. At the Seattle office of B+H Architects, an informal space called the Sandbox was designed as ""a place to meet and exchange ideas,"" said Doug Demers, a managing principal at the firm. The circular room has a large digital screen for sharing information and curved seating that provides a sense of enclosure. People working from home could call in remotely, Demers said, but he thinks this kind of space will be one of the things that draw employees back to the office because it helps provide a sense of community. ""There will be a higher value around spaces where we come together,"" he said. The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Jane Margolies ,"April 8, 2020"

To its credit, the Australian government shelved its union-busting agenda, instead collaborating with the ACTU to protect businesses and workers affected by the COVID-19 shutdown through the new JobKeeper payment. ACTU Secretary Sally McManus.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen But new policies hold firm to the government’s immigration policy of restricting rights for the large population of temporary migrant workers. On Saturday Immigration Minister Alan Tudge confirmed that while visa holders are ‘valuable to the Australian economy and way of life’, ‘Australians and permanent residents’ are the priority. Our research, published in the current issue of The Economic and Labour Relations Review, demonstrates that successive policy changes since the 1990s have increasingly marginalised temporary migrant workers. Our findings highlight the adverse impacts of government policies that have imposed barriers to temporary migrants’ ability to move between employers and to protections offered by unions and the Fair Work Ombudsman. Other policies have narrowed pathways to permanent residency and citizenship and restricted their access to public services. Australians have collectively ignored overwhelming evidence that these policies contribute to widespread wage and superannuation theft in part because we rely on temporary migrant workers to perform dirty, dangerous and demeaning jobs in food services, delivery, retail, horticulture, health, social care and cleaning. These jobs, and therefore temporary migrants, are crucial in the COVID-19 crisis. Nonetheless, many temporary migrants have lost their jobs during the current shutdown. Most temporary migrants are excluded from the JobKeeper payment and other forms of welfare assistance including Medicare. Under new policies announced on Saturday, many may now access superannuation, but this is illusory for victims of wage and superannuation theft. Temporary Skill Shortage visa holders, sponsored for up to four years, must still leave the country within 60 days of losing their jobs. For those who cannot support themselves or be useful to immediate labour market needs, the Minister says it's time to go home. But current restrictions have made international travel almost impossible. Ironically our borders have become more secure, but it is now as difficult to leave Australia as it is to enter for citizens and temporary visa holders alike. Stephen Clibborn, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney Business School. The government rightly encourages us to self-isolate and seek medical assistance if we show symptoms rather than risking further spread of the virus. But continued exclusionary temporary migration and social security policies may now exacerbate our public health crisis. Exclusion from the JobKeeper payment and other social security may push temporary migrants to work when sick and into the informal labour market. While some state governments have waived COVID-19-related medical costs for temporary residents, restricted access to Medicare may discourage them from medical visits. We are all in this public health crisis together and we no longer have the luxury to exclude. COVID-19 does not discriminate based on visa, residency or citizenship status and nor should our policies responding to it. Chris F Wright, a senior lecturer specialising in immigration and labour markets at the University of Sydney Business School.Credit:  For many decades, Australia had a highly inclusive immigration system where virtually all migrants had permanent residency with full access to employment and social rights. The Australian government should return to this approach and extend protections available to citizens to all temporary migrants, following the Portuguese government’s recent example. Australia is a nation of immigrants with a workforce of immigrants. Temporary migrants contribute greatly to our economy and society: it’s why we encouraged them to Australia in the first place. Now we must reciprocate. Not only is it fair, it’s in our collective interest.

On Tuesday, the federal government introduced mandatory regulations for landlords to give rent relief for businesses with less than $50 million in turnover and rent reviews for others. Mr Allen said his leasing team was talking to all 3600 tenants in its Westfield shopping centre portfolio and would assess each one on a case-by-case basis. He said he would not discuss lease agreements with dissident tenants, ""through the press"". Last month, retailer Solomon Lew, chairman of Premier Investments, which owns Smiggle and Portmans brands, said he would not pay rent during the shutdown. In his address to the annual general meeting, Mr Allen said: ""We continue to work our way through the economic shock with our retailers and their banks, in particular, our small to medium-sized retailers or ‘mum and dad’ retailers who are most vulnerable."" As a way to help tenants and keep sales ticking over, Scentre has bought forward the launch of Westfield direct, a drive-through service at the shopping centres to pick up goods bought online. At the AGM, the remuneration report received a 23 per cent vote against, although it is a non-binding resolution, while the vote to give performance rights to Mr Allen received a 21 per cent vote against, which is a binding resolution.

The 211 Northumberland Street property is a 7654-square-metre building, home to Centrelink, and was sold at a passing initial yield of 6.59 per cent on behalf of vendor ESR. The four-level building has a four-star NABERS rating and a weighed average lease expiry of 3.04 years, with easy access to the Hume Highway. An office at 211 Northumberland Street in the Liverpool CBD has sold for $52.5m. John McCann, James Barber and Frank Oliveri of Colliers and Peter Vines and Victor Sheu of Ray White Commercial advised on the sale. Mr McCann, national director of investment services at Colliers International, said there had been strong demand in Liverpool over the past 12 months, with the new airport in close proximity and the shortage of good-quality investment stock ""meaning 211 Northumberland Street was very well received by the market"". Another recent deal was the on-market sale was the Leichhardt Collection, a sale and lease back on behalf of Best and Less. Colliers International's James Cowan and Matthew Meynell brokered the $29 million at a passing initial yield of 4.63 per cent. Mr Meynell, head of investment services Australia, said it had become apparent that property was relatively more attractive than cash or equities and ""our recent campaigns have displayed a level of confidence in this asset class amidst the current market conditions"".

Workers were told on Friday morning that those working two weeks on and one week off would move to a four on, two off arrangement while workers on four and three days and eight and six days would start working two weeks on, two off. FMG workers will move to drastically different rosters over the next three months to stop the spread of coronavirus.Credit:Quentin Jones The roster changes come after growing concern over the impact the virus would have in WA's regions and remote communities and images emerge of miners not following social distancing protocols. Miners have so far been exempt from any major restrictions, including some interstate travel, but earlier this week all non-essential travel to WA's Kimberley region was banned and some shire councillors in the area have called for it to include FIFO workers. Fortescue’s chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines said Fortescue, together with the broader WA mining industry, currently had the support of governments but in order to maintain those exemptions it needed to take every precaution to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 spread. “We believe implementing a temporary change to our site operational roster will contribute to thesafety of our team, their families and the broader community, as well as help us fulfil our responsibility to provide the Fortescue family with secure employment during this uncertain time,"" she said. “We have a strong track record of doing what we say we are going to do. ""The iron ore industry and the Pilbara more broadly is the engine room of WA and Australia’s economy and it is our responsibility to make sure we have a healthy, committed workforce that allows us to continue operating during this crisis."" The company said the new rosters would reduce movement on and off Fortescue's sites by approximately 40 per cent and would be in place for an initial period of three months with the possibility to extend to six months. Goldfields gold miner Saracen also announced today it had opted for longer FIFO rosters for all its personnel to at least three weeks on, three weeks off. It has also restricted FIFO travel to charter flights only with strict health screening before departure. FMG's Pilbara rivals BHP and Rio Tinto were also reviewing rosters. On Thursday WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state government was working with miners cooperatively to make sure they were adhering to social distancing rules.

65,/business/companies/miles-underground-sleeping-at-work-how-miners-try-to-dodge-the-virus-20200327-p54ehg.html,"Miles underground, sleeping at work: How miners try to dodge the virus","There's room for about 2,500 people, a golf simulator and a three-storey cafe at BHP Group's Mulla Mulla mining camp, deep in WA's remote Pilbara region, one of the world's most important iron ore hubs. The site and dozens more like it would be a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. But sending employees to work from home isn't an option. For much of the year, it is their home; where they eat, sleep and work in close proximity for weeks at a time. It's a potentially devastating risk that the biggest resources companies are juggling the world over, from oil rigs in the North Sea to copper mines in the Chilean desert. With much of the world's raw materials extracted in remote and inhospitable locations, they're scrambling to protect the well-being of their vast residential workforces while keeping the world supplied with critical commodities. BHP's Mulla Mulla camp: Sites like this could be a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. Credit:Trevor Collens ""We are not a business that can do all of our work remotely,"" said Mike Henry, chief executive officer of BHP, the world's top miner and a company that employs about 72,000 staff or contractors, ""We are fully focused on action to reduce the risk of transmission."" BHP isn't alone. Mines in Chile to oil fields on Alaska's North Slope are limiting access, splitting crews into rotating teams and checking temperatures of employees as they step aboard helicopters or pass through access gates at sites. Isolation zones have been set up at accommodation villages, hot buffets scrapped at canteens, and extra cleaners hired. Here in Australia, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is on alert to airlift patients from far-flung operations, while at Rio Tinto Group's Kitimat aluminium smelter in Canada, emergency plans for virus cases are pinned up alongside warnings about the location of grizzly bears. Sending employees to work from home isn't an option. For much of the year, it is their home; where they eat, sleep and work in close proximity for weeks at a time. Producers are also attempting to keep pace with rapidly tightening controls on the movement of people and goods, and preparing for the potential impact of multiple positive cases. ""Everyone's got a bunch of scenarios that they're planning for,"" said Paul Everingham, chief executive officer of the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia. Some cracks are appearing, though largely because the drastic government measures around the world to contain the virus are making it unfeasible to keep operating, as opposed to the virus actually taking down the workforce. Platinum powerhouse South Africa this week said it was shutting its mines for three weeks amid a nationwide lock-down, while operations in copper giants Chile and Peru have been curtailed. A widespread shutdown of global resources production would just deepen the havoc the virus is already wreaking on the commodities industry. While demand is being devastated as swathes of the world go into lock-down, China's gradually returning to work and is going to start needing more raw materials as its factories fire up again. The challenge is particularly acute in commodity powerhouses like Australia, Russia and Canada where staff often need to be transported in and housed because production sites are so remote. A wave of interstate travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus has complicated the movement of mining companies' fly-in, fly-out workers.Credit:Louie Douvis  About 20 per cent of Australia's mining workforce of around 218,000 are fly-in staff that typically stay at sites for between one and four weeks at a time. The US oil and gas sector alone employs about 157,000 people, including on offshore rigs. Canada's oil sands industry has already had suspected cases and has taken action at camps to reduce the prospects of virus transmission. Producer Suncor Energy is taking steps including spacing employees out on buses so nobody is sitting next to anyone else. And in Russia, which churns out everything from crude to nickel in some of the most remote locations on the planet, oil producer Gazprom Neft has increased the length of shifts at its camps. Crude-pipeline operator Transneft has done the same. We have remote work sites and a relatively tight density of people. ""We have remote work sites and a relatively tight density of people,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox said last week on an investor call. The producer has limited the number of workers at its assets in Alaska, freeing up bed spaces to serve as a potential quarantine, and is reviewing options at other sites, including in Norway and China. ""If necessary, we can have quarantine available in these locations,"" he said. Oil giant BP has divided workers at major operational sites into separate shifts, and is restricting contact between the two teams. Other energy producers including Royal Dutch Shell and Inpex Corp. have already had staff test positive for COVID-19 in recent days. South African utility Eskom Holdings SOC is housing power station workers in lodges away from their families. At BHP's Whaleback operation, opened in 1967 and the oldest mine in the Pilbara, yellow tape marks out social spacing distances on the floor of a cafeteria and solo workers sit at opposite ends of communal tables usually crowded with staff. Employees at other BHP sites are holding meetings in outdoor picnic areas, or using grids laid out on floors to make sure they don't stray too close when gathered indoors. A small group of tug boat operators who usually commute from Tasmania to WA -- typically a nine-hour journey on multiple flights -- have been temporarily relocated, along with their families. [Mining camps] are set up to minimise space. They're not set up for isolation because of their very nature. It's inevitable there will be some impact on output at mines as producers implement virus-protection measures, said Paul Mitchell, Sydney-based global mining and metals leader at EY, which is working with clients on handling the pandemic. ""Even if you keep running, there will be some disruption, because running at 100 per cent is going to put pressure on a workforce,"" he said. Some companies are examining options to add flexibility by housing additional workers closer to their mines in unused tourist accommodation or construction camps. BHP is seeking to hire 1,500 staff in temporary roles to help operations through the crisis. There's a recognition that busy mining camps hold risks of multiple infections once any cases arise, according to Mitchell. ""They're set up to minimise space,"" he said. ""They're not set up for isolation because of their very nature."" Even for miners who return home after their shifts, rather than living in camps, the safest place to be right now may be underground, according to Bob Timbs, a district official for the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union, which represents about 20,000 mining and energy workers in Australia. Members include workers at South32's Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operation southwest of Sydney, where shift times have been staggered and less than half the usual number of miners are packing into cages that ferry them on a journey underground that can take as long as 10 minutes. ""Once they're underground and in their development teams, they might only have contact with seven or eight people during the whole day, that's a lot less than in an office environment,"" said Timbs, a third-generation coal miner. ""I've got more concerns for the guys when they are on the surface."" Bloomberg  Copyright © 2020", David Stringer ,"March 27, 2020"
