Auction clearance rates have fallen off a cliff as buyers and sellers abandon the market in droves. Auctions and open house inspections have ceased in both NSW and Victoria; though online and phone auctions and one-on-one private inspections are still permitted. Auction clearance rates have plunged to record lows as bans on live auctions push real estate agents to run online sales. McGrath auctioneer Troy Malcolm takes bids during a live online auction on Saturday.Credit:Peter Rae More than 45 per cent of properties due to go to auction last weekend were withdrawn from sale, with the preliminary auction clearance rate plunging to just 48 per cent. Property researcher CoreLogic figures show that the clearance rate for the previous weekend was just 37.3 per cent – the lowest recorded since it commenced auction reporting data in 2008. Analysts say clearance rates are a leading indicator of major changes in property prices. Martin North, founder of Digital Finance Analytics, says even if the coronavirus-induced economic downturn is relatively short-lived, there could be property price falls of between 15 and 25 per cent over the next two or three years. ""If there's a longer-term crunch where the unemployment consequences and the failure of businesses is longer, then I think it could be 20 to 30 per cent,"" Mr North says. If the global disruption is prolonged, then it could top 45 per cent. However, the major price falls would not be uniform across the country and house prices are expected to hold up better than apartment values. ""Generally, houses hold their value more, other than the top end of the market, which is more volatile, and will do better than units,"" Mr North says. ""There are too many new [units], a lack of investors and there's a problem with [building] defects."" Hayden Dimes and Felicity Emmett, economists at ANZ bank, say the shutting down of auctions and home opens has seen both both buyers and sellers evaporate. ""As buyers and sellers dry up, we think properties that do trade through this shut-down period will see price falls,"" they say. The economists are expecting major price falls to start showing up as early as this month. Even when social distancing measures are removed, they say it is unlikely prices will bounce back. ""Despite enormous fiscal support, unemployment is still expected to rise sharply through this period and is unlikely to fully recover for some years,"" the ANZ economists say. Replay   Households are likely to have less appetite for debt, which would likely result in a slow recovery for house prices, they say. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, says higher levels of unemployment would trigger debt-servicing problems, which is bad news for property prices. This comes against a backdrop of very high household debt. He expects demand for property would be depressed for some time after the economic shutdown measures are relaxed. ""Hopefully, the federal government’s wage subsidy program will keep the rise in unemployment to below 10 per cent,"" Dr Oliver says. ""This, combined with various income-support measures and bank mortgage payment holidays, may serve to keep forced property selling to a minimum and price declines modest at around 5 per cent,"" he says. However, a long and deep coronavirus-driven downturn in the economy would point to a deeper property price slump of 20 per cent, or more, over the next 12 months, he says. More homebuyers, particularly those who purchased recently, will find that they are in ""negative equity"", where they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. However, for those who are able to hold onto their homes during the downturn, the losses in the value of their houses are on paper only. The banks’ mortgage deferrals mean most households with a home loan that see their incomes fall substantially will be able to get through the downturn without losing their home, says Trent Wiltshire, an economist at Domain. However, the banks ""will not let all customers defer loan repayments indefinitely"", he says. ""The big banks have said the deferral period is up to six months, but if the coronavirus recession drags on and people can’t return to work, this may not be long enough,"" Mr Wiltshire says.

8,/money/super-and-retirement/the-benefits-of-setting-up-a-special-disability-trust-20200407-p54hvu.html,The benefits of setting up a Special Disability Trust,"Special Disability Trusts (SDTs) enable you to provide for the accommodation and care needs of a family member with a severe disability or medical condition. The word “special” is not about the person’s care needs, rather it is about the concessions that can apply to people who gift to the trust (known as donors), as well as for the beneficiary. Special Disability Trusts can provide great benefits, but make sure you seek specialist legal and financial advice first.Credit:Think Stock To be the principal beneficiary of a SDT you must meet one of three definitions of “severe disability.” Almost anyone can gift any amount to the trust, the exceptions being the settlor of the trust, who cannot gift at all, and the principal beneficiary (or their partner), who can only gift a superannuation death benefit or bequest within three years of its receipt. No compensation monies, whether from the beneficiary or on their behalf, can be gifted to the trust. There are a number of benefits of setting up a SDT. People who are immediate family members, who have reached age pension age and receive a pension, such as the Age Pension or Carer Payment, can get a gifting concession of up to $500,000. For example, an eligible grandparent may contribute $300,000, leaving $200,000 which could still be claimed. If the $300,000 was in excess of the pension asset threshold, then the grandparent’s pension could go up by more than $23,000 a year, as a result of the gift. For the principal beneficiary, the assessable assets of the trust up to $681,750 are exempt for both pension and aged-care asset tests and the income earned by the trust and distributions from it are exempt from the income tests. For example, someone living in aged care who receives an inheritance of $700,000 may face losing their Age pension and an increase in their means tested care fee of almost $40 a day. Placing the bulk of the inheritance in a SDT could provide an increase in their pension of $24,500 a year and a reduction in their cost of aged care of $14,000 a year. An SDT also receives concessional tax treatment, with a Capital Gains Tax exemption for assets transferred to it. Unspent earnings of the trust are taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. While getting funds into the trust is fairly simple, getting funds out can be harder. The purpose of the SDT is to provide for the accommodation and care needs of the principal beneficiary. Withdrawals are limited to uses that meet those needs – and a modest level of discretionary spending of $12,250 each financial year. The trust cannot be used to directly benefit family members or pay them to provide care. Watch out for the ""look back"" on gifts to the trust within five years of the beneficiary passing away. Under these rules, the donor would need to receive back what they have contributed (in proportion to the value of the trust at that time). If they don’t, it can be assessed under the gifting rules. Special Disability Trusts can provide great benefits, but make sure you seek specialist legal and financial advice first before setting one up.

If the $300,000 was in excess of the pension asset threshold, then the grandparent’s pension could go up by more than $23,000 a year, as a result of the gift. For the principal beneficiary, the assessable assets of the trust up to $681,750 are exempt for both pension and aged-care asset tests and the income earned by the trust and distributions from it are exempt from the income tests. For example, someone living in aged care who receives an inheritance of $700,000 may face losing their Age pension and an increase in their means tested care fee of almost $40 a day. Placing the bulk of the inheritance in a SDT could provide an increase in their pension of $24,500 a year and a reduction in their cost of aged care of $14,000 a year. An SDT also receives concessional tax treatment, with a Capital Gains Tax exemption for assets transferred to it. Unspent earnings of the trust are taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. While getting funds into the trust is fairly simple, getting funds out can be harder. The purpose of the SDT is to provide for the accommodation and care needs of the principal beneficiary. Withdrawals are limited to uses that meet those needs – and a modest level of discretionary spending of $12,250 each financial year. The trust cannot be used to directly benefit family members or pay them to provide care. Watch out for the ""look back"" on gifts to the trust within five years of the beneficiary passing away. Under these rules, the donor would need to receive back what they have contributed (in proportion to the value of the trust at that time). If they don’t, it can be assessed under the gifting rules. Special Disability Trusts can provide great benefits, but make sure you seek specialist legal and financial advice first before setting one up.

10,/money/super-and-retirement/looming-p-and-i-loan-conversions-a-ticking-time-bomb-20200406-p54hh8.html,Looming P&I loan conversions a ticking time bomb,"A friend has just had his interest-only loan converted to a principle-and-interest loan, with the payments increasing from $4000 per month to $9000 per month. This has put extreme stress on his finances. I believe, in these trying times, lending institutions should be prevailed upon by the government to do their bit by not converting loans from interest only to P&I. What do you think? This is a very timely question, given that the nearly 800,000 interest-only loans that are coming up for renewal in the next nine months are a ticking time bomb. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  Unfortunately, the statements put out by bank executives do not seem to match what is happening on the ground. I suggest your friend go back to his bank and ask them to continue the loan on an interest-only basis, in view of the unique economic circumstances the world is facing. If that is not effective, contact me again, and I will look at giving the situation maximum publicity in the hope we can help your friend and the many others in the same situation. My wife and I are self-funded retirees who, until now, have not claimed any pension entitlements – except for the Low Income Health Card. I am aged 66 and my wife is 60. The balance in my superannuation income account has dropped to about $730,000. My wife also has an accumulation account with a balance of about $5000. We draw a monthly pension of $4167 from my income account, as well as random lump sums to cover items such as holidays, motor vehicles, home improvements etc. It has been suggested that I transfer $300,000 from my income account to my wife's account to reduce my assessable assets and apply for a part age pension. Is this course of action advisable? Are there are any hidden implications, such as any tax payable? As you are 66, you could certainly withdraw $300,000 tax-free and your wife could contribute that to her super using the three year bring forward rule. It would then not be counted by Centrelink until she reaches pensionable age. A bonus of this strategy would be that you are converting a large part of the taxable component of your super to non-taxable component in your wife’s name – this could dramatically reduce the death tax down the track. I wonder, with super returns currently in the negative, is it a good time to be making extra contributions? I am with an industry fund and have some money coming from my mum’s estate soon, which I want to maintain the value of (I’d hate to see it dwindling away). I think this is the perfect time to be making extra contributions to super, especially if you have a long timeframe, such as 25 years or more. Don’t forget, you can now contribute a total of $25,000 a year to super as a tax-deductible concessional contribution. This does include the employer contribution, so you would need to deduct that first to make sure you don’t make excess contributions. You can also make much larger contributions from after-tax dollars. I am aged 63 and retired. If I make a withdrawal from my super fund, do I have to pay tax, and also declare it on my 2020 tax return? Furthermore, do I need to state which portion is tax-free and which portion is taxable. As you are over 60, any withdrawals should be tax-free and nothing needs to be included on your tax return. Your super will almost certainly have taxable and non-taxable components, but the withdrawal will be made on a pro-rata basis, based on the two separate amounts. You cannot elect which component is to be withdrawn. However, that is only relevant when calculating the death tax if your super happens to be left to a non-dependent. Hopefully, that’s a long way down the track. I have a Self-Managed Super Fund which owns property and I want to give my tenant, who is a related party, a reduction in their rent because of the current financial situation. I understand that this would normally be a contravention of super regulations and wonder what the attitude of the Australian Taxation Office would be to this situation. The ATO has confirmed that for the 2019–20 and 2020–21 financial years they will not take action where a SMSF gives a tenant – who is also a related party – a temporary rent reduction. Therefore, what you propose should be fine.

11,/money/planning-and-budgeting/capital-gains-tax-on-a-rented-former-home-can-be-complicated-20200403-p54gra.html,Capital gains tax on a rented former home can be complicated,"I retired a year ago at the age of 65. I have $260,000 in super. I lived in my former home from 1987 to 2006 and then began renting it out. I purchased it for $68,000 and estimate that, in 2006, it was worth $250,000. It is now worth $600,000, with no mortgage. I live in my partner’s home, which he owns outright. In 2012, I inherited $400,000 and I purchased a property for my son and his family. My partner added another storey to the property, with my son contributing some, and it is now worth at least $1.3 million, with a mortgage of $400,000 being paid by my son. I have placed $260,000 in a linked mortgage offset account. I now want to sell my original residence and pay off the mortgage on the second property. I know this will leave my partner and I with about $400,000. My partner is 71 and has no income or super. I will not sell the second property, as I regard it as my son’s family home. They will pay us a weekly rent of $400. I have been told that if I make my original home my primary residence again, I can avoid capital gains tax when selling. For how long would I have to live there before selling? H.B. You need to think things through before you make any moves.  Credit:Michael Mucci I assume you have been living off the rent from your former home. If this has been $400 a week after expenses, then you have been living on some $20,800 a year and would not be eligible for the age pension because of your two properties. If you sell your former home, you cannot eliminate Capital Gains Tax (CGT) by simply moving into it. Since you lived in it before renting it out for 14 years, your “cost base” for CGT purposes was the value when you moved out, $250,000, plus any capital expenses e.g. renovations, paid out since. If you sell it for $600,000 your capital gain will be some $350,000, reduced by selling expenses. You would then add half, say $175,000, to your taxable income that year and, assuming you have earned $15,000 in rent, tax would come to about $63,500. If you move back into the house for one year and then sell it after 15 years' ownership since losing the CGT exemption in 2006, you would only be exempt for the one year, and only 1/15th of your capital gain would be exempt. It gets more complicated. You would need to change all your mailing addresses, move all your possessions back into the old home and try to convince the Australian Taxation Office that you and your partner of 14 years can each claim a separate main residence exempt from CGT – and that could be problematical. The rule is that if you and your partner have different homes for a period, you must choose one of the homes, or each nominate the different homes as your main residences for the period. If you nominate different homes for the period and you own more than 50 per cent, your share is exempt for half the period you and your spouse have different homes, regardless of whether you are sole or joint owners. The same applies to your partner. If he owns more than 50 per cent of the home he nominates, his share is also exempt for only half the period you have different homes. This will probably not please your partner. You could gift your 2012 property and the money in the offset account to your son and then wait five years in order to claim a part age pension, but he would have to pay a huge CGT bill, plus stamp duty, so its probably not feasible. Your son is lucky to be able to live in a $1.3 million house with just a $140,000 net mortgage. I caution against selling the first property. It is your only source of income and, if you sell it to rely on your son, then if he loses his job, or falls ill, he must necessarily give priority to his wife and children and you would be in financial strife. I am aged 64 and self-employed. I have an account with First State Super and, to date, have not contributed any money into it. I recently sold an investment property which will give me a taxable capital gain of $150,000. If I do nothing, I will be liable for about $75,000 in income tax. What I would like to know is if I was to deposit $75,000 into my super account, will I be able to claim the full $75,000 as a tax deduction in my next tax return? If not, what is the maximum allowable tax deduction? J.C. Normally, the maximum annual concessional contribution you can make – and therefore the maximum tax deduction – is $25,000, assuming you have not contracted for a firm during 2019-20 that made employer super contributions for you, since they would count towards this cap. However, you may be in luck. This is the first financial year in which you can “carry forward” any unused concessional contributions from 2018-19. If you made no deductible contributions in 2018-19, you can add the full $25,000 to this year’s maximum, for a total of $50,000. To be eligible, your TSB must have been less than $500,000 as at June 30, 2019, which may be a problem, since you appear to be in the top tax bracket. In future, people may be able to carry forward up to five years of unused concessional contributions, but this of no use to you. The ATO wants its capital gains tax this year!

12,/money/super-and-retirement/conservative-options-not-often-the-best-retirement-strategy-20200330-p54fa5.html,Conservative options not often the best retirement strategy,"We are retired and have $1.7 million in a balanced option of a major super fund. Due to the present market volatility and economic climate we recently decided to change the investment mix to 50 per cent cash and 50 per cent diversified bonds, with the plan to move this back to a balanced option after investments start to come back. I called the fund before doing this but could not book a phone interview for advice until the next week. They were also rather reluctant to say that this was a ""good idea"". I realise they cannot give too much advice over the phone without more information, but I gather they could lose out if many members switched their super from balanced into more conservative options. We are trying to protect out nest egg balance and not lose more money and certainly won’t ""lock in our losses,"" as we will move it back to balanced later on, and know this will happen down the track sometime. Is our decision a ""sensible"" one? The fund you mention is a big one with large holdings of cash. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  I don't think other members would be disadvantaged overall if many members switched to more conservative options. Hopefully, the younger fund members eventually returning to work after the coronavirus pandemic will switch their employer contributions to high-growth options to take advantage of the current low share prices. The staff member at the super fund is prohibited by law from giving you detailed advice on the issues you are discussing and, in any event, I don’t think switching to cash and bonds is a “good idea” anyway. You are in a balanced option, which means your money should be spread over a wide range of assets. The idea of moving 50 per cent of your retirement funds to bonds at a time when interest rates are at a record low has the potential for loss. Provided you have three or four years planned expenditure in cash, I believe you should leave your portfolio alone and let the fund get on with its job of managing your money. I am 64, female and working full-time. I am living with my best friend – a male about my age – who is also working full-time. He owns an apartment in the same block as I do but does not like living alone. Accordingly, he asked me to come and live with him rent free as a companion. The relationship is purely platonic. We have separate bank accounts, separate cupboards for our food and each do our own washing. When I moved in, I rented out my own apartment, which is now an investment unit. He pays the ongoing costs of the apartment in which we live, and I pay all the costs of my apartment. He will never be eligible for a pension, but I should be eligible for a part pension when I stop work. I am trying to decide what I need to do now to prove that we are not a couple – just two individuals living in the same apartment. I am happy to sign a statutory declaration, if necessary. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Services Australia spokesperson Hank Jongen tells me that Centrelink payments can be made at either a partnered or single rate, depending on a person’s circumstances. Whether they are a couple, or just two people living together, is a matter of fact, and Centrelink will ask a series of questions about living arrangements to determine whether further assessment is required regarding the relationship. There is more great information on this topic at servicesaustralia.gov.au/moc. As the website points out: generally, there must be a physical and emotional separation. I contacted my super fund last week requesting to change my conservative balance option to cash. They said that they only do weekly share unit pricing, which would not come into effect for seven days. Actioning my instructions a week after the request could cost me significantly. I know they are now moving to daily unit share pricing, but I wondered about the legal and ethical effects of this policy. When you are investing in managed funds, such as superannuation, insurance bonds, or even property syndicates, it is almost impossible to access your money overnight. It is quite different to owning shares, where you can phone your broker and be cashed out of the market in minutes. The length of notice required depends on the fund. This would have been clearly stated in the product disclosure statement when you made the investment. Some funds have seven days, many have a month, and I have even seen some with six months. In my view, that is a good thing because it stops inexperienced investors trying to time the markets by jumping in and out of various investment options. History has shown this is a recipe for disaster. I read your interesting article about reverse mortgages some time ago. A friend has taken out a reverse mortgage with no intentions of paying it back until death. What kind of payments would she be confronted with if she did start paying it back after a five-year period? The position depends on the terms of the mortgage document. If the interest rate is variable, there should be no problem in making repayments if she wished but, if the rate is fixed for life, extra payments may not be allowed. It is a relatively simple matter to find out by talking with the lender.

I have placed $260,000 in a linked mortgage offset account. I now want to sell my original residence and pay off the mortgage on the second property. I know this will leave my partner and I with about $400,000. My partner is 71 and has no income or super. I will not sell the second property, as I regard it as my son’s family home. They will pay us a weekly rent of $400. I have been told that if I make my original home my primary residence again, I can avoid capital gains tax when selling. For how long would I have to live there before selling? H.B. You need to think things through before you make any moves.  Credit:Michael Mucci I assume you have been living off the rent from your former home. If this has been $400 a week after expenses, then you have been living on some $20,800 a year and would not be eligible for the age pension because of your two properties. If you sell your former home, you cannot eliminate Capital Gains Tax (CGT) by simply moving into it. Since you lived in it before renting it out for 14 years, your “cost base” for CGT purposes was the value when you moved out, $250,000, plus any capital expenses e.g. renovations, paid out since. If you sell it for $600,000 your capital gain will be some $350,000, reduced by selling expenses. You would then add half, say $175,000, to your taxable income that year and, assuming you have earned $15,000 in rent, tax would come to about $63,500. If you move back into the house for one year and then sell it after 15 years' ownership since losing the CGT exemption in 2006, you would only be exempt for the one year, and only 1/15th of your capital gain would be exempt. It gets more complicated. You would need to change all your mailing addresses, move all your possessions back into the old home and try to convince the Australian Taxation Office that you and your partner of 14 years can each claim a separate main residence exempt from CGT – and that could be problematical. The rule is that if you and your partner have different homes for a period, you must choose one of the homes, or each nominate the different homes as your main residences for the period. If you nominate different homes for the period and you own more than 50 per cent, your share is exempt for half the period you and your spouse have different homes, regardless of whether you are sole or joint owners. The same applies to your partner. If he owns more than 50 per cent of the home he nominates, his share is also exempt for only half the period you have different homes. This will probably not please your partner. You could gift your 2012 property and the money in the offset account to your son and then wait five years in order to claim a part age pension, but he would have to pay a huge CGT bill, plus stamp duty, so its probably not feasible. Your son is lucky to be able to live in a $1.3 million house with just a $140,000 net mortgage. I caution against selling the first property. It is your only source of income and, if you sell it to rely on your son, then if he loses his job, or falls ill, he must necessarily give priority to his wife and children and you would be in financial strife. I am aged 64 and self-employed. I have an account with First State Super and, to date, have not contributed any money into it. I recently sold an investment property which will give me a taxable capital gain of $150,000. If I do nothing, I will be liable for about $75,000 in income tax. What I would like to know is if I was to deposit $75,000 into my super account, will I be able to claim the full $75,000 as a tax deduction in my next tax return? If not, what is the maximum allowable tax deduction? J.C. Normally, the maximum annual concessional contribution you can make – and therefore the maximum tax deduction – is $25,000, assuming you have not contracted for a firm during 2019-20 that made employer super contributions for you, since they would count towards this cap. However, you may be in luck. This is the first financial year in which you can “carry forward” any unused concessional contributions from 2018-19. If you made no deductible contributions in 2018-19, you can add the full $25,000 to this year’s maximum, for a total of $50,000. To be eligible, your TSB must have been less than $500,000 as at June 30, 2019, which may be a problem, since you appear to be in the top tax bracket. In future, people may be able to carry forward up to five years of unused concessional contributions, but this of no use to you. The ATO wants its capital gains tax this year!

And finally, I’m still receiving wonderful emails saying you’ve called your bank and got a “2” in front of your interest rate. Bravo. This makes me so happy. So, to recap. In weeks 1 and 2, we price checked your mortgage and explored ways to save on household running costs, such as furnishings.  Householders can find cheaper energy providers online with a simple online click.Credit:Steve Cassell This week, it’s time to get you connected with some great home services, including electricity, gas, water, sewerage, phone and internet. Utilities, you see, are NOT BORING. They are modern miracles. The clue is in the word itself – utility – which literally means satisfaction, or happiness. Complaining about energy bills has become a national Australian sport – and with good foundation, as costs have soared. But, when you think about it, it’s a nice problem to have – at least, better than the alternative of not having access to these services at all. Indeed, before you start tackling you utility bills, it helps to pause a moment for appreciation. How wonderful it is to live in a country where our houses are, for the most part, connected to reliable networks of power distribution, which keep our lights on, our appliances running and our rooms heated and cooled to ambient temperature. How good is it that the pipes to our sinks and showers are pumped full of fresh, drinkable water. How nice to have toilets serviced by extensive sewerage systems, which both whisk away our malodorous unmentionables and protect us from the spread of disease and pestilence. Winning! Marvel still at the hundreds of thousands of kilometres of fibre optic and copper cables strewn across our great big land to deliver us high-speed internet services into our homes. Utilities. Are. Amazing. That being said, paying for these modern miracles eats up a sizeable chunk of your household budget, so it pays to not only use them sparingly, but to shop around for the best deal. First up, electricity. Want to save money? Go straight to energymadeeasy.gov.au and plug in your postcode and a few other minor details, and it will spit you out a list of the cheapest electricity plans in your area. When I did this late last year, it threw up 284 different plans. I simply plucked the name at the top of the list – a purely online retailer whom I’d never heard of before – and switched immediately from my big-name energy retailer to the no-contract little guy. I used to pay my big retailer a supply charge of 78.47 cents a day, plus a usage charge of 25.36 cents per kilowatt hour, giving me a total annual bill of about $1147 a year. Today, I pay a slightly higher supply charge of 84.85 cents a day, but a lower usage rate of 21.80 cents per kilowatt hour, costing me around $1050 a year. Thank you, government, for that easy $100 a year saving. Gas users can simply rinse and repeat the same process at energymadeeasy.gov.au to find similar savings. As for water and sewerage charges, there’s not much you can do. They’re usually monopoly provided and you just have to cop whatever they charge. Finally, there’s the cost of all your telecommunications technology. Fortunately for me, my mobile phone handset, calls and data are paid for by my work (and therefore, partly by you, dear reader – thank you). I’ve long since ditched my landline phone and use any number of free, Voice Over Internet services for most of my calls, including Facebook messenger, Skype, Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Whatsapp. Pick your poison. Which just leaves internet costs to budget for. The National Broadband Network has yet to grace my doorstep, so I’m somewhat limited in my choices. I recently downgrade my cable internet service from a $90 per month unlimited data plan to a $75 monthly plan with 500GB of data. I just wasn’t watching enough Netflix to need the extra data. To get the best deal on your telco services, the best place to start is the privately run website whistleout.com.au (thanks to Kill Bills author Joel Gibson for the tip!). They get a small fee if you click through to a provider, but it’s a good place to start. Many utility companies are also currently offering customers unlimited data and or repayment deferrals for coronavirus-affected households, so it’s worth checking with your provider.

Auction clearance rates have fallen off a cliff as buyers and sellers abandon the market in droves. Auctions and open house inspections have ceased in both NSW and Victoria; though online and phone auctions and one-on-one private inspections are still permitted. Auction clearance rates have plunged to record lows as bans on live auctions push real estate agents to run online sales. McGrath auctioneer Troy Malcolm takes bids during a live online auction on Saturday.Credit:Peter Rae More than 45 per cent of properties due to go to auction last weekend were withdrawn from sale, with the preliminary auction clearance rate plunging to just 48 per cent. Property researcher CoreLogic figures show that the clearance rate for the previous weekend was just 37.3 per cent – the lowest recorded since it commenced auction reporting data in 2008. Analysts say clearance rates are a leading indicator of major changes in property prices. Martin North, founder of Digital Finance Analytics, says even if the coronavirus-induced economic downturn is relatively short-lived, there could be property price falls of between 15 and 25 per cent over the next two or three years. ""If there's a longer-term crunch where the unemployment consequences and the failure of businesses is longer, then I think it could be 20 to 30 per cent,"" Mr North says. If the global disruption is prolonged, then it could top 45 per cent. However, the major price falls would not be uniform across the country and house prices are expected to hold up better than apartment values. ""Generally, houses hold their value more, other than the top end of the market, which is more volatile, and will do better than units,"" Mr North says. ""There are too many new [units], a lack of investors and there's a problem with [building] defects."" Hayden Dimes and Felicity Emmett, economists at ANZ bank, say the shutting down of auctions and home opens has seen both both buyers and sellers evaporate. ""As buyers and sellers dry up, we think properties that do trade through this shut-down period will see price falls,"" they say. The economists are expecting major price falls to start showing up as early as this month. Even when social distancing measures are removed, they say it is unlikely prices will bounce back. ""Despite enormous fiscal support, unemployment is still expected to rise sharply through this period and is unlikely to fully recover for some years,"" the ANZ economists say. Replay   Households are likely to have less appetite for debt, which would likely result in a slow recovery for house prices, they say. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, says higher levels of unemployment would trigger debt-servicing problems, which is bad news for property prices. This comes against a backdrop of very high household debt. He expects demand for property would be depressed for some time after the economic shutdown measures are relaxed. ""Hopefully, the federal government’s wage subsidy program will keep the rise in unemployment to below 10 per cent,"" Dr Oliver says. ""This, combined with various income-support measures and bank mortgage payment holidays, may serve to keep forced property selling to a minimum and price declines modest at around 5 per cent,"" he says. However, a long and deep coronavirus-driven downturn in the economy would point to a deeper property price slump of 20 per cent, or more, over the next 12 months, he says. More homebuyers, particularly those who purchased recently, will find that they are in ""negative equity"", where they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. However, for those who are able to hold onto their homes during the downturn, the losses in the value of their houses are on paper only. The banks’ mortgage deferrals mean most households with a home loan that see their incomes fall substantially will be able to get through the downturn without losing their home, says Trent Wiltshire, an economist at Domain. However, the banks ""will not let all customers defer loan repayments indefinitely"", he says. ""The big banks have said the deferral period is up to six months, but if the coronavirus recession drags on and people can’t return to work, this may not be long enough,"" Mr Wiltshire says.

23,/money/investing/seek-out-deep-value-opportunities-from-the-equities-pack-20200407-p54hwu.html,Seek out deep-value opportunities from the equities pack,"  Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, discusses the current market slide and where to from here in the following Q and A. You have said the time to buy into markets is when we are at peak fear. Which signals do you look at to ascertain this? It is impossible to pinpoint peaks and troughs. We do not believe we have any special knowledge or skill to divine peaks or troughs ahead of the pack, particularly in the short term. However, we do have the discipline to buy the assets people fear most and sell the assets that are most beloved. Rob Arnott.Credit:  Stocks will begin to recover long before the global coronavirus pandemic is on the wane. The strongest bull markets are not built on a foundation of good news, but on diminishing bad news. It will be hard to be perfectly right on the turning point, but don’t wait for good news – just wait until the pattern of bad news lets up.   When risk appetite returns, where should investors direct their attention first? Do you have any safe-haven strategies that investors can look at now? Consider averaging into newly cheaper and higher-yielding asset classes, especially Australian equities, and emerging market equities. Pare back on expensive assets, such as developed market sovereign debt.

You have said the time to buy into markets is when we are at peak fear. Which signals do you look at to ascertain this? It is impossible to pinpoint peaks and troughs. We do not believe we have any special knowledge or skill to divine peaks or troughs ahead of the pack, particularly in the short term. However, we do have the discipline to buy the assets people fear most and sell the assets that are most beloved. Rob Arnott.Credit:  Stocks will begin to recover long before the global coronavirus pandemic is on the wane. The strongest bull markets are not built on a foundation of good news, but on diminishing bad news. It will be hard to be perfectly right on the turning point, but don’t wait for good news – just wait until the pattern of bad news lets up.   When risk appetite returns, where should investors direct their attention first? Do you have any safe-haven strategies that investors can look at now? Consider averaging into newly cheaper and higher-yielding asset classes, especially Australian equities, and emerging market equities. Pare back on expensive assets, such as developed market sovereign debt.

We have seen a tremendous rush for liquidity. High-yield corporate bonds have been particularly hard hit.Credit:Rocco Fazzari Corporate bond prices have dropped to the point where there appears to be a massive disconnect between their fundamental value and the values trading in the market. Participants scrambling for cash are selling bonds at prices far below normal valuations. Changes to allow those in financial hardship to access their superannuation means super funds are also being driven to cash up by selling bonds. Lower risk “investment-grade” corporate bonds and higher risk “high-yield” corporate bonds have seen their prices plunge over the past six weeks. Even riskless assets, such as government bonds, have come under stress. Current corporate bond pricing may have significant economic implications, making it difficult for companies to efficiently raise funds, with the cost of capital high. This means they may make fewer investments and there will be less economic growth. Bond pricing is implying a dire future. If you take valuations as a direct sign of what the market expects, it says we are heading for a deep recession, with a large number of corporate defaults. The bonds from major banks such as NAB – and a large portion of the investment-grade universe (rated BBB and higher) – are most often large, well-capitalised investments. There is a high degree of confidence they will be repaid. The level of defaults in investment-grade bonds has traditionally been low, even under the most extreme of events, including the Global Financial Crisis and the 2000 recession. However, sellers now appear to be throwing valuation approaches out the window. Investment-grade bonds like NAB, which may have been trading at 100 cents in the dollar in February, were sold down to 95 cents in March. That doesn’t sound like a big move but it is for bonds. High-yield corporate bonds have been particularly hard hit. Some which normally trade at about 89 cents in the dollar are trading in the 50 cents in the dollar range. The disconnect gets wider with less-secure bonds. The more “credit heavy” the investment, the bigger the market punishment. Some of these are trading in the 40 cent range. We have seen wild price fluctuations, even in Australian government bonds. There was a mini “flash crash” in mid-March, with prices falling (yields higher) by 100 basis points in 60 seconds. That’s an enormous move, never seen before. For those comfortable with some risk and with a long-term horizon, there are significant opportunities. Returns in many credit sectors are higher than traditionally available in equities. We can’t predict the future and be assured a deep recession won’t come, but the credit market is pricing in a very pessimistic scenario and does not reflect the recovery of equities in recent weeks.

In other words, by the time everyone agrees that you should be investing, share prices will already have risen, perhaps precipitously so. So, here’s my view, for the record. I don’t know when the market will hit the bottom of the current downswing. For all we know, it may already have done so. I understand the psychological desire to limit short-term falls by waiting. However, by the time it becomes obvious we have passed the bottom and are climbing meaningfully, how much of the gains would you have already missed? Everyone thinks they will be the one who gets it right. Almost no-one does. So, try this, instead: We hit our most recent high in late February, when the ASX 200 index was around 7160 points. The market is so volatile, there is no telling what it will be by the time you read this, but let’s say 5200 or so. However, the ASX 200 has never failed to eventually regain, and surpass, its previous high. Sure it could go lower first, but if you have a long-term investing horizon – and you should – and if you think it is likely that it will regain 7160 at some point, there is almost a 40 per cent gain, plus dividends, on offer, just to get back to that previous high. And further rises on top of that are the cherry on the cake. Now, that doesn’t mean every company will go on to post those sorts of returns.

There are also concerns that some lenders may report the mortgage holder to credit-reporting agencies, which could affect their credit rating and ability to access loans in the future. The six-month deferrals on mortgage repayments being offered by lenders can be an expensive option.Credit:Paul Rovere The mortgage deferral calculation, made by RateCity, is based on an owner-occupier paying principal and interest at an average rate of 3.54 per cent, owing $500,000 with 25 years remaining on the loan. It assumes there are no changes in the interest rate over the life of the mortgage. Lenders are offering customers suffering financial hardship mortgage repayment deferrals on request as part of a unified response to the strains being put on household finances during the coronavirus crisis. Applications can be made online. Some require a ""check-in"" after three months, after which time an additional three-month payment ""holiday"" can usually be requested. Some extend the loan term, so the minimum required repayment remains the same as before the pause. Others keep the term the same. Following the deferral, the minimum repayment is increased. ANZ offers a choice of keeping the loan term the same or extending it by six months. The Commonwealth Bank said last week it will make a one-time payment to those receiving a home loan deferral, to offset the ""interest-on-interest costs"" over the six-month period. The figures from RateCity show that after the repayment pause, if the loan term were to remain the same, a borrower with a $500,000 mortgage would end up paying $7,662 extra over the remaining 24.5 year period. Their monthly repayments would increase by $77 a month. ""Extending your loan term can be a costly exercise,"" Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity, said. Many people are making higher repayments than required and, if they lower their repayments to the minimum, may not need to ask for a pause, she said. That would be preferable, as they will save on the interest costs of taking the deferral option. As an alternative, borrowers may be able to redraw any extra repayments they have made, to help tide them over during the cash-strapped period. It could also be worthwhile to ask your lender for a reduction in your mortgage interest rate and to waive fees, at least temporarily, Ms Tindall said. There are growing concerns in some circles that lenders may report mortgage holders that request a payment deferral to credit reporting agencies, which could affect their credit rating and ability to acquire future loans. Gerard Brody, chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, said those requesting a deferral should confirm with their lender that no ""black marks"" would appear on their credit records. Under the credit-reporting regime, late payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages of more than 14 days can hurt your credit score. Mr Brody said that as a pause in repayments is not an arrears, it should not be reported to credit agencies or affect credit scores. “However, it’s not clear that all lenders are adopting this position and consumer advocates are lobbying them to be consistent in their approach, so that mortgage deferrals do not negatively impact credit reports,” Mr Brody said. He said if borrowers feel they are not being treated fairly by their lender they should contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. If you have multiple debts and more complex issues, free financial counselling is available through the National Debt Helpline, Mr Brody said.

ANZ offers a choice of keeping the loan term the same or extending it by six months. The Commonwealth Bank said last week it will make a one-time payment to those receiving a home loan deferral, to offset the ""interest-on-interest costs"" over the six-month period. The figures from RateCity show that after the repayment pause, if the loan term were to remain the same, a borrower with a $500,000 mortgage would end up paying $7,662 extra over the remaining 24.5 year period. Their monthly repayments would increase by $77 a month. ""Extending your loan term can be a costly exercise,"" Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity, said. Many people are making higher repayments than required and, if they lower their repayments to the minimum, may not need to ask for a pause, she said. That would be preferable, as they will save on the interest costs of taking the deferral option. As an alternative, borrowers may be able to redraw any extra repayments they have made, to help tide them over during the cash-strapped period. It could also be worthwhile to ask your lender for a reduction in your mortgage interest rate and to waive fees, at least temporarily, Ms Tindall said. There are growing concerns in some circles that lenders may report mortgage holders that request a payment deferral to credit reporting agencies, which could affect their credit rating and ability to acquire future loans. Gerard Brody, chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, said those requesting a deferral should confirm with their lender that no ""black marks"" would appear on their credit records. Under the credit-reporting regime, late payments on credit cards, personal loans and mortgages of more than 14 days can hurt your credit score. Mr Brody said that as a pause in repayments is not an arrears, it should not be reported to credit agencies or affect credit scores. “However, it’s not clear that all lenders are adopting this position and consumer advocates are lobbying them to be consistent in their approach, so that mortgage deferrals do not negatively impact credit reports,” Mr Brody said. He said if borrowers feel they are not being treated fairly by their lender they should contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. If you have multiple debts and more complex issues, free financial counselling is available through the National Debt Helpline, Mr Brody said.

35,/money/borrowing/ominous-signs-the-property-market-is-running-out-of-steam-and-fast-20200401-p54g3r.html,Ominous signs the property market is running out of steam - and fast,"The news from CoreLogic that residential property values continued to climb in March looks positive at first blush but a deeper delve shows signs are starting to emerge that this market is running out of steam - and fast. The bottom line is that all bets are off when it comes to predicting what will happen to house values over the coming year. Until a month ago economists were looking for gains of between 5 and 10 per cent in values this year. At best this will evaporate. At worst prices could fall 20 per cent, according to AMP chief economist Shane Oliver. House prices are under threat from the  pandemic.Credit:AAP Halfway through March the growth rates in values halved - an ominous harbinger. This probably reflected a fall in demand as confidence from would-be buyers didn’t just slump, it evaporated. The bans imposed on live auctions and restrictions on inspections are a bit of a side issue given most properties are sold by private treaty. The bigger dilemma for estimating home values is that the falling number of transactions makes it difficult to assess what is really happening to house prices - the market is not deep enough to provide real statistical evidence. And property markets tend to lag real-time because there is a longer settlement period on transactions. So there are simply not enough data points between the full coronavirus onslaught and now. On the demand side, it is completely understandable that buyers have pulled back. We are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis with an unpredictable recovery and most financial experts would advise households to retain liquidity and not increase their debt. Cashed-up investors or even first home buyers (who felt their job was secure) could opportunistically seize bargains but most people will take Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s advice and financially hibernate. Household balance sheets were highly leveraged going into this crisis and now feels like a good time to keep their powder dry. The demand side of the equation is more complex. The good news is that the federal government and the banks have come to the party. Borrowers affected by the pandemic can put mortgage payments on ice for six months, which will take the pressure off forced sales. And the government's stimulus package will ensure workers will get a wage allowance if they have been affected by coronavirus. Regardless of this, Australia is predicted to move towards higher unemployment which will undermine property market values.   ""Prices are likely to fall as unemployment rises, triggering debt servicing problems for some against the backdrop of very high household debt levels and high house prices in Australia and depressing property demand even for a while after the shutdowns are relaxed,"" Oliver says. Additionally those small to medium sized company owners who are typical residential property investors will be looking for liquidity. They will also be feeling the pinch if their rental tenants are unable to meet monthly payments. And after six months they will need to start paying interest again. Bank largesse won’t continue indefinitely. How the economy looks in six months and the extent to which businesses have recovered will dictate whether there will be a spike in supply of investment properties being put up for sale. If so there will be additional pressure on property prices. Those forecasting a U-shaped recovery for business will be more optimistic about the property market. ""Hopefully, the federal government’s wage subsidy program will keep the rise in unemployment to below 10 per cent and this, combined with various income support measures and bank mortgage payment holidays, will serve to keep forced property selling to a minimum and price declines modest at around 5 per cent,"" Oliver says. But he warned that a long and deep downturn in the economy that pushes unemployment well above 10 per cent and results in a gradual decline, combined with a significant increase in financial stress for stretched landlords as tenants struggle to pay rents, would point to a deeper property price downturn of 20 per cent or so over the next 12 months. The absence of new migrants for the next six months or so will also act as a drag on property demand. The Sydney market is most at risk given higher debt-to-income ratios and a greater supply overhang. How the coronavirus pandemic will treat residential property values would be the second-hottest topic around Zoom dinner party tables.

36,/money/saving/coronavirus-crisis-how-your-telco-can-help-20200330-p54fce.html,Coronavirus crisis: How your telco can help,"By now, there is a good chance you fall into one of two categories: you’re either working from home, or no longer working at all. Whichever it is, we’ve never been more dependent on our phone companies. With so many of us working from home, we have never been more reliant on our telco providers.Credit:iStock We’re going to need our telcos to give us as much value as they can for as little cost as possible in the coming months as we deal with the COVID-19 crisis – even if some customers may struggle to afford to pay them. In the past two weeks, more than half a million people have signed a change.org petition  calling for governments and the banks to “freeze all mortgages, rent and bills for casual workers and full time employees affected by the downturn since COVID-19”. More than 60 community organisations also called for businesses to stop disconnections, debt collections and late fees. So, what are Aussie telcos doing to help their customers during the crisis? Replay   Telstra has about half of all telco customers and, to its credit, moved early to suspend late payment fees and disconnections until the end of April, to help small business and personal customers who are struggling. It also gave consumer and small business broadband customers unlimited data until April 30. Post-paid mobile customers can apply for an extra, free 25GB data via the Telstra app. Pre-paid mobile customers with an active recharge of $40 can get 10GB of additional free data. Eligible pensioners with a home phone plan will get unlimited local, national and 13/1300 calls, and calls to mobiles, until April 30. Optus moved early, too, giving eligible mobile subscribers 20GB of free extra data in April and pre-paid customers 10GB of free extra data if they top up for more than $40 during April. It says most of their broadband customers are already on unlimited plans. Customers – including small businesses – can also put their plan on hold for free. Late payment fees, disconnections and debt collection are on hold until April 30. Because of call centre impacts, the best way to contact them if you are in trouble is online via Optus Livechat. Vodafone will not be charging any late payment fees and won’t be suspending any services until after April, and offered its customers extra mobile data, unlimited standard calls and unmetered use of Centrelink and health websites. Postpaid customers not already on unlimited plans get an automatic 5GB data bonus to use over the next month. Pre-paid customers get a 3GB bonus with your next recharge. Amaysim gave unlimited mobile data to anyone on its $40+ plans, and 10GB-30Gb bonuses to smaller plans. Superloop upgraded all broadband plans to unlimited data and Aussie Broadband did the same between 6am and 6pm. Telco guru and author Joe Hanlon says if you are short of broadband data or speed, moving up a tier usually costs just $10-$20 a month – if you can afford it for a few months. “With mobile networks, data usage is a much greater concern, as the cost of exceeding your limits can sting,” he says, so check your mobile usage. If you are at home, do it with wifi. The big question is where to next for Aussie telcos? Most have April plans but they will need May plans, too. Overseas, government relief for bills has mostly focussed on mortgages, rent and energy. However, keeping Aussies connected – whether they can afford it or not – should also be a top priority.

39,/money/super-and-retirement/the-benefits-of-setting-up-a-special-disability-trust-20200407-p54hvu.html,The benefits of setting up a Special Disability Trust,"Special Disability Trusts (SDTs) enable you to provide for the accommodation and care needs of a family member with a severe disability or medical condition. The word “special” is not about the person’s care needs, rather it is about the concessions that can apply to people who gift to the trust (known as donors), as well as for the beneficiary. Special Disability Trusts can provide great benefits, but make sure you seek specialist legal and financial advice first.Credit:Think Stock To be the principal beneficiary of a SDT you must meet one of three definitions of “severe disability.” Almost anyone can gift any amount to the trust, the exceptions being the settlor of the trust, who cannot gift at all, and the principal beneficiary (or their partner), who can only gift a superannuation death benefit or bequest within three years of its receipt. No compensation monies, whether from the beneficiary or on their behalf, can be gifted to the trust. There are a number of benefits of setting up a SDT. People who are immediate family members, who have reached age pension age and receive a pension, such as the Age Pension or Carer Payment, can get a gifting concession of up to $500,000. For example, an eligible grandparent may contribute $300,000, leaving $200,000 which could still be claimed. If the $300,000 was in excess of the pension asset threshold, then the grandparent’s pension could go up by more than $23,000 a year, as a result of the gift. For the principal beneficiary, the assessable assets of the trust up to $681,750 are exempt for both pension and aged-care asset tests and the income earned by the trust and distributions from it are exempt from the income tests. For example, someone living in aged care who receives an inheritance of $700,000 may face losing their Age pension and an increase in their means tested care fee of almost $40 a day. Placing the bulk of the inheritance in a SDT could provide an increase in their pension of $24,500 a year and a reduction in their cost of aged care of $14,000 a year. An SDT also receives concessional tax treatment, with a Capital Gains Tax exemption for assets transferred to it. Unspent earnings of the trust are taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate. While getting funds into the trust is fairly simple, getting funds out can be harder. The purpose of the SDT is to provide for the accommodation and care needs of the principal beneficiary. Withdrawals are limited to uses that meet those needs – and a modest level of discretionary spending of $12,250 each financial year. The trust cannot be used to directly benefit family members or pay them to provide care. Watch out for the ""look back"" on gifts to the trust within five years of the beneficiary passing away. Under these rules, the donor would need to receive back what they have contributed (in proportion to the value of the trust at that time). If they don’t, it can be assessed under the gifting rules. Special Disability Trusts can provide great benefits, but make sure you seek specialist legal and financial advice first before setting one up.

40,/money/super-and-retirement/looming-p-and-i-loan-conversions-a-ticking-time-bomb-20200406-p54hh8.html,Looming P&I loan conversions a ticking time bomb,"A friend has just had his interest-only loan converted to a principle-and-interest loan, with the payments increasing from $4000 per month to $9000 per month. This has put extreme stress on his finances. I believe, in these trying times, lending institutions should be prevailed upon by the government to do their bit by not converting loans from interest only to P&I. What do you think? This is a very timely question, given that the nearly 800,000 interest-only loans that are coming up for renewal in the next nine months are a ticking time bomb. Illustration: Simon LetchCredit:  Unfortunately, the statements put out by bank executives do not seem to match what is happening on the ground. I suggest your friend go back to his bank and ask them to continue the loan on an interest-only basis, in view of the unique economic circumstances the world is facing. If that is not effective, contact me again, and I will look at giving the situation maximum publicity in the hope we can help your friend and the many others in the same situation. My wife and I are self-funded retirees who, until now, have not claimed any pension entitlements – except for the Low Income Health Card. I am aged 66 and my wife is 60. The balance in my superannuation income account has dropped to about $730,000. My wife also has an accumulation account with a balance of about $5000. We draw a monthly pension of $4167 from my income account, as well as random lump sums to cover items such as holidays, motor vehicles, home improvements etc. It has been suggested that I transfer $300,000 from my income account to my wife's account to reduce my assessable assets and apply for a part age pension. Is this course of action advisable? Are there are any hidden implications, such as any tax payable? As you are 66, you could certainly withdraw $300,000 tax-free and your wife could contribute that to her super using the three year bring forward rule. It would then not be counted by Centrelink until she reaches pensionable age. A bonus of this strategy would be that you are converting a large part of the taxable component of your super to non-taxable component in your wife’s name – this could dramatically reduce the death tax down the track. I wonder, with super returns currently in the negative, is it a good time to be making extra contributions? I am with an industry fund and have some money coming from my mum’s estate soon, which I want to maintain the value of (I’d hate to see it dwindling away). I think this is the perfect time to be making extra contributions to super, especially if you have a long timeframe, such as 25 years or more. Don’t forget, you can now contribute a total of $25,000 a year to super as a tax-deductible concessional contribution. This does include the employer contribution, so you would need to deduct that first to make sure you don’t make excess contributions. You can also make much larger contributions from after-tax dollars. I am aged 63 and retired. If I make a withdrawal from my super fund, do I have to pay tax, and also declare it on my 2020 tax return? Furthermore, do I need to state which portion is tax-free and which portion is taxable. As you are over 60, any withdrawals should be tax-free and nothing needs to be included on your tax return. Your super will almost certainly have taxable and non-taxable components, but the withdrawal will be made on a pro-rata basis, based on the two separate amounts. You cannot elect which component is to be withdrawn. However, that is only relevant when calculating the death tax if your super happens to be left to a non-dependent. Hopefully, that’s a long way down the track. I have a Self-Managed Super Fund which owns property and I want to give my tenant, who is a related party, a reduction in their rent because of the current financial situation. I understand that this would normally be a contravention of super regulations and wonder what the attitude of the Australian Taxation Office would be to this situation. The ATO has confirmed that for the 2019–20 and 2020–21 financial years they will not take action where a SMSF gives a tenant – who is also a related party – a temporary rent reduction. Therefore, what you propose should be fine.
