The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by UN special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.

The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities. The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen.

Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces. Last week, UN envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen. Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace."" A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the US Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"". The UN and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities. Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Saudi Vice-Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $US500 million ($800 million) to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $US25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. The United Nations appealed for more than $US4 billion in 2019 for the humanitarian crisis and is expected to ask again for several billion dollars in 2020.

While acknowledging that he would not secure enough delegates to win the party's nomination, Sanders said his progressive movement was winning the ideological and generational fight within the Democratic Party. Replay   In a live-streamed address to supporters, Sanders said it was a ""difficult and painful"" decision to suspend his campaign, but that Biden's substantial delegate lead and the coronavirus pandemic had forced his hand. ""I wish I could give you better news but I think you know the truth and that is that we're now some 300 delegates behind vice-president Biden and the path to victory is virtually impossible,"" Sanders said on Wednesday (Thursday AEST). ""I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign I cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour."" He continued: ""If I believed we had a feasible path to the nomination, I would certainly continue the campaign. But it's just not there."" Sanders said he and his supporters had moved ideas recently considered ""radical and fringe"" - such as a universal healthcare system provided by the federal government - to the centre of US political debate. Sanders' withdrawal will pave the way for high-profile Democrats such as former president Barack Obama to endorse Biden, who staged a remarkable comeback after disastrous early performances in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""Bernie has done something rare in politics,"" Biden said. ""He hasn’t just run a political campaign; he’s created a movement. And make no mistake about it, I believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday."" As recently as late February, Sanders appeared the most likely Democratic candidate to secure the party's nomination. He had won the most votes in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, before crushing his competition in the Nevada caucuses. His campaign rallies drew the biggest crowds and his online fundraising abilities were unmatched. Replay   But Biden revived his flagging campaign with a resounding victory in South Carolina, where African Americans form the dominant voting bloc.

The former vice-president then put in a formidable performance in the vital ""Super Tuesday"" contests and continued claiming victory in subsequent primaries. One of Biden's next jobs will be to decide who to pick as a running mate for vice-president. He has indicated that person will be a woman, but there are several potential candidates, among them three senators: California's Kamala Harris, who sparred with him in a debate, is seen by many as a logical choice;  Amy Klobuchar, who dropped out of the presidential nomination race to allow Biden to win in her state of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts who overlaps with Sanders on many policies and could help Biden retain some Sanders' supporters.

Here's why,"Washington: US President Donald Trump unleashed a tirade against the World Health Organisation on Tuesday, accusing it of acting too slowly to sound the alarm about the coronavirus. It was not the first time in this pandemic that the global health body has faced such criticism. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organisation.Credit:Bloomberg Government officials, health experts and analysts have in recent weeks raised concerns about how the organisation has responded to the outbreak. In Japan, Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, recently noted that some people have started referring to the World Health Organisation as the ""Chinese Health Organisation"" because of what he described as its close ties to Beijing. Taiwanese officials say the WHO ignored its early warnings about the virus because China refuses to allow Taiwan, a self-governing island it claims as its territory, to become a member. Critics say the WHO has been too trusting of the Chinese government, which initially tried to conceal the outbreak in Wuhan. Others have faulted the organisation and its leader, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for moving too slowly in declaring a global health emergency. The WHO, a UN agency, has defended its response, saying on Wednesday that it alerted the world to the threat posed by the virus in a timely manner and that it was ""committed to ensuring all member states are able to respond effectively to this pandemic"". The agency's defenders say that its powers over any individual government are limited, and that it has done the best it can in dealing with a public health threat with few precedents in history. There will be time later to assess successes and failings, ""this virus and its shattering consequences,"" the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday in a statement praising the WHO as ""absolutely critical"" to vanquishing COVID-19. Here's why the WHO is coming under attack. Replay   When cases of a mysterious viral pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan in December, Chinese health officials silenced whistleblowers and repeatedly played down the severity of the outbreak. Even as late as mid-January, as the virus spread beyond China's borders, Chinese officials described it as ""preventable and controllable"" and said there was no evidence it could be transmitted between humans on a broad scale. The WHO endorsed the government's claims, saying in mid-January, for example, that human-to-human transmission had not been proven. Critics say the organisation's repeated deference to Beijing exacerbated the spread of the disease. A group of international experts was not allowed to visit Wuhan until mid-February. ""They could have been more forceful, especially in the initial stages in the crisis when there was a cover-up and there was inaction,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert specialising in China at Seton Hall University. Chinese health officials in protective suits process Wuhan travellers going into 14-day quarantine on arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.Credit:Getty Images Huang noted that during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, which killed less than 800 people worldwide, the WHO pushed the Chinese government to be more transparent by publicly criticising it for trying to conceal the outbreak. At one point during the SARS epidemic, officials at hospitals in Beijing forced SARS patients into ambulances and drove them around to avoid their being seen by a visiting delegation of WHO experts, according to reports at the time. Even as the virus spread to more than half a dozen countries and forced China to place parts of Hubei province under lockdown in late January, the WHO was reluctant to declare it a global health emergency. WHO officials said at the time that a committee that discussed the epidemic was divided on whether to call it an emergency but concluded that it was too early. One official added that they weighed the impact such a declaration might have on the people of China. After the United States announced a ban on most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, the WHO again seemed to show deference to Chinese officials, saying that travel restrictions were unnecessary. The group officially called the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. Some experts argue that the institution's delay in making such declarations deprived other countries of valuable time to prepare hospitals for an influx of patients. ""It reinforced the reluctance to take early strong measures before the catastrophe had actually landed on other shores,"" said François Godement, senior adviser for Asia at Institut Montaigne, a non-profit group in Paris. ""The WHO's tardiness or reluctance to call out the problem in full helped those who wanted to delay difficult decisions."" The WHO defended its actions, saying on Wednesday that it had ""alerted member states to the significant risks and consequences of COVID-19 and provided them with a continuous flow of information"" ever since Chinese officials first reported the outbreak on December 31. Guterres said, ""It is possible that the same facts have had different readings by different entities. ""Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe and how all those involved reacted to the crisis."" President Donald Trump said the WHO is ""very China-centric"".Credit:AP Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it a priority to strengthen Beijing's clout at international institutions, including the WHO, seeing the US-dominated global order as an impediment to his country's rise as a superpower. China contributes only a small fraction of the WHO's $US6 billion ($9.6 billion) budget, while the United States is one of its main benefactors. But in recent years, Beijing has worked in other ways to expand its influence at the organisation. It has lobbied the WHO to promote traditional Chinese medicine, which Xi has worked to harness as a source of national pride and deployed as a soft-power tool in developing countries, despite scepticism from some scientists about its effectiveness. Last year, the WHO offered an endorsement of traditional Chinese medicine, including it in its influential medical compendium. The move was roundly criticised by animal welfare activists, who argued that it could contribute to a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife whose parts are used in Chinese remedies.

Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald's newsletter here and The Age's here. China has sought to promote traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of symptoms of the coronavirus both at home and abroad. Last month, the WHO was criticised after it removed a warning against taking traditional herbal remedies to treat the coronavirus from its websites in mainland China. China's role at the WHO will probably continue to grow in the coming years, especially if Western governments retreat from the organisation, as Trump has threatened. ""This is part of China's efforts to more actively engage in international institutions,"" said Huang, the global health expert.

Chinese health officials in protective suits process Wuhan travellers going into 14-day quarantine on arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.Credit:Getty Images Huang noted that during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, which killed less than 800 people worldwide, the WHO pushed the Chinese government to be more transparent by publicly criticising it for trying to conceal the outbreak. At one point during the SARS epidemic, officials at hospitals in Beijing forced SARS patients into ambulances and drove them around to avoid their being seen by a visiting delegation of WHO experts, according to reports at the time. Even as the virus spread to more than half a dozen countries and forced China to place parts of Hubei province under lockdown in late January, the WHO was reluctant to declare it a global health emergency. WHO officials said at the time that a committee that discussed the epidemic was divided on whether to call it an emergency but concluded that it was too early. One official added that they weighed the impact such a declaration might have on the people of China. After the United States announced a ban on most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, the WHO again seemed to show deference to Chinese officials, saying that travel restrictions were unnecessary. The group officially called the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. Some experts argue that the institution's delay in making such declarations deprived other countries of valuable time to prepare hospitals for an influx of patients. ""It reinforced the reluctance to take early strong measures before the catastrophe had actually landed on other shores,"" said François Godement, senior adviser for Asia at Institut Montaigne, a non-profit group in Paris. ""The WHO's tardiness or reluctance to call out the problem in full helped those who wanted to delay difficult decisions."" The WHO defended its actions, saying on Wednesday that it had ""alerted member states to the significant risks and consequences of COVID-19 and provided them with a continuous flow of information"" ever since Chinese officials first reported the outbreak on December 31. Guterres said, ""It is possible that the same facts have had different readings by different entities. ""Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe and how all those involved reacted to the crisis."" President Donald Trump said the WHO is ""very China-centric"".Credit:AP Chinese President Xi Jinping has made it a priority to strengthen Beijing's clout at international institutions, including the WHO, seeing the US-dominated global order as an impediment to his country's rise as a superpower. China contributes only a small fraction of the WHO's $US6 billion ($9.6 billion) budget, while the United States is one of its main benefactors. But in recent years, Beijing has worked in other ways to expand its influence at the organisation. It has lobbied the WHO to promote traditional Chinese medicine, which Xi has worked to harness as a source of national pride and deployed as a soft-power tool in developing countries, despite scepticism from some scientists about its effectiveness. Last year, the WHO offered an endorsement of traditional Chinese medicine, including it in its influential medical compendium. The move was roundly criticised by animal welfare activists, who argued that it could contribute to a surge in illegal trafficking of wildlife whose parts are used in Chinese remedies.

China has sought to promote traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of symptoms of the coronavirus both at home and abroad. Last month, the WHO was criticised after it removed a warning against taking traditional herbal remedies to treat the coronavirus from its websites in mainland China. China's role at the WHO will probably continue to grow in the coming years, especially if Western governments retreat from the organisation, as Trump has threatened. ""This is part of China's efforts to more actively engage in international institutions,"" said Huang, the global health expert. ""It will not please every country or every actor, but it's going to affect the agenda of the WHO."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Javier C. Hernández ,"April 9, 2020"
10,/world/north-america/a-civic-catastrophe-wisconsin-elections-go-ahead-despite-pandemic-20200408-p54i33.html,'A civic catastrophe': Wisconsin elections go ahead despite pandemic,"Washington: Six million people in Wisconsin, in the US Midwest, are currently living under an order requiring them to stay at home except for essential reasons - like visiting the pharmacy or grocery store. But despite these tough social distancing rules, Wisconsinites went to the polls on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) to vote in the Democratic presidential primary and a series of local elections. Voters wait in line to vote at Riverside High School in Milwaukee for Wisconsin's primary election. Credit:AP Unlike 15 other states which have opted to postpone their planned primaries, Wisconsin ploughed ahead with the scheduled date. Tony Evers, the state's Democratic Governor, wanted to delay in-person voting until June, but was blocked by the Republican-controlled state legislature and the Supreme Court. The legislature also rejected Evers' plan to make it easier for all the state's residents to vote by mail. The sight of Wisconsinites waiting in long lines to cast ballots and poll workers wearing HAZMAT suits stunned many Americans. Should citizens in a democracy, they asked, really have to choose between their safety and their right to vote? One widely-circulated image showed a voter, wearing a mask while waiting in line, with a cardboard sign saying: ""This is ridiculous"". Politico called Tuesday's election ""a civic catastrophe that never should have happened"". The New York Times described the decision to proceed with voting as ""insane, and utterly unnecessary"". Because of concerns about the coronavirus, there was a huge drop in the number of poll workers willing to show up to administer the elections. This led to a massive reduction in the number of polling places and, in turn, longer than usual lines. In Milwaukee, the state's biggest city, the number of polling places dropped from 180 to just five. Susan Rice, Barack Obama's former national security adviser, responded to a Twitter image of long lines in Milwaukee with a one-word reply: ""Evil"". To those familiar with the bitter partisanship that has dominated Wisconsin's recent politics, the state's idiosyncratic decision to carry out the election was not so surprising. A poll worker sprays down a voting booth after use inside the polling location at Riverside High School  in Milwaukee.Credit:Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel Wisconsin is almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, which heightens the intensity of electoral contests. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by just 0.77 per cent of the vote in Wisconsin in 2016. The state's officials have aggressively ""purged"" voters from electoral rolls and introduced tough voter identification laws that require residents to show a driver's licence or other photo ID in order to cast a ballot. Wisconsin is also a hot spot for ""gerrymandering"", the phenomenon where politicians draw electoral boundaries to help ensure their re-election. In the 2018 state legislature elections, Democrats won 53 per cent of the votes but received just 34 per cent of seats. Sisters Kelly and Teal Rowe work behind a plexiglass barrier while waiting to verify voters at the town's highway garage facility in Dunn, Wisconsin.Credit:AP If Tuesday's vote had simply been a Democratic primary, Republican politicians may not have been so insistent on going ahead with the election. But they were concerned about another election held on the same day: a contest for a seat on the state's Supreme Court. The race pitted a conservative judge, Daniel Kelly, against a progressive challenger Jill Karofsky. Republicans hope that low voter turnout in urban areas will help keep the seat in conservative hands. While the battle over voting rights in Wisconsin is especially intense, it reflects a bigger battle playing out between Democrats and Republicans ahead of November's presidential election. If the virus is still circulating or has re-appeared by then, the same issues will emerge again. Democrats are pushing for federal legislation that would allow all Americans to vote by mail in November. Republicans reject that idea, saying it is up to states to make electoral laws and that mail-in ballots are prone to fraud. Asked recently if he supported voting by mail, Trump said: ""No, because I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting... It should not be mailed in. You should vote at the booth, and you should have voter ID."" Matthew Knott is North America correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Copyright © 2020", Matthew Knott ,"April 8, 2020"
11,/world/north-america/trump-s-off-the-rails-briefings-test-america-s-patience-20200407-p54hst.html,Trump's 'off the rails' coronavirus briefings test America's patience,"Washington: Just before 7.30pm on Monday (Tuesday AEST) Deborah Birx walked to the lectern at the White House briefing room. The physician, who is co-ordinating the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus, was there to present the latest national data on the pandemic and advise Americans about how to keep themselves safe. Replay   But most Americans - even if they were tuned in to cable news at the time - never saw Birx speak. The daily briefing had already been going for two hours, dominated by a fiery question-and-answer session between US President Donald Trump and reporters. By the time Birx was called upon to give her update, two of the three main cable news channels, CNN and MSNBC, had already switched back to regular programming. Only Fox News was still airing the press conference. The White House's bloated briefings - which commonly last longer than your average feature film, if not yet Martin Scorsese's The Irishman - are increasingly testing the patience of news broadcasters. Even some of Trump's most loyal Republican allies want them to be dramatically cut back. President Donald Trump reacts as Dr Deborah Birx  speaks about her granddaughter's fever.Credit:AP Trump can be accused of many things, but not of hiding from the media. He usually takes multiple rounds of questions from the reporters in the room - even those he disparages as ""fake news"". As the televisual equivalent of a mood ring, the briefings are extremely useful. Each day you see Trump's feelings about the pandemic shift - from dismissive to serious to frustrated and back again.  But as a vehicle for delivering facts and information about the outbreak, the briefings are becoming increasingly ineffective. Health experts like Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci now resemble film extras, standing silently for hours at a time as Trump commands the podium. Presumably, they have other important things to do. The first hour of a briefing last week wasn't even about the coronavirus, but the Trump administration's efforts to halt the illegal drug trade. And for all Trump's showmanship, they don't necessarily create news - even as they run for hours. The main purpose of the briefings, it appears, is to keep Trump on prime-time TV for as long as possible and to deny media oxygen to anyone else, including his likely presidential rival Joe Biden. Around midday on Sunday, the White House press office called a ""lid"" - meaning Trump did not have any public events on his schedule for the rest of the day. Five hours later, reporters were told to assemble at the White House. Trump and the members of the coronavirus taskforce would give a daily briefing after all. At 7pm, when TV ratings are at their highest, Trump appeared and spoke for two hours - even though he didn't have anything new to say. His briefing coincided precisely with a livestreamed Biden coronavirus event that had been announced the day before. The main news takeaway was that Trump again hyped up hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, as a potential treatment for the virus. When reporters tried to ask Fauci for his opinion on the drug, Trump refused to let him answer. This week Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a staunch Trump loyalist, said the President should let health experts like Birx and Fauci take the lead at the briefings. ""And so sometimes I think it goes off the rails a little bit,"" she said. ""But you know, that’s the way the President conducts business.""

This new tradition is a chance for us to emerge from our domestic bubbles and thank the Peruvian emergency workers risking their health to keep the bones of society running. Our condominium’s doormen, who have stayed on to ensure our security at this insecure time, have taken to unfurling a giant Peruvian flag and doing a lap of the complex, holding it aloft. A football player looks over Pamplona shanty town in Lima, Peru, on March 13.Credit:AP One neighbour cranks his stereo, belting out a classic Creole song, ""Contigo Peru"" (Together with you Peru). Children who would normally spend every afternoon in the park together, riding bikes, playing football, being kids, strain against the handrails to see one other and shout out cabin-fevered greetings. When the applause dies down, everyone goes back inside and the buzz of community is shattered by the sound of the choppers. The army is out in force, searchlights on, looking for people breaking curfew. Between 6pm and 5am, you are not allowed out. If you have an emergency, you must leave waving a white flag. You will be stopped. Unless you have a genuine emergency, you will be arrested. Army presence on the streets is unnerving to this Australian, now trapped here since the borders closed on March 15 and we all went into lockdown, but Peru is a nationalistic country with terrorism in its history and what feels extreme is accepted as necessary here. What is more jarring for locals is the sight of people in protective gear, standing two metres apart and lining up around the block to buy groceries in daylight hours. Peruvians with their Latin warmth are not known for keeping their distance. Here queuing politely is not a thing and the loosest of acquaintances will greet you with a kiss on the cheek. People in Lima, Peru, show their appreciation for health workers during the coronavirus pandemic. As stressful as home detention is in an apartment with six people and two dogs, we are privileged. We have electricity and running water, a secure income and good healthcare. We have Netflix. I have to teach online with a baby on my lap and my daughter chastising the dog, but millions of Peruvians face challenges to their very survival. Just a few kilometres away, people in the shanty towns have no access to water and no pay cheque now the economy has effectively shut down – people who normally live on about $10 a day, with no savings and no safety net. How this will affect Lima's future security is of grave concern. Amid all this uncertainty, all we can do is stay home and emerge on to our balconies every night at 8pm, to support those fighting COVID-19 – and to support each other.

Senator Kamala Harris, a possible choice for Biden.Credit:AP The next big question - beyond when and how Biden will be formally nominated amid a pandemic - is who is going to fill out the ticket as Biden's running mate. The pick carries unusual importance, especially given that Biden, who will turn 78 shortly after Election Day, would be the oldest US president ever elected. We already know one thing about that pick: It will be a woman, as Biden pledged in a recent debate. Below is a ranking of who makes the most sense to be that running mate. Hers may be the most outside-the-box name on this list, but Susan Rice has the resume. She served on the National Security Council and in a high-ranking State Department role in the Clinton administration, and she was United Nations ambassador and national security adviser in the Obama administration. She's also an African American woman and has recently shown an interest in elective politics, considering a run against Senator Susan Collins. The one most obvious drawback: She was in line to possibly become Obama's secretary of state but withdrew after the Benghazi, Libya, attack threatened to make her confirmation ""lengthy, disruptive and costly"", in her words. She had come under sharp criticism for being misleading about the nature of that attack. That may not be a deal breaker, but her public pronouncements turned her into a lightning rod, and Republicans would be happy to make Benghazi an issue again. Then national security adviser Susan Rice in 2016.Credit:AP New Mexico's governor won't be a familiar name to many who follow national politics, nor is her state a battleground. But Michelle Lujan Grisham is among the relatively few Hispanic women who currently serve in high office in the United States. Stacey Abrams remains a popular possibility given that she ran a strong campaign for Georgia governor in 2018. But she's still someone who hasn't served in any office beyond the state legislature. It also may be tempting for Biden to pick her in hopes of putting an increasingly purple [red-blue mixed] state in play - and some polls have suggested that's not totally outside the realm of possibility - but you do wonder how much of a priority that will be, ahead of more-competitive states. Senator Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, arguably checks more boxes when it comes to her profile than anyone on this list. She's a senator, a Purple Heart recipient who lost both of her legs in Iraq and was the first disabled women elected to Congress. In 2018, she became the first US senator to give birth while in office. And she's got a diverse background as the daughter of a Thai mother of Chinese descent. She was one of the most hyped Democratic House candidates in the 2006 election but lost in a good Democratic year (albeit in a tough district). She was later elected to the House and went on to defeat Senator Mark Kirk by 14 percentage points in 2016, while Hillary Clinton carried her state by 17. Replay   The only House member on the list, Val Demings got her first taste of the national spotlight when she served as one of the House impeachment managers. She's also an African American and former police chief of a major city, Orlando, in Florida. Like Duckworth in 2006, though, she was a much-hyped House candidate in the 2012 election and lost. She went on to run for mayor of Orange County, Florida, but dropped out in 2015. She has also been in federal office for just over three years.

Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was elected to the Senate in 2016 and previously served as Nevada's attorney-general for two terms. Winning Nevada shouldn't be an issue for Democrats, as it has trended to the left in recent years. But it wouldn't hurt to have an insurance policy. This is the first pick on this list that comes from one of the true battleground states. Tammy Baldwin has served as a senator from Wisconsin since 2012, when she became the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. Two years after Trump's narrow win in her state, she won reelection by 11 points. When it comes to trying to unite the party after the Democratic primary, Senator Elizabeth Warren might be the best pick. She overlaps with Sanders on many policies and could help make sure those voters don't stay home or cross over to support Trump, as some did in 2016. At the same time, she's also a septuagenarian who will turn 71 in June, which isn't ideal as a back-up for Biden. As a liberal senator from Massachusetts and former Harvard University professor with demonstrated struggles over her past claims to Native American heritage, it's not difficult to see how she might be attacked in a campaign. If Biden wants a running mate who hails from one of the three key states that Trump carried narrowly in 2016 - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - the Michigan governor makes the most sense. She's also notably among Trump's most vocal critics during the coronavirus outbreak. Trump at one point said he told Vice-President Mike Pence not to call Whitmer because of her criticism. That's not to say she's doing this for any reason other than she's concerned about the federal response in her state, but this could be a key argument for the Biden campaign in the general election, and she's been out front on it. Senator Amy Klobuchar did Biden a favour by dropping out of the race ahead of Super Tuesday and helping him win her state. She also earned strong reviews for her debate performances, and she has the kind of mid-western appeal that could help in a state such as Michigan or Wisconsin. Her electoral history is pretty sterling. One drawback, though, she ran as a more pragmatic candidate in the primary and wouldn't necessarily appeal to liberals who feel strongly about issues such as Medicare-for-all. That said, her Senate record is unmistakably liberal. There's a reason Senator Kamala Harris, of California, tops many of these lists: she's perhaps the most logical choice. She's the only black woman serving as either a governor or senator right now. Her presidential campaign flamed out after an early surge, and given her background as a prosecutor, it is easy to see her playing the traditional VP role of attacking the opposition. At the same time, one person she attacked in rather personal terms during the primary was Biden, whose past position on busing she vehemently criticised, while comparing her own experience with the issue. The main criticism of her campaign was that it wasn't really about anything, or even busing, her position didn't wind up being much different than Biden's. Perhaps having her own message will be less of an issue, though, when she's running as part of a ticket. The Washington Post Copyright © 2020", Aaron Blake ,"April 9, 2020"

Replay   In a live-streamed address to supporters, Sanders said it was a ""difficult and painful"" decision to suspend his campaign, but that Biden's substantial delegate lead and the coronavirus pandemic had forced his hand. ""I wish I could give you better news but I think you know the truth and that is that we're now some 300 delegates behind vice-president Biden and the path to victory is virtually impossible,"" Sanders said on Wednesday (Thursday AEST). ""I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign I cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour."" He continued: ""If I believed we had a feasible path to the nomination, I would certainly continue the campaign. But it's just not there."" Sanders said he and his supporters had moved ideas recently considered ""radical and fringe"" - such as a universal healthcare system provided by the federal government - to the centre of US political debate. Sanders' withdrawal will pave the way for high-profile Democrats such as former president Barack Obama to endorse Biden, who staged a remarkable comeback after disastrous early performances in Iowa and New Hampshire.

""We do not believe any further progress can be made without the court's intervention,"" Rogers wrote in a status update filed on Tuesday, local time, that detailed what she felt was deliberate foot-dragging by the Epstein estate on creation of a victims' compensation fund and making witnesses available to local investigators. Rogers earlier this year brought a civil enforcement action against the Epstein estate, later adding and labelling as co-conspirators two longtime Epstein lawyers - Richard Kahn and Darren Indyke - who in his will updated shortly before his jail cell death by apparent suicide last August 10 were named executors of the estate. The attorney general also filed liens against Epstein estate assets, making it difficult for the estate to pay employees and bills and to sell assets that could ostensibly be used to compensate Epstein's victims. Jeffrey Epstein's home sits on the island of Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. It was one of many homes owned by the hedge fund manager.Credit:Miami Herald For the past month, the Epstein estate and the Attorney-General have been negotiating a deal to have the liens lifted in exchange for trade-offs. These included: the appointment of Marci Hamilton, a noted advocate for victims of child sex-abuse, to the administration of the compensation fund; the setting aside of $US50 million ($81 million) for victims who might opt out of the voluntary compensation fund to pursue separate litigation; and a pledge that no victim would have to release claims against a third party in exchange for receiving compensation. In documents filed in support of her motion, George included emails from lawyers for the estate that insist victims forfeit their right to sue others connected to the estate - including property managers, pilots, household servants, drivers and recruiters of underage girls - as a condition of receiving a piece of Epstein's fortune.

The estate appeared to be moving away from a demand that victims sign a confidentiality agreement as a prerequisite to receiving any funds. Among third parties alleged to have participated in sexual misconduct is Great Britain's Prince Andrew, whose ties with Epstein date to the 1990s. He has denied any inappropriate behaviour but was relieved of royal duties last November after a disastrous television interview in which he showed no empathy for the victims and offered no explanation for why he was photographed with a woman who said she was forced by Epstein to have sex with the prince three times.

A total of 17,127 people have died from the virus in Italy, the most anywhere in the world, with Lombardy accounting for 55 per cent of the tally. The region also accounts for 39 per cent of the country's 135,586 confirmed cases. A mural on the side of a building in Lombardy thanks medical workers.

However, a damning letter by senior doctors, including the heads of 11 provincial health authorities within Lombardy, said failures in the region's health system had exacerbated the greatest emergency Italy has faced since World War II. Amongst the failings they highlighted was a lack of protective clothing for medical staff - a regular source of anger since the outbreak emerged on February 21. The medics also bemoaned an ""absence of strategies"" in tackling the crisis, a lack of good data and limited testing as the virus spread. This ""greatly underestimated the number of patients and, to a lesser extent, the number of dead"", they wrote. While the neighbouring region of Veneto engaged in widespread testing in a known coronavirus hotspot, Lombardy only tested the seriously ill arriving for treatment in hospital, saying they did not have the capacity for wider checks.

The federation says 94 medics have died in the outbreak, many in Lombardy, which is run by the far-right League party. There was no immediate comment from Lombardy officials. Aged care homes The letter took aim at the management of nursing homes, where hundreds of people have died without ever being tested. The doctors said in the province of Bergamo alone, 600 of the 6000 pensioners under care had died. Italy's Health Ministry announced on Tuesday it was sending inspectors to Milan's largest nursing home, Pio Albergo Trivulzio, where more than 100 people have died since March. A photograph of nine bodies in the home's mortuary was published on the front page of La Repubblica newspaper on Tuesday, with another showing its chapel full of coffins. Replay   Lombardy's top health official, Giulio Gallera, rejected media allegations that the region had allowed hospitals to send infected patients to local care homes without proper protection in an effort to free up badly needed space in packed wards. ""We always acted for the good of everyone in an extraordinary emergency and we will not let anyone cast aspersions on the serious, rigorous work we have carried out,"" he said on Facebook. He did not refer to the doctors' letter. Italy's healthcare system is decentralised with regions having control over the money that goes to hospitals within their own borders. Lombardy has focused on developing a dual private-public network of high-performing hospitals, but critics say this was done at the expense of grassroots medical care. ""Public health and on-the-ground medicine have been neglected and weakened in our region for many years,"" the doctors said. ""It is going to be difficult to recover from this situation at the moment,"" they wrote, adding that as a starting point, the region should undertake large scale testing of health workers.

Tedros was elected with the strong support of China, one of five permanent veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council and which claims Taiwan as its own territory. He has firmly backed Beijing's claims to have been open and transparent about the outbreak, despite strong evidence that it suppressed early reports on infections, while echoing its criticisms of the US. At China's insistence, Taiwan has been barred from the UN and the WHO and even stripped of its observer status at the annual World Health Assembly. At the same time, it has one of the most robust public health systems in the world, and has won praise for its handling of the virus outbreak. Despite its close proximity to China and the frequency of travel between the sides, Taiwan has reported just 379 cases and five deaths. US and Taiwanese officials met online last month to discuss ways of increasing the island's participation in the world health system, sparking fury from Beijing, which opposes all official contacts between Washington and Taipei. Also at Wednesday's briefing, Tedros sought to rise above sharp criticism and threats of funding cuts from President Donald Trump over the WHO's response to the outbreak.

49,/world/middle-east/coronavirus-threat-presents-ceasefire-chance-for-five-year-yemen-war-20200409-p54ily.html,Coronavirus threat presents ceasefire chance for five-year Yemen war,"Dubai: The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis says it is halting military operations in the country in support of UN efforts to end a five-year war that has killed over 100,000 people and spread hunger and disease. The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by UN special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Medical staff set up a coronavirus quarantine ward at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen.Credit:AP The ceasefire will go into effect at midday on Thursday, Yemen time, for two weeks and is open to extension, he said in a statement. The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities. The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen. Yemeni Shiite Houthis protest against US President Donald Trump in Sanaa, Yemen, in January. Credit:AP ""[Our proposal] will lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces. Last week, UN envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen. Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace."" A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the US Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"". The UN and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities. Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Saudi Vice-Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $US500 million ($800 million) to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $US25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. The United Nations appealed for more than $US4 billion in 2019 for the humanitarian crisis and is expected to ask again for several billion dollars in 2020.

The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by UN special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Medical staff set up a coronavirus quarantine ward at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen.Credit:AP The ceasefire will go into effect at midday on Thursday, Yemen time, for two weeks and is open to extension, he said in a statement. The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities. The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen. Yemeni Shiite Houthis protest against US President Donald Trump in Sanaa, Yemen, in January. Credit:AP ""[Our proposal] will lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces. Last week, UN envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen. Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace."" A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the US Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"". The UN and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities. Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Saudi Vice-Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $US500 million ($800 million) to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $US25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. The United Nations appealed for more than $US4 billion in 2019 for the humanitarian crisis and is expected to ask again for several billion dollars in 2020.

A destroyed building in Luganville, Vanuatu.Credit:AAP Cyclone Harold ripped through Vanuatu and Fiji as a deadly top-strength storm this week, causing injuries and damage to property, and severing communications. Before that, it left 27 people missing and presumed dead in the Solomon Islands after they were swept off a ferry in rough seas. The storm is now headed toward Tonga and expected to land there on Thursday or Friday, emergency officials said. The cyclone forced Vanuatu, which has yet to report a case of the COVID-19 infection, to suspend social distancing rules intended to combat the virus, Red Cross officials said. The island state's leaders also are rethinking new border restrictions imposed to head off a virus outbreak, they said. “It’s an incredibly challenging time right across the globe, and it’s hard to imagine a worse time for a mega-storm like this to hit,” Luke Ebbs, Vanuatu director for charity Save the Children, said in a statement. Josephine Latu-Sanft, a Tongan-born communications director for The Commonwealth - whose members include more than 20 small island states - said the storm had thrown the islands' pandemic preparations into question, and left nations that have few resources struggling to deal with two crises at once. Fiji, for instance, has about 15 cases of COVID-19 and no deaths yet, but will find it hard to maintain a lockdown to tame the disease's spread while dealing with the storm's aftermath, she said. Replay   In many islands in the South Pacific, ""that’s where the worry is"", she added. ""If they have to lift that (lockdown) to put everybody in a church or evacuate a rural area, that's a problem."" Tonga has just ""a handful"" of intensive care beds for a population of 100,000, to treat both storm injuries and potential cases of the novel coronavirus, Latu-Sanft said. Many people also fear that visitors bringing in storm aid or other supplies from abroad could unwittingly introduce the virus in places where it has yet to take hold. For small islands, working to prevent a COVID-19 crisis ""doesn't mean all the other issues you're dealing with go away"", Latu-Sanft told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Patricia Scotland, secretary-general of The Commonwealth and a native of the Caribbean island of Dominica, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017, said lessons learnt in the South Pacific may soon have wider implications. Both the Atlantic hurricane season and South Asia monsoon, for example, begin in June, and could bring flooding and other threats even as countries are likely to be still grappling with COVID-19. ""If we're not careful we may have the perfect storm,"" Scotland warned in a telephone interview. Economic shutdowns associated with efforts to control the virus also will make it harder for many people to cope with potential climate-related disasters at the same time. Communities that rely on fishing, for instance, can no longer sell to restaurants or broader markets, and tourism is on hold as travel bans are put in place. ""If no one's flying and there's no tourism and no one is buying your fish, you're really looking at an economic disaster as well,"" Scotland said. Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said aid agencies and climate change experts have long been concerned about more countries and communities facing multiple crises - from health emergencies to conflict outbreaks or weather disasters - all at once. The current pandemic is now expanding that risk to many parts of the world beyond the poorest and most conflict-affected countries, he said. ""Are we going to see a lot more of this? Absolutely,"" he added. Reuters Copyright © 2020", Laurie Goering ,"April 9, 2020"

But that optimism is often mixed with a fatalism that nothing will really improve for the vast majority of people in one of South America's poorest countries. Once home to 3000 sugar workers, the abandoned Houston sugar estate has gradually been absorbed into the suburban sprawl of Georgetown. About 100 families still live in the uniform one-story cottages built by the state sugar company for workers in the 1960s. For them, the recent changes have brought opportunity. Like most of Houston's residents, Harisha's ancestors came to Guyana as indentured labourers from India in the late 19th century to replace enslaved Africans on the sugar plantations after the British, who then ruled Guyana as a colony, abolished the slave trade.

While the effects of the giant oil discoveries off Guyana's coast are most obvious in and around Georgetown, they are now beginning to extend a little further beyond the capital, too. In a brick shack on the edge of the jungle 25 kilometres away, Jason Bobb-Semple, 25, is making his own big bet on oil. With a $US3000 ($4800) government loan, he built a small poultry farm and bought 4000 chicks to meet what he expects to be a booming food demand in a rapidly developing country. ""After all this oil,"" Bobb-Semple said, people will want to eat. ""These are my hopes."" Jason Bobb-Semple’s wife, Rosalene, on their small poultry farm in Georgetown, Guyana, built with a government loan.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times Just hours after Bobb-Semple received the chicks, he got a visit from his first potential investor, a Guyanese emigre businessman who was back home looking for eggs to sell to the offshore oil rigs. The investor, Lancelot Myers, said oil companies currently have to import most of their provisions, providing a business opportunity to local entrepreneurs who can fill supply gaps. ""Now is the time to hit the ground running,"" he said. The enterprising energy of the Guyanese seeking to benefit from the oil boom contrasts sharply with the deep depression, both economic and psychological, reining in the rural sugar belt, which had powered this country's economy since the 17th century. A decision by President David Granger to shut down most of Guyana's unprofitable, state-owned cane processing plants in 2018 left about 7000 sugar workers unemployed, devastating the surrounding regions. The closures have turned places like Skeldon in the fertile east of the country into ghost towns, wiping out the once-vibrant local markets and businesses that used to serve the sugar workers. Bands of former cane cutters aimlessly roam Skeldon's streets or pass the time in fast-food shops without eating, despairing of finding another job. ""This country was created out of sugar. I lived my life in that industry,"" said Ferdinand Guptar, a 59-year-old unemployed cane cutter in Skeldon, who now does household chores for his wife while she cleans the floors at a school for $US200 a month. ""It's depressing when your wife has to take care of you,"" he said. The lay-offs inflamed ethnic tensions, with the mainly Indo-Guyanese sugar workers accusing Granger's predominantly black government of targeted economic repression. According to the latest census, ethnic Indians comprise 40 per cent of Guyana's population of about 750,000, compared with 30 per cent for the Afro-Guyanese. The indigenous communities, about 10 per cent of the population, provide the country's traditional swing vote. ""Sometimes it's not just about profitability, but the quality of people's lives,"" said David Armogan, governor of Skeldon's region, referring to his opposition to the sugar plant closures. ""This is more about vindictiveness than economics."" Workers wait for a storm to pass before continuing to repair a breached sea wall in Mahaicony, Guyana.Credit:Adriana Loureiro Fernandez/The New York Times These ethnic tensions reached a fever pitch during the March 2 elections, whose aftermath has descended into a bitter, inconclusive contest between Granger and the main opposition party backed primarily by ethnic Indians. The outcome remains undecided, and the country is still at a political standoff. The financial stakes of the political conflict are enormous, as oil revenues are expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars into government coffers in the years ahead. The election was largely a referendum on how Guyana should spend that windfall. The ruling party advocates using the money to retrain agricultural workers for the public and service sectors. The opposition instead wants to subsidise sugar farms to keep rural communities alive. The first small-scale oil exports started in January. While the money that the government will see in 2020 is just a fraction of what's coming when output reaches 1.2 million barrels day at the end of this decade, one-third of the state's budget this year still is expected to come from oil revenue. The International Monetary Fund projected that Guyana's tiny economy would grow by 86 per cent this year, the fastest rate in the world. That forecast, however, is likely to take a major hit from the sudden collapse of oil prices, the coronavirus pandemic and Guyana's ongoing political paralysis. To Guyana's small but vocal group of environmentalists, the country's polarised politics and ethnic grievances distract from its existential problems as it becomes a major contributor to fossil fuel consumption. Along the country's densely populated central coast, rising sea levels brought on by climate change are gradually overwhelming a system of dikes first built hundreds of years ago by the Dutch colonialists who preceded the British. Nine out of 10 people in Guyana live below or near sea level. Each day for the past five months, a road gang has toiled on a Sisyphean task along the muddy Atlantic Coast, trying to fill a breach in near 100km sea wall with stones and sand. Each week, the tide washes away their efforts. ""It keeps getting worse, until you can't control it,"" said Joree Shoturem, an ex-farmer in the village of Broom Hall near Georgetown whose rice fields were ruined by the creeping salt water and whose sheep and cows were swept away. ""The repairs have had no good result."" Despite the futility, Shoturem has resigned himself to his new government job. With no farm, he has joined the work crew, ceaselessly lobbing piles of dirt into an advancing ocean. ""People don't make the connection between the rising tides and the fossil fuel,"" said Annette Arjoon, a local businesswoman and environmentalist. ""Unless we have a real national conversation, we'll use the oil revenues to build higher sea walls."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Anatoly Kurmanaev ,"April 8, 2020"

To Guyana's small but vocal group of environmentalists, the country's polarised politics and ethnic grievances distract from its existential problems as it becomes a major contributor to fossil fuel consumption. Along the country's densely populated central coast, rising sea levels brought on by climate change are gradually overwhelming a system of dikes first built hundreds of years ago by the Dutch colonialists who preceded the British. Nine out of 10 people in Guyana live below or near sea level. Each day for the past five months, a road gang has toiled on a Sisyphean task along the muddy Atlantic Coast, trying to fill a breach in near 100km sea wall with stones and sand. Each week, the tide washes away their efforts. ""It keeps getting worse, until you can't control it,"" said Joree Shoturem, an ex-farmer in the village of Broom Hall near Georgetown whose rice fields were ruined by the creeping salt water and whose sheep and cows were swept away. ""The repairs have had no good result."" Despite the futility, Shoturem has resigned himself to his new government job. With no farm, he has joined the work crew, ceaselessly lobbing piles of dirt into an advancing ocean. ""People don't make the connection between the rising tides and the fossil fuel,"" said Annette Arjoon, a local businesswoman and environmentalist. ""Unless we have a real national conversation, we'll use the oil revenues to build higher sea walls."" The New York Times Copyright © 2020", Anatoly Kurmanaev ,"April 8, 2020"
57,/world/south-america/most-people-on-antarctica-cruise-ship-have-coronavirus-20200408-p54i1d.html,Most people on Antarctica cruise ship have coronavirus,"Montevideo: Nearly 60 per cent of 217 people - many from Australia - on board a cruise ship off the coast of Uruguay have tested positive for the coronavirus, the ship's operator says. ""There are currently no fevers on board and all are asymptomatic,"" said Aurora Expeditions, the Australian operator of the Greg Mortimer ship that is working to disembark the crew and passengers and arrange flights to their home countries. Many of the passengers on the Greg Mortimer cruise ship, pictured, are Australians. The Greg Mortimer departed March 15 on a voyage to Antarctica and South Georgia that was titled In Shackleton's Footsteps, a reference to the polar explorer who led British expeditions to the region and died there in 1922. Of 217 people tested on the vessel, 128 were positive for the virus that causes the COVID-2019 disease and 89 tested negative, Aurora Expeditions said. Another six people who were evacuated from the ship are in stable condition and being treated in Montevideo. Replay   The people on the ship are calm but they are eager to go home, said Marcelo Girard, a doctor at a Uruguayan medical facility where two people from the Greg Mortimer are being treated. Australian passengers, and possibly those from New Zealand, are likely to fly home on Thursday or Friday on an Airbus 340 that has been refitted - with people who have the virus and those who do not travelling in separate cabin areas, according to Aurora Expeditions. The cost per passenger is about $15,025 and the cruise ship operator has asked the Australian government for help with expenses. The plan would require the passengers to undergo a 14-day quarantine on arrival at a facility in Melbourne, the company said. US and European passengers who tested negative will hopefully be able to depart later in the week, following a second test and permission from the Uruguayan government, Aurora Expeditions said. Those who tested positive must wait until they test negative before flying home.
