If it breaches the agreement and is forced to give Chevron the compensation payment, it would be one of the largest payments ever levied against an Australian union but much smaller than the $22 million the company initially sought over the union's campaign to keep foreign crews off Chevron ships. The Maritime Union WA boss Chris Cain said in emails that his union had delayed a Chevron ship.Credit:Philip Gostelow The fine will hang over the union as it enters into negotiations with the company on a new enterprise agreement covering workers at its offshore facilities, which include multibillion-dollar gas fields. Federal Court judge Katrina Banks-Smith on Thursday ordered the union, which is one of the country's most strident, to pay the fine if any of its organisers or delegates have a hand in any unauthorised industrial action at any Chevron project, including its giant Gorgon gas field. The union will still be permitted to undertake industrial action where it is allowed under legislation. Justice Banks-Smith's decision, which put into effect a deal agreed between the union and company, ends an almost eight-year-long dispute that began when the union held up a ship called the RollDock Sun transporting freight to the Gorgon project for two days in June 2012. Chevron's Wheatstone project in Western Australia. The union was angry the vessel was crewed by foreign workers rather than local seafarers. In one email to other union members quoted in the court's judgment, the union's Western Australian secretary Chris Cain said it had ""been f---ing this vessel about for the last 2 days"" and went on to list ways the union would use safety measures to delay it further. The judge criticised the union for using safety as a tool of industrial conflict and issued an immediate penalty of $30,000, in addition to the $3 million potential compensation payment to Chevron. MUA National Secretary Paddy Crumlin said he welcomed the end of the saga. ""We accept the $30,000 fine, which allows us to finalise this issue and move on with developing a more constructive and functional relationship with the company under the existing industrial bargaining framework,"" Mr Crumlin said. The maritime union, which is part of the CFMMEU, is bargaining for a new enterprise agreement at Chevron in coalition with the Australian Workers Union. ""This collective agreement, which is supported by the overwhelming majority of Chevron's direct employees, provides an opportunity to deliver a good outcome for the company's business requirements along with the needs of their direct offshore employees,"" Mr Crumlin said.

Federal, state and territory leaders are still finalising what term two will look like across the country after the school holidays.

Education Minister Dan Tehan has directed private schools to be open. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The national cabinet meeting on Thursday discussed schools, focusing on a coherent approach after Easter holidays amid confusion among parents and teachers. Government sources said the leaders were working towards a more consistent national position on which children should be attending school, although no decisions have been made. While most private schools have been maintaining in-person supervision options for children of essential services workers in addition their rollout of distance learning, Mr Tehan has written to independent school peak bodies highlighting a ""small number"" that have closed their campuses entirely. ""While I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,"" Mr Tehan wrote. He said the students might be children of essential workers but added pupils should ""not be refused physical classroom access based on their parent's employment"". Under federal legislation, Mr Tehan has the authority to impose additional conditions on funding for private schools. He said he was using this power to include a condition starting from term two ""requiring schools to provide a physical classroom education environment for the children of parents who choose to access it"". Mr Tehan told reporters on Thursday he wanted schools to be open for safety reasons. ""We want them open so children can be safely cared for if their parents are working or if there are other reasons where children are much more safe at school rather than at home,"" he said. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week?

Bitter disputes have broken out across the sector as thousands of residents plan a rent strike and owners fear they will lose thousands of dollars in rent, with no government guarantees to ensure repayment when the economy comes out the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Sydney business owner Kyara Coakes outside the warehouse for her property-styling business. Credit:James Brickwood Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar has called for at least a 50 per cent waiver of all rent for businesses in financial distress, warning they will be saddled with debt if they come out of hibernation without some of their rent dismissed altogether. But landlords say they are being forced to act as guarantors for businesses and would have no way of recouping deferred rent payments if their tenants went bankrupt during the crisis. On Tuesday morning, a neighbour alerted property stylist Kyara Coakes her landlord was out the front of her Chatswood business. Her rent was three days late. She had asked for a pause in her $7000-a-month repayments as her revenue dropped 90 per cent when house inspection after house inspection was cancelled. ""There are only two ways of resolving the issues – full payment [or] terminate the contract,"" her landlord had responded in an email. ""I was just really shocked,"" Ms Coakes said. ""She came to the property, threatening me and saying she would change the locks that afternoon."" The national cabinet announced a moratorium on evictions a week earlier but the states have yet to legislate on the issue, which means landlords are still within their rights to take action of the kind in Ms Coakes' situation. Government leaders have urged landlords and tenants to ""work it out between themselves"". On Tuesday, a mandatory code of conduct was formalised meaning landlords would be forced to waive and defer lease repayments in proportion to the loss of income experienced by a business, but this has also yet to be legislated. Replay   Ms Coakes' landlord, hospital software supplier Amy Luo, said her threats to evict Ms Coakes were part of her negotiating tactics. Ms Luo, who also owns property upstairs, said she had not actually changed the locks on Ms Coakes' business. She said the coronavirus had placed owners, tenants and businesses in an invidious position. ""Our government effectively asks all the small or large landlords to become the untitled banks for financing all the failed businesses,"" Ms Luo said. ""It's going to be such a mess. I have a bank loan. I have employees I need to pay. My business is also suffering. I don't share her profit. Why should I share her loss?"" Ms Luo said she had given Ms Coakes four days to come up with an alternative plan. ""I cannot offer any reduction in rent right now until I am clear with the government arrangements,"" she said. Landlords can apply to their banks for mortgage relief if they are experiencing financial distress but this will need to be paid back over the life of the loan. The Grattan Insitute's budget policy director, Danielle Wood, on Thursday said the government's rental response was ""half-baked"" and would mean many businesses did not make it through the coronavirus hibernation period without further government rental support. ""The code ultimately falls short on scale, scope, and speed,"" she said. In the residential sector, both NSW and Victoria have committed to the principle of land tax discounts in exchange for rental reductions but have not released any firm policies on how this would be delivered, leaving landlords and tenants frustrated as negotiations break down. Real estate agent Kirk Stafford said the industry was ""being besieged by tenant activists who are advising their cohort to simply strike and refuse to pay rent"". Tenants Victoria said it was hearing daily stories of ""no tolerance for people who fall behind in the rent"" even if they had lost their jobs because of coronavirus.

The nation's four remaining refineries are under pressure as profit margins collapse along with global fuel demand. Since the virus outbreak, petrol demand has fallen 50 per cent and jet fuel demand 70 per cent worldwide as airlines ground flights and people are urged to stay home. Caltex has brought forward a temporary shutdown of its Lytton refinery for maintenance work as the coronavirus puts pressure on profit margins. Credit:Dan Peled. Fuel giant Caltex cited cashflow problems and margin pressure when it announced on Monday it would temporarily shut its Lytton refinery in Brisbane from May for extended maintenance work, while Viva Energy on Thursday said it was deciding whether to proceed with a $100 million investment to prolong the life of its Geelong refinery. Mr Taylor said the federal government was working with the major petroleum refiners ""to better understand their current challenges and to guarantee the security of Australia's liquid fuel"". He stressed Australia had a ""highly reliable fuel supply"" and the decisions about the two refineries would ""not hinder our immediate fuel security"". ""Australian motorists can be assured there is a good supply of fuel products in the market at lower prices. There is no need to panic buy,"" he said. The pressure facing refineries and the potential for disruption to international ports and shipping from coronavirus restrictions have prompted calls from Labor and the national motorists' peak body for the government to consider measures to secure local refining capacity. Australia imports around 90 per cent of its fuel. A report last year by the federal Energy Department found while Australia's four refineries were ""expected to remain viable in the foreseeable future"", their continued viability ""depends on the investment strategy of individual companies"". Global demand for refined fuel was expected to peak in the 2030s and it was ""unlikely that new oil refineries in Australia would ever be economical"", the report said. NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said it viewed disruption to domestic refining as a reason to reconsider government policy. ""We remain concerned that our refining capacity is falling in Australia; we don't want narrow margins to dictate when refineries are closed,"" he said. ""There's a great temptation to import refined product due to the economies of scale in Asian refineries and so on, but that has to be weighed up against the national interest. ""But I stress that to motorists today this means nothing. In fact, there are tankers backed up around the world due to oversupply."" Labor energy spokesman Mark Butler said fuel security was an ""extremely important issue"" for Australia and the government ""need to develop a clear plan that explains how Australia will safeguard and modernise its existing refining capacity, especially as refiners face the impacts of the current pandemic"".

""Australian motorists can be assured there is a good supply of fuel products in the market at lower prices. There is no need to panic buy,"" he said. The pressure facing refineries and the potential for disruption to international ports and shipping from coronavirus restrictions have prompted calls from Labor and the national motorists' peak body for the government to consider measures to secure local refining capacity. Australia imports around 90 per cent of its fuel. A report last year by the federal Energy Department found while Australia's four refineries were ""expected to remain viable in the foreseeable future"", their continued viability ""depends on the investment strategy of individual companies"". Global demand for refined fuel was expected to peak in the 2030s and it was ""unlikely that new oil refineries in Australia would ever be economical"", the report said. NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said it viewed disruption to domestic refining as a reason to reconsider government policy. ""We remain concerned that our refining capacity is falling in Australia; we don't want narrow margins to dictate when refineries are closed,"" he said. ""There's a great temptation to import refined product due to the economies of scale in Asian refineries and so on, but that has to be weighed up against the national interest. ""But I stress that to motorists today this means nothing. In fact, there are tankers backed up around the world due to oversupply."" Labor energy spokesman Mark Butler said fuel security was an ""extremely important issue"" for Australia and the government ""need to develop a clear plan that explains how Australia will safeguard and modernise its existing refining capacity, especially as refiners face the impacts of the current pandemic"".

We need a steady march to reform - and a broader tax base,"The 1987 federal election campaign was defined by the TV add featuring “whingeing Wendy”, a suburban housewife questioning John Howard from her kitchen, with devastating effect, about the financing of his promised $8 billion tax cut: Where’s the money coming from? Scott Morrison's challenge is to transform the economy, not to wait for it to snap back to its already weak position.
Credit: Jim Pavlidis Wendy listed an emotive range of possible “cuts” – home nursing, meals on wheels, pharmaceutical benefits, asthma and diabetes allowances, pensions, Medicare, child minding centres. The result was an historic third Labor win in a row, with an expanded margin of 24 seats (previously 16), despite a swing of 1 per cent against the government, and a small win by Howard in the popular vote. Howard’s case wasn’t helped when the finally released funding of his tax cuts didn’t add up, compounding the substance of Wendy’s question. While oppositions have always been bedevilled to provide funding detail, governments have struggled with the reality, to deliver responsible, conservative, fiscal management – Fraser undoing Whitlam’s profligacy, Hawke/Keating coming out of global recession and post-Fraser, Keating again after the early-90s recession, and Rudd/Gillard/Abbott/ Turnbull/ Morrison post-global financial crisis. Over the past five decades since 1970, the maximum budget deficit has been a little over 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 90s, and the biggest surplus was about 2 per cent in the early 2000s. The achievement of a budget surplus, a commitment to repay debt, and preservation of global credit rating have become increasing obsessions. Throughout, with the exceptions of the conspicuous periods of largesse under Whitlam and Howard, budgets have been mostly driven by varying degrees of austerity while seeking to avoid new taxes, although there has been a significant reliance on “bracket creep” in personal tax. On the brink of achieving the cherished budget surplus – of being “back in the black” – the impact of COVID-19, the Morrison government has launched fiscal measures worth almost $200 billion so far, about five times the Rudd packages in response to the GFC. Then there is almost a $100 billion liquidity injection from the RBA on top of a near-zero cash rate. Scott Morrison would have us believe all this is temporary, not structural, and that we can “bounce”,  indeed “snap”, back when the virus is under control. But snap back to what? And how quickly? We already had a weak and weakening economy, riddled with significant structural challenges, low business and consumer confidence, record household debt, flat wages, increasing job insecurity, low productivity and a majority struggling to meet a mounting cost of living? Not to mention neglect of the longer-term imperatives such as the transition to a low-carbon society over the next three decades? But what exactly will suddenly give households the confidence to spend, and businesses to invest? Or will government spending have to keep sustaining growth, and if so how will it be paid for? The prospective blowout of hundreds of billions in the budget deficit, and national debt, dwarfs anything since World War II. It will take decades to bring under control. This on top of what were already a host of unfunded commitments – Gonski and education, health, defence, the NDIS, infrastructure, and the legislated tax cuts. Former finance secretary Mike Keating had been predicting an inevitable increase in the overall tax burden of some 2 to 3 per cent of GDP in the 2020s. It will not be possible to stick with commitments to magic budget numbers. And we've learned just how long it will take to restore unemployment rates (likely to at least double) to near-full employment. Does Morrison imagine it will be easy to snap back from having increased the JobSeeker allowance or providing free childcare, or to avoid pressure to convert his JobKeeper payments into a universal living wage? Can he accept many businesses will still fail?  Howard found out just how tough it could be to take back what was given as a benefit, against the expectation that it had become a right. Lessons too from Tony Abbott’s attempt at extreme austerity, especially without effective consultation, that culminated in his failed 2014 budget. Morrison has no alternative but to shift gear into longer-term strategic planning, and to reassess national priorities right across government, industry and civil society, and in our global relations, especially with the US, China and our Asia-Pacific neighbours. This should lead to broad-based tax and reform of expenditure and the federation. More tinkering will be inadequate. Big trade-offs will need to be made, such as scrapping submarines and expensive and ill-considered defence procurement, in favour of important social programs. Infrastructure bonds could make an effective distinction between debt for recurrent spending and that for self-financing capital. We could eliminate or containing expensive and inequitable tax concessions. We should broaden the tax base and scrap profit as the basis of corporate tax. We need better tax arrangements between the federal and state governments and a re-allocation of spending and policy responsibilities. My fear is that the economic disruption and poor growth will last much longer than expected. Without a longer-term strategy, the government’s packages will only serve to compound our debt problems, leading to an ultimate debt crisis.

11,/politics/federal/government-shows-courage-with-130b-jobkeeper-package-20200408-p54iat.html,Government shows courage with $130b JobKeeper package,"The passage of the $130 billion JobKeeper package on Wednesday is a decisive step that should keep Australians in jobs and the economy poised for a resurgence after the coronavirus emergency. But this huge welfare program, which pays six million workers a wage subsidy worth $1500 a fortnight, sits uncomfortably with the Liberal Party’s core principles in support of free enterprise. The party has spent a decade attacking the Rudd government for creating a “debt and deficit disaster” by spending its way out of the global financial crisis. Some on the right still argue that it was not Kevin Rudd’s stimulus but other factors that saved Australia from recession in 2009. They argued that people would not spend the money sent to them because of fears of the taxes that would be needed to pay for them. But when he presented the package to a unique socially isolated one-day session of Parliament, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was “leaving ideology at the door”. He presumably meant he was putting aside the Liberal Party’s concerns about the effectiveness of government stimulus in boosting the economy. The question of whether the spending packages this time will be enough to save Australia from a sharp rise in unemployment and a deep recession will not be definitely answered for months until official data comes in. But the Herald  today published exclusive real-time private data which should reassure Mr Morrison that the first round of his stimulus announced three weeks ago is already working. It suggests that the $750 cheques, which reached about 6.5 million pensioners and welfare recipients last week, are having the desired effect of boosting consumer spending. Discretionary spending had fallen to 26 per cent below normal levels at the end of March as a result of the social distancing measures and the closures of restaurants, gyms and so on imposed to fight the spread of infection. But the real-time data shows that in the first week of this month, as the $5 billion worth of cheques started to hit bank accounts, discretionary spending rose and was only 16 per cent below normal. Significantly the big increases in spending were with retailers where pensioners and benefit recipients are most likely to shop. It also appears that some of the increase was spent on alcohol and gambling, which could have negative social effects. But being aware of the spending in real time will at least enable policy and decision makers to address the ramifications in a timely fashion. It is hard to know whether the JobKeeper program passed by Parliament will be as effective as a stimulus since it is targeted at a slightly higher-income group who, in theory, may save the cash rather than spend it. On the other hand, the flat rate of $1500 a fortnight is generous and could even be a pay rise for many low-wage and part-time workers who make less than that. A lot of family budgets will desperately need that cash and they will have confidence to spend knowing the subsidy guarantees their job for at least six months. The ALP Opposition has endorsed the JobKeeper package but it has complained that it excludes some categories of employers, such as local governments, and it questioned why some of the most vulnerable workers are excluded, especially one million casuals with less than 12 months in their current job, and foreign workers on temporary visas. Political ideology appears to be on ice for now and the Herald hopes it remains that way – at least for the duration of this crisis. The good news is that, for now, the government’s targeted efforts appear to be delivering much needed support for the economy. Since the Herald was first published in 1831, the editorial team has believed it important to express a considered view on the issues of the day for readers, always putting the public interest first. Elsewhere, we strive to cover a diversity of views without endorsing any of them. Copyright © 2020", ,"April 9, 2020"

In theory, an uncontrolled pandemic would have devastated Australia's hospital system, with 89 per cent of the population infected. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rightly argued these theories are not facts.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The Morrison government is too gentle to spell out the consequences but there are clear implications from the maths. Even in a more moderate scenario in the government modelling released on Tuesday, with quarantine and isolation measures in place, the infection would have spread to 67.5 per cent of the population. Assuming an infection fatality rate of 0.7 per cent, this would have led to 118,000 deaths. The most benign scenario in the modelling, with a combination of quarantine, isolation and social-distancing measures, would still produce an infection rate of 11.6 per cent. That might lead to 20,000 deaths. But this is not a model of actual policy today. Prime Minister Scott Morrison rightly argued these are theories, not facts. The biggest lesson from the modelling is how little we know. The government released an anodyne slide pack that looked backwards rather than applying actual numbers to forecast where we are going. That work is still to come. But there is no doubt combined government action has worked. Australia has flattened the curve. Even so, there is a warning for anyone who assumes they know exactly which measures work best. How much gain is there from school closures, for instance? Jodie McVernon, a professor at the University of Melbourne and one of the top epidemiologists advising the government, said so many measures had been applied so rapidly and concurrently that singling any of them out was extremely difficult. ""I could overlay any number of curves on a model and it would show that things do better and better together, but we actually don't know how well school closure works,"" she said. ""And the role of children as transmitters in this epidemic remains very uncertain."" There is more work to be done before Australians can know which measures need to stay in place and which ones might be eased.

Global demand for refined fuel was expected to peak in the 2030s and it was ""unlikely that new oil refineries in Australia would ever be economical"", the report said. NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said it viewed disruption to domestic refining as a reason to reconsider government policy. ""We remain concerned that our refining capacity is falling in Australia; we don't want narrow margins to dictate when refineries are closed,"" he said. ""There's a great temptation to import refined product due to the economies of scale in Asian refineries and so on, but that has to be weighed up against the national interest. ""But I stress that to motorists today this means nothing. In fact, there are tankers backed up around the world due to oversupply."" Labor energy spokesman Mark Butler said fuel security was an ""extremely important issue"" for Australia and the government ""need to develop a clear plan that explains how Australia will safeguard and modernise its existing refining capacity, especially as refiners face the impacts of the current pandemic"".

ACTU secretary Sally McManus said it was now employers' turn to ""step up"" and take advantage of JobKeeper rather than asking for further compromises on workers' pay and conditions, which unions had agreed to in three big bargains struck before the $130 billion wage subsidy plan was announced. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus says employers who breach the JobKeeper laws will face public campaigns from unions.Credit:AAP ""You're going to have to actually prove that you can't get the JobKeeper and also prove that you're suffering because... not all employers are,"" Ms McManus said. ""And just because there's a little bit of a downturn isn't justification for cutting hours and we won't be accepting any proposals to cut pay."" Ms McManus' comments came as the government announced it would freeze 242,000 public servants' wages for six months. ""While communities are doing it tough, it's important the Australian public service helps share the economic burden,"" said Ben Morton, Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The public sector union said the wage freeze would save a minute amount of money in the context of the overall budget and did not make sense when the government was trying to stimulate the economy. Employer groups, including in the real estate industry, have pushed for further changes to industrial awards to give businesses an even greater ability to reduce pay and working hours amid the downturn. Businesses that receive JobKeeper are already set to get broad powers to change employees' rosters, locations and duties where necessary. Ms McManus said that meant there was ""no need whatsoever for any other changes to the Fair Work Act"" in industries where most employers will qualify for JobKeeper. Any employer that disregards safeguards in the scheme, which include requirements employees can keep two weeks of holidays and are allowed to work less if their pay drops, will be confronted with naming and shaming and legal action, Ms McManus said. ""The trade union movement is going to be all over any employer who tries to profit from the pandemic,"" she said. A spokeswoman for the Fair Work Ombudsman's office said it was receiving more than 1000 calls a day from employers and employees asking for advice about their rights under coronavirus. Innes Willox, chief executive at the Australian Industry Group said some businesses would miss out on JobKeeper but still needed ""more flexibility to cope with the impacts of the crisis"". He pointed to a recent Fair Work Commission decision that encouraged unions and employers to continue to negotiate about changes to preserve businesses and jobs. One area where unions are still open to negotiation with businesses, Ms McManus said, was where very high turnover businesses took a significant hit to their earnings, but not enough to meet the 50 per cent revenue loss condition for JobKeeper. There, unions will negotiate company by company rather than across an industry. About 1 million casual workers and a similar number of migrant workers are ineligible for JobKeeper, but the eligibility criteria can be altered by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, which Ms McManus said would be a focus for the unions. Meanwhile, the Fair Work Commission said on Wednesday it would consider a push from unions representing frontline medical workers to give them paid pandemic leave, which could be used multiple times in the case of repeated exposures to the coronavirus. Ms McManus said the unions were still negotiating with employers and governments but the states ""understand very well the need for it"".

25,/politics/nsw/nsw-finalising-tenancy-relief-as-residential-rents-likely-to-drop-20200408-p54idb.html,NSW finalising tenancy relief as residential rents likely to drop,"The Berejiklian government's plans for residential rent relief will include deferring or even waiving land tax for landlords on the condition they pass on the savings to tenants. NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the states had been working on ideas for rent relief following this week's national cabinet meeting. NSW is finalising residential rent relief as tenants are hit by the financial impact of the coronavirus. Credit:Jim Rice “Offering a degree of land tax waiver or deferral for landlords is something we are finalising,"" Mr Perrottet said. But Mr Perrottet urged tenants to keep paying rent. The government is keen to ensure relief measures only apply to people whose finances have been hit by the coronavirus crisis. ""Obviously many people are worried about keeping a roof over their head, but I don't believe something like a rent strike will ultimately help either party,"" Mr Perrottet said. ""This is a complicated area and both sides face challenges, and I urge landlords and tenants to work together to find solutions at this extremely difficult time."" Rents are expected to drop in coming months, experts say, as a surge in rental properties combines with a drop in tenant demand due to the economic impact of COVID-19. The number of rentals hitting the Sydney market over the past three weeks was up 18 per cent year-on-year, according to Domain figures. A return of short-term holiday rentals to the longer-term market, a change in tenant circumstances and a drop off in migration are all behind the jump, according to Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell. ""The big question is if this is going to continue. If it does, we will see downward pressure on rents,"" Dr Powell said. Median Sydney asking rents rebounded over the first quarter — after reaching their lowest levels in years — according to the latest Domain Rent Report, but the turnaround could be over before it's truly begun. Median rents rose 1 per cent for houses to $530 a week, and 2 per cent for units to $520 a week, off the back of a fall in unit completions at a time of steady population growth, Dr Powell said. House rents are still $20 lower and unit rents $30 lower than the 2017-18 peak. ""Sydney house rents rose for the first time in three years and unit rents rose for the first time in two years ... [but] this trend is expected to be short-lived,"" Dr Powell said. Meanwhile, Sydney's vacancy rate rose 20 basis points in March to 2.7 per cent, after trending down since mid-2019. There were an estimated 14,528 vacant rentals at the end of the month – 845 more than the previous month, with some landlords already slashing rents by hundreds of dollars a week to attract tenants. Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty. While the federal government has put a moratorium on rental evictions for six months, it has left the provision of further rental assistance to states and territories. For now tenants are required to negotiate rent relief with their property manager or landlord – with mixed results. Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, expected vacancy rates to rise sharply over the short term and said asking rents were already starting to fall. ""At one stage Sydney was recording annual rent declines of 5 per cent, and then towards the end of last year rents started to stabilise; it's very possible we could see yet another 5 per cent decline but we don't know yet, we need to see the fallout first,"" he said. Mr Christopher said vacancy rates would also be impacted by the number of new homes being completed. While completions are on the decline, an expected pull back in buyer and tenant demand could lead to an oversupply of new homes. He added rental markets in Sydney and Melbourne, which take the lion's share of net migration from overseas, were likely to take the biggest hit. Maria Carlino, the national head of property management at The Agency, has seen the number of rental listings across the eastern seaboard jump about 30 per cent in recent weeks. At the same time, property inquiries from potential tenants have dropped about 35 per cent and days on market have increased. The increase in available rentals was giving tenants more choice and opportunity to negotiate, Ms Carlino said. Meanwhile, The Agency is also working through hundreds of requests for help, with tenants across 15 per cent of its Sydney portfolio seeking some form of rent relief. Ms Carlino said most landlords were understanding of tenants in genuine need of assistance, but many were awaiting further government announcements.

Investors with vacant properties will be competing for tenants, Dr Powell said, so landlords with good tenants whose ability to pay rent has been affected will not want to lose them because of what will hopefully be a short period of uncertainty. While the federal government has put a moratorium on rental evictions for six months, it has left the provision of further rental assistance to states and territories. For now tenants are required to negotiate rent relief with their property manager or landlord – with mixed results. Louis Christopher, managing director of SQM Research, expected vacancy rates to rise sharply over the short term and said asking rents were already starting to fall. ""At one stage Sydney was recording annual rent declines of 5 per cent, and then towards the end of last year rents started to stabilise; it's very possible we could see yet another 5 per cent decline but we don't know yet, we need to see the fallout first,"" he said. Mr Christopher said vacancy rates would also be impacted by the number of new homes being completed. While completions are on the decline, an expected pull back in buyer and tenant demand could lead to an oversupply of new homes. He added rental markets in Sydney and Melbourne, which take the lion's share of net migration from overseas, were likely to take the biggest hit. Maria Carlino, the national head of property management at The Agency, has seen the number of rental listings across the eastern seaboard jump about 30 per cent in recent weeks. At the same time, property inquiries from potential tenants have dropped about 35 per cent and days on market have increased. The increase in available rentals was giving tenants more choice and opportunity to negotiate, Ms Carlino said. Meanwhile, The Agency is also working through hundreds of requests for help, with tenants across 15 per cent of its Sydney portfolio seeking some form of rent relief. Ms Carlino said most landlords were understanding of tenants in genuine need of assistance, but many were awaiting further government announcements.

Sources with knowledge of official inquiries into the debacle revealed a conversation took place with the Port Authority of NSW employee and a Border Force officer in the hours before the ship was due to dock. The Ruby Princess cruise ship at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Circular Quay, Sydney.Credit:Kate Geraghty The officer expressed concern about passengers disembarking after being made aware that as many as 140 passengers aboard were in isolation due to health concerns. So serious were the concerns flagged, the harbourmaster offered to stop the ship at Bradley’s Head to prevent it docking at Sydney Harbour. According to the sources, the harbourmaster was told by the Border Force officer that they needed to check with a supervisor and 15 minutes later, the officer called back and said the ship could dock. The crucial development is understood to be a key part of a NSW Police criminal investigation examining the fiasco. There are as many as 650 passengers who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and there have been 15 deaths. The sources said authorities would almost certainly examine who the Border Force official spoke to and why the decision not to leave the ship at Bradley’s Head was made. Border Force confirmed the telephone conversation between its officer and a ports authority employee in the early hours of March 19. ""The ABF officer made internal enquiries and subsequently advised the NSW Port Authority that the vessel had been cleared by NSW Health,"" a statement from Border force said. ""The ABF did not seek to shape or influence any view or decision by the NSW Port Authority."" NSW's total confirmed cases of COVID-19 stands at 2734, an increase of 49 cases on the previous day. There are 227 people being treated by NSW Health, including 36 patients in intensive care and 22 on ventilators. Premier Gladys Berejiklian told her MPs in a recent party room meeting that Border Force had wrongly told NSW Health that the cruise ship was deemed ""low-risk"" before it docked on March 19. Almost 2700 passengers were allowed to disembark in the early hours of March 19, with four cases of coronavirus confirmed hours later. An MP who was in the party room said Ms Berejiklian ""made it very clear that we did not fail, we were not responsible"". ""She was very defiant. We were absolutely not to blame,"" the MP said. But her comments prompted the Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram to hit back. ""What broke down in this case was ... health officers, trained doctors or nurses didn't get on board the vessel, swab passengers and take their swabs for results,"" Mr Outram said on March 25. He said his officers were responsible for ensuring there was no contraband and ensuring everyone had visas. The Department of Agriculture had the biosecurity responsibility, Mr Outram said. Replay   NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller revealed on Sunday there would be a criminal investigation, led by homicide detectives, and a likely coronial inquiry. Mr Fuller said an investigation was critical to determine whether the operators of the ship, Carnival Australia, were ""transparent"" about ill passengers. He also singled out the Ports Authority as doing an ""exceptional job"" after phone logs between the the authority and Carnival Australia suggested the ship downplayed the risk of COVID-19. The logs show the Ports Authority had initially not allowed the ship to dock because of coronavirus fears but then overturned that decision after being led to believe that there was no virus threat. On Wednesday, 30 detectives from State Crime, Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics and Marine Area commands were seconded to the criminal investigation dubbed Strike Force Bast. Investigators will interview ""high-priority witnesses"" this week and are urging passengers with relevant information to contact Crime Stoppers.

Mr Moselmane tendered his resignation on Monday afternoon, less than a year after he was elected in a secret ballot of NSW upper house MPs in May 2019. NSW Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane has been heavily criticised for praising China's President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus crisis.Credit:James Alcock His resignation relates only to the role of assistant president, which will see him forgo $57,525 in additional salary and allowances per year. The position will remain vacant until a replacement is appointed when Parliament sits in September. Mr Moselmane remains a member of the NSW upper house and a member of the Labor Party. Mr Moselmane resigned from the role following a week of intense criticism over public comments he made over China's handling of the pandemic, which included extolling President Xi Jinping's ""unswerving leadership"". Labor leader Jodi McKay has described his comments as ""appalling"", and said he would ""never be in the shadow cabinet"" but ruled out expelling him from the party. “He’s going through a very difficult time right now and I’m not going to expel him from the Labor Party,” Ms McKay told 2GB radio last week. China has been widely criticised by academics and health experts for downplaying the extent of the outbreak in Wuhan, the original epicentre of the pandemic, and silencing whistleblowers such as doctor Li Wenliang, who later died from the disease. As revealed by the Herald, Mr Moselmane lauded President Xi in a post on his personal website, where he stated that a nation needed ""tough, unswerving leadership, focused on the mammoth task ahead"" in order to contain the virus' spread. ""For the People's Republic of China, President Xi stepped up and provided that leadership. He mustered the resources of the nation and together with the great people of China – fought it and contained it,"" Mr Moselmane wrote. In a separate opinion piece for the East China Normal University, published in February, Mr Moselmane praised the ""serious attention, timely and effective countermeasures"" taken by the Chinese authorities. He also claimed ""the obsolete scum of 'white Australia', in conjunction with ""some mainstream media"", were fuelling anti-Chinese sentiments. Footage also emerged this week of Mr Moselmane giving a speech at a restaurant in Sydney's Chinatown earlier this year, where he declared the ""Chinese government should be commended for the immediate action it took."" Federal Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton last week condemned Mr Moselmane's website remarks as Chinese government ""talking points"", while former Rudd government minister Stephen Conroy described Mr Moselmane as an ""absolute disgrace to the Labor Party"" and said it was ""astonishing he's still in Parliament"". Mr Moselmane previously courted controversy for a 2018 speech in which he declared: “The only way for China to reach its potential is for China to force a change to the rules and create a new world order.” He was in the spotlight again last year, after the Herald revealed his political staffer, John Zhang, had completed a propaganda training course in Beijing run by the Chinese Communist Party in 2013.

Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said the seven High Court judges who acquitted the cardinal on Tuesday had in effect ""expressed no confidence"" in the state's justice system, and that all the officials involved in convicting him owed the public an explanation. Cardinal George Pell arriving at the Seminary of the Good Shepherd in Sydney on Wednesday.Credit:AAP ""The High Court has stepped in to say Victoria's legal system's got a fundamental problem – they're getting it too wrong for too long, and the public has got to ask questions about how we can continue to have confidence in Victoria's legal system,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""Instead the Police Minister and the Premier say 'nothing to see here'. They think it's OK to sweep all this under the carpet – well, justice is too important to be swept under the carpet in this state."" Australia's seven most senior judges unanimously ruled that Cardinal Pell's convictions for historical child sex abuse be quashed, ruling there was a ""significant possibility"" that an innocent person had been convicted. Cardinal Pell, 78, spent more than 400 days in jail after a County Court jury found him guilty in 2018 on five charges related to allegations he sexually abused two choirboys in 1996 and 1997 at St Patrick's Cathedral in East Melbourne.

They think it's OK to sweep all this under the carpet – well, justice is too important to be swept under the carpet in this state."" Australia's seven most senior judges unanimously ruled that Cardinal Pell's convictions for historical child sex abuse be quashed, ruling there was a ""significant possibility"" that an innocent person had been convicted.

37,/politics/victoria/the-cough-that-crossed-the-globe-andrew-abercrombie-s-ill-fated-party-20200403-p54gp9.html,The cough that crossed the globe: Andrew Abercrombie's ill-fated party,"Someone coughed at a high-society party in the US resort of Aspen and wealthy Victorians from Toorak to the Mornington Peninsula were infected with COVID-19. Melbourne businessman and Liberal Party powerbroker Andrew Abercrombie hosted the two-hour cocktail party at his luxury chalet that unwittingly compounded a public health crisis. Abercrombie is best known for his vast wealth and abiding devotion to the Liberal Party, which has not always been reciprocated. The 63-year-old multimillionaire lost to Kelly O'Dwyer in the Higgins preselection contest in 2009, despite hosting a tribute dinner for Peter Costello at his Toorak mansion months earlier. Andrew Abercrombie. Illustration: John ShakespeareCredit:  His role as treasurer of the Victorian Liberal Party ended in acrimony in 2015 when former state director Damien Mantach was caught embezzling $1.55 million in campaign funds. Mantach was sentenced to five years in jail, while Abercrombie resigned from his post amid scathing criticism of his oversight of the party's coffers which prompted sweeping reforms by party president Michael Kroger. Undeterred, he continued to raise funds, including a $10,000-a-head “special dinner” for Prime Minister Scott Morrison last year. In 2016, just days after another fundraising event for the Turnbull government, Abercrombie's faux chateau on St Georges Road in Toorak was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewellery. Less than a week after the heist, thieves broke into another property owned by Abercrombie on Portsea's clifftop. The culprits were never apprehended and the jewels never found. Not one to court the media, Abercrombie is rarely named in the press, other than his annual mention in the BRW rich list, which recently estimated his fortune at $512 million. Andrew Abercrombie's faux chateau on St Georges Road, Toorak. Abercrombie and wife Shadda, who is often referred to as Sharon Leigh Abercrombie in company documents, also own a $6.9 million apartment overlooking Noosa's Laguna Bay and another historic Toorak mansion on St Georges Road known as Edzell House. A generous benefactor to La Trobe University and director of the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Abercrombie was also a strident defender of News Limited columnist Andrew Bolt in 2011, when he was found to have breached the Racial Discrimination Act during a Federal Court trial. Abercrombie was a lawyer for the entertainment industry in the 1980s, until at 30 he packed his bags to study for an MBA in Switzerland before working on Wall Street. Upon his return to Melbourne, he established a financial services business called Flexirent in 1990. A disappointed Abercrombie and wife Shadda after his failure to win preselection for Higgins in 2009. Credit:John Woudstra With a presence in Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, the company now known as Flexigroup enables customers to purchase items from white goods to groceries by paying for them in instalments. The service is essentially a digital version of the traditional ""layby"" sale, but with the customer receiving the goods immediately. Abercrombie was the company's chief executive until 2003 and it listed on the ASX in 2006. He became chairman in 2015 but has always retained a significant stake in the business - at times upwards of 25 per cent. Like most listed companies, Flexigroup's share price has been battered by the collapse of global financial markets following the outbreak of COVID-19. But the buy now, pay later sector has been particularly hard hit, amid fears that a sharp rise in unemployment could trigger a mass default. At the time Abercrombie was toasting his guests in Aspen on March 2, Flexigroup shares were trading at $1.65. But over the past month, the stock price has plummeted to about 70 cents, punching a significant hole in his fortune. Not much, other than bunker down to avoid the maelstrom. The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald revealed a week ago that several guests from the soiree at Abercrombie's apartment in the luxurious North of Nell chalet had refused to self-isolate. As almost a dozen guests returned positive results, one couple refused to be tested in Aspen, unable to resist the perfect skiing conditions. A picturesque street in the Colorado holiday town of Vail.Credit:Ruth Ritchie Another couple with symptoms fled to the neighbouring resort of Vail, where they stayed with a friend from Melbourne, who would also become infected. She returned to Australia on March 13 and, having no symptoms and following the health advice at the time, attended a 21st birthday party in Malvern on March 14 where six people would become infected. One of the people infected at the party would then board a plane to Sydney on March 16. Upon their return to Melbourne, another infected couple attended an event for parents at Geelong Grammar's Toorak campus on March 6 before heading down to Portsea, where they allegedly played golf and shopped in Sorrento. Abercrombie has complied with all government directives, according to his spokesman. “Mr Abercrombie is in good health and has been in self-isolation in Melbourne since returning home from Aspen,"" the spokesman said. ""He has twice tested negative for COVID-19 and yesterday [March 26] received a notice from VicHealth confirming his isolation period is over. He has not been to Portsea since leaving for overseas in mid-February,"" his spokesman said. His spokesman did not comment on the conduct of his guests in Aspen. The Prime Minister announced on March 15 that all travellers arriving in Australia would soon be compelled to self-isolate for 14 days and those who tested positive required approval from state health departments before they could be released from quarantine. Premiers in Victoria and NSW have ramped up enforcement action, including massive fines, in a rearguard bid to contain the spread of the pandemic. But how can ordinary folk be expected to follow a government decree when some of the nation's most affluent figures continue to play golf and go shopping? Feelings running high: a sign recently posted on the Mornington Peninsula. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt weighed into the debate this week, branding the behaviour a ""disgrace"". ""Some people think that the laws and, even more importantly, the notion of socially responsible behaviour does not apply to them,"" Hunt said on Tuesday. The infection clusters in Australia's most advantaged suburbs have shown that COVID-19 has no regard for privilege. Stonnington, which includes the wealthy suburbs of Toorak, Malvern and South Yarra, has 82 infections - the most of any Victorian municipality to this point. Boroondara comes second, with suburbs such as Hawthorn, Canterbury and Camberwell recording 52 positive tests. Mornington Peninsula, which includes Portsea and Sorrento, recorded the fourth-highest infection rate in Victoria with 49 cases. Replay   The issue has been incredibly divisive on the peninsula, where many well-heeled Melburnians, including several members of the Aspen crowd, have sought refuge. Permanent residents, many of them elderly people from working-class suburbs such as Rosebud and Rye, are incensed about the disproportionate rate of infection and the impact it will have on their already overburdened hospital. Visitors heading to Portsea are now confronted with a blunt message at a roundabout on Melbourne Road and Canterbury Jetty Road. ""COVID 19 ain't no holiday. Go home. Locals only.""

38,/politics/victoria/charity-pledge-on-hefty-mp-pay-increase-slammed-as-weasel-words-20200403-p54gyf.html,Charity pledge on hefty MP pay increase slammed as 'weasel words',"The opposition has called for an immediate freeze on pay increases for Victorian politicians after a wave of hefty salary boosts for MPs landed in the midst of a national economic crisis. Labor parliamentarians on Thursday pledged to donate their increases to coronavirus-related causes as the second part of an 11.8 per cent pay increase for the Premier, Opposition Leader and their frontbenchers took effect. The donation pledge did little to quell angry reactions from some unions and a prominent unemployment advocate, who branded the pay rise ""disgraceful"". Liberal frontbench MP Brad Battin said the donation pledges were “weasel words” and “unacceptable”. “We will support legislation coming through the Parliament to freeze the pays of members of Parliament,” Mr Battin said on Friday. “Daniel Andrews, make sure that ... we don’t get any gain out of this crisis.” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrew on Thursday announced the pay rise would be donated.Credit:AAP MPs' salaries - and pay rises - are set by an independent remuneration tribunal and can only be knocked back by passing legislation through Parliament. The Premier, Opposition Leader and ministers are expecting a 4.8 per cent raise from July, having received a 7 per cent boost in September last year. Backbenchers received 3.5 per cent pay rises in September. The government has not said where Labor MPs will donate their extra pay. “All government MPs will make donations to COVID-19-related causes equivalent to the uplift in their take-home pay from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021,” a government spokeswoman said. Mr Andrews is the highest-paid state leader in the country, and will see his salary jump up to $441,439 on July 1. Donating the Premier's 4.8 per cent raise will hand almost $19,000 to charity. When asked what the Opposition would do with their pay rises if the government did not agree to recalling Parliament, Mr Battin said: “Our only position is freeze the pays and stop members of Parliament getting a pay rise when the rest of Victoria is hurting.” Replay   Unemployment advocate Jeremy Poxon said the Australian Unemployed Workers' Union had been ""absolutely smashed"" with requests for assistance as the economic shutdown continues to cause job losses across the state. ""It's disgraceful that politicians continue to enjoy regular wage increases while for almost 26 years there was no increase to Newstart,"" he said. ""It is an extraordinary level of inequality that exists when elected officials continue to live in comfort while much of the population is left to starve. ""The disparity is enormous. It's wild to us that more people aren't outraged by it. ""I call for [Victorian government MPs] to give their pay increases to housing services. To make sure the food bank can cope and make sure other services like the Father Bob Foundation can keep delivering."" Lisa Darmanin, branch secretary of the Australian Services Union, wanted the state government to help ensure council workers can keep earning a wage - let alone get a raise. ""It's fine for the MPs to donate their pay rises, but we are much more concerned about workers in local government getting a wage, let alone a wage rise, particularly the casuals and the part-time workers across some councils who are facing standdowns. ""We want to see some leadership on that issue."" Lisa Fitzpatrick, state secretary of the Victorian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, said her union thinks ""the Premier is worth every cent"" of his pay rise and praised the government for improving nurse and midwife patient ratios. ""Strong leadership is rare … Premier Daniel Andrews has steered this state through the recent bushfire disaster and is now leading us through the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic."" The union's EBA expired on March 31, with negotiations for a new one ongoing. Victoria's police negotiated a pay rise of between 2 and 3 per cent in their EBA in December, while last month the paramedics' union agreed to a 2 per cent annual pay rise. The Australian Education Union is currently negotiating its early childhood sector EBA and is due to begin discussions on a new agreement for schools - which usually lasts three to four years - in August.

Queensland’s Year 12 students, who were set to sit a public exam this October and November, might have those exams delayed until December. Public high school exams could be pushed back to December.Credit:Craig Abraham All Australian education ministers meet on Tuesday to discuss the way forward for Year 12 students, whose final year of secondary school has been interrupted by coronavirus. Queensland joined the national ATAR scheme in 2020, after state authorities dropped the Overall Position (OP) system. Year 12s now have to sit a public exam during a three-week block from October 26 to November 17. These exams could be delayed until December, Mr Tehan said on Monday. Minister for Education Dan Tehan said there had already been discussions with Australian universities.Credit:Alex Ellinghausen All options were being discussed so there was no interruption to the students as they strove to enter university and TAFE courses, the minister said. “Instead of [exams] normally being in November, push them back into December. These will be all the things that we’ll be looking at and working through tomorrow,” he said. One option would involve Year 12 students completing short courses at university before they began their formal first-year studies. “All universities have the ability to put short courses in place, which will enable students to catch up in areas where they mightn’t have been able to get that knowledge that they will require for a course like medicine, for example,” Mr Tehan said. “So, we’ve got the ability to look at all these things, be flexible, be innovative, and just say to students, ‘Look, you might be required to do this eight-week short course at the start of your medicine degree, so that you get that knowledge’.” Mr Tehan said there had already been discussions with Australian universities. “They’d be happy to look at a mix of what’s happened during the student’s assessments in Year 11, and then look at what’s happened in Year 12, and look at a mixture then of both,” he said. Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace said state's curriculum advice body, the Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority, on March 26 removed one assessment piece from each subject in Year 12. Principals were advised of the reduction in assignments in late March. “This means that final subject results in general subjects will be calculated from two internal assessments and one external assessment,” QCAA chair Brian Short said. “In Essential English and Essential Mathematics, it will be two internal assessments and a common internal assessment developed by the QCAA. “In all other Applied subjects, it will be three internal assessments.” Ms Grace said schools were making decisions to minimise the disadvantage for 2020’s students studying to attain a Queensland Certificate of Education. “The QCAA has removed one internal assessment from the total of four prescribed in each syllabus to provide some relief for students during this time,” Ms Grace said. “More than 98 per cent of schools have already uploaded completed internal assessments, meaning that for most students they will only be required to complete one further internal assessment this year,” she said. “We will continue to work collaboratively to adapt our learning resources as this unprecedented pandemic evolves.” Year12 students still have to complete the public examination, which is worth 50 per cent of their curriculum testing for maths and science. It makes up 25 per cent of the grade in other subjects.   Tony Moore is a senior reporter at the Brisbane Times Copyright © 2020", Tony Moore ,"April 6, 2020"

A political fight over the reappointment of Corruption and Crime Commissioner John McKechnie has exploded ahead of Parliament resuming next week.Credit:Nathan Hondros Mr McGowan wrote to Ms Harvey on Tuesday referring to the CCC's investigation into former Liberal MP Phil Edman. ""The interim report released on 17 December 2019 was critical of expenditure by Mr Edman in respect of social activities of a group which exists within the Parliamentary Liberal Party and particularly the Legislative Council, known as the 'Black Hand Gang' (a name associated with secret criminal groups, and which has no doubt been adopted in jest),"" Mr McGowan wrote. ""However, no member of the public should be able to suggest that the reason why Commissioner McKechnie QC does not have bipartisan support is due to this investigation."" Ms Harvey shot back with an angry email accusing Mr McGowan's request she involve herself in the decisions of the committee as ""not possible and highly improper"". ""Your approach demeans the position of Premier and you should try to temper your urge to play politics at a time when West Australians are under stress and losing their jobs,"" she wrote. ""I am surprised in a time of a COVID-19 crisis you have decided to once again engage in playing politics with this issue. ""I suggest, given your concerns over the decision of the Joint Standing Committee (JSC), you write to the JSC and outline your concerns as you should have in the first place."" On Thursday, Mr McGowan said he would consider changing the law to force Mr McKechnie's reappointment. This would remove the requirement for bipartisan support for a corruption commissioner's appointment, putting the decision in the hands of the government of the day. ""I was perplexed and frankly pretty outraged about this that they would deny the appointment of a corruption buster,"" the Premier said. ""We can seek to change the law and we may do that, but I prefer not to. ""I'd just prefer the Liberal party supports Mr McKechnie's reappointment."" Mr McKechnie's term as CCC commissioner is due to expire at the end of April and his relationship with Parliament and the upper house in particular has been tense amid a legal stoush over documents which may be privileged. In August 2019, Mr McKechnie threatened to quit his post if Parliament attempted to hold him in contempt after a parliamentary inquiry into the government's handling of his attempts to summon documents belonging to the Legislative Council. Mr McKechnie's reappointment is governed by a process set out in CCC legislation which requires the Premier to consult with the oversight committee. ""I was surprised by the reply from the JSCCCC indicating that bipartisan support and majority support for Commissioner McKechnie's nomination could not be achieved,"" Mr McGowan said in his letter to Ms Harvey. He said operational activities of the CCC could be interrupted if Mr McKecknie's reappointment was delayed.

A political fight over the reappointment of Corruption and Crime Commissioner John McKechnie has exploded ahead of Parliament resuming next week.Credit:Nathan Hondros Mr McGowan wrote to Ms Harvey on Tuesday referring to the CCC's investigation into former Liberal MP Phil Edman. ""The interim report released on 17 December 2019 was critical of expenditure by Mr Edman in respect of social activities of a group which exists within the Parliamentary Liberal Party and particularly the Legislative Council, known as the 'Black Hand Gang' (a name associated with secret criminal groups, and which has no doubt been adopted in jest),"" Mr McGowan wrote. ""However, no member of the public should be able to suggest that the reason why Commissioner McKechnie QC does not have bipartisan support is due to this investigation."" Ms Harvey shot back with an angry email accusing Mr McGowan's request she involve herself in the decisions of the committee as ""not possible and highly improper"". ""Your approach demeans the position of Premier and you should try to temper your urge to play politics at a time when West Australians are under stress and losing their jobs,"" she wrote. ""I am surprised in a time of a COVID-19 crisis you have decided to once again engage in playing politics with this issue. ""I suggest, given your concerns over the decision of the Joint Standing Committee (JSC), you write to the JSC and outline your concerns as you should have in the first place."" On Thursday, Mr McGowan said he would consider changing the law to force Mr McKechnie's reappointment. This would remove the requirement for bipartisan support for a corruption commissioner's appointment, putting the decision in the hands of the government of the day. ""I was perplexed and frankly pretty outraged about this that they would deny the appointment of a corruption buster,"" the Premier said. ""We can seek to change the law and we may do that, but I prefer not to. ""I'd just prefer the Liberal party supports Mr McKechnie's reappointment."" Mr McKechnie's term as CCC commissioner is due to expire at the end of April and his relationship with Parliament and the upper house in particular has been tense amid a legal stoush over documents which may be privileged. In August 2019, Mr McKechnie threatened to quit his post if Parliament attempted to hold him in contempt after a parliamentary inquiry into the government's handling of his attempts to summon documents belonging to the Legislative Council. Mr McKechnie's reappointment is governed by a process set out in CCC legislation which requires the Premier to consult with the oversight committee. ""I was surprised by the reply from the JSCCCC indicating that bipartisan support and majority support for Commissioner McKechnie's nomination could not be achieved,"" Mr McGowan said in his letter to Ms Harvey. He said operational activities of the CCC could be interrupted if Mr McKecknie's reappointment was delayed. ""These are substantial activities, and a change or absence of [the] commissioner would create significant disruption to these operational activities, and the important investigations to which they relate,"" Mr McGowan wrote. ""The current state of emergency and future recovery period is not the time to be changing leaders of the state's premier integrity agency.""

Dr Pettitt, who has one of the highest public profiles of any Green in WA, won a preselection contest against former upper house MP Lynn McLaren, who lost her seat in the region at the last election. Fremantle Mayor Brad Pettitt will stand for the Greens at the 2021 state election.Credit:Facebook In a press release, a spokesperson said the party had conducted a ""robust democratic process where grassroots members have been balloted to select our candidates"". ""During these difficult times the Greens (WA) remain committed to engaging with the community and grassroots campaigns driven by people not corporate donors,"" they said. ""It's now more important than ever that we hold this government to account and we are an adaptive party up to the challenge of campaigning in these uncertain times. ""It's clear the major parties are more interested in selling our state off to gas giants than taking the action we need on the climate crisis."" Dr Pettitt was a university lecturer in sustainable development and attracted national headlines in 2017 when the City moved away from celebrating Australia Day on January 26. He will be the party's lead candidate in the South Metropolitan region. In the South West, sitting MP Diane Evers saw off a challenge from environmental campaigner and WA Forests Alliance director Jess Beckerling. Greens leader Alison Xamon and East Metropolitan MP Tim Clifford were renominated without challenge. Mr Pettitt has been mayor of Fremantle since 2009 and his current term expires in October, 2021. The state election will be held in March, 2021. The Greens hope their campaign at the next election will be bolstered with the elevation of Perth expatriate and Melbourne MP Adam Bandt to the party's federal leadership. Long-serving Greens MP Robin Chapple has also signalled his intention to retire at the next election.

The call came as Treasurer Ben Wyatt said the part of the state economy which relied on household consumption had ""effectively stalled"" in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Liza Harvey has called for the state government to roll our low interest loans for small businesses.Credit:Marta Pascual Juanola Ms Harvey said small businesses would face a cash flow crisis over the next six months until consumer behaviour started to return to normal. ""We should follow what Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania have done and provide some low interest loans to small businesses to help them with cash flow for the next six months,"" she said. ""A lot of small business owners I'm talking to are saying if we could just get some cash flow to help pay the wages and tick things along until things return to normal, it'll be the difference between us closing our doors forever or being here in six months."" The opposition is also pushing for the government to provide more financial support for seniors, increase hardship payments and grant a payroll tax holiday for small businesses. Replay   On Monday Premier Mark McGowan announced a freeze on increases to household fees and charges, a doubling of the energy assistance payment for low income earners, the fast-tracking of payroll tax cuts by six months, and the deferral of payroll tax payments for businesses impacted by coronavirus. Talking to Gareth Parker on 6PR's Mornings, Mr Wyatt said the public reaction to the crisis would cause a contraction in the 40 per cent of the economy driven by consumer spending. ""What we're seeing, the data is still emerging, but that household consumption component of our economy, that's 40 per cent of our economy, that has except really for grocery chains, I suspect we'll see that as effectively stalled,"" he said. ""To give you some point of comparison, while household consumption is 40 per cent of the economy, government expenditure is about 14 or 15 per cent. ""So you can see we're in a scenario where the big engine room of our economy has been hit quite dramatically."" The Treasurer said there was no doubt businesses and jobs would be impacted. ""My view is that this June quarter and the September quarter are likely to see the biggest impacts and hopefully once we're through that September quarter we start to see, if you like, a normalisation of behaviour again,"" he said. ""At the moment, we're very much in that assistance and response stage, but we also need to start preparing ourselves for the recovery stage as well. ""I don't want to find ourselves on the other side of this with no balance sheet capacity to also then have a recovery package as well."" The real estate industry called on the state government this morning to consider rent assistance for residential tenants who lose their jobs and safeguards for landlords if tenants can't pay their rent because of the coronavirus pandemic. REIWA president Damian Collins said: ""At the end of the day, if the owner cannot afford their mortgage, the tenant will end up homeless regardless, so all participants need to be considered in any package or changes"".
