3,/national/year-12-kindy-should-get-priority-when-school-goes-back-teachers-federation-20200409-p54inb.html,"Year 12, kindy should get priority when school goes back: teachers' federation","The NSW Teachers Federation has suggested a staged return to school once health authorities and governments start lifting social distancing restrictions, beginning with year 12 and kindergarten. As schools prepare to deliver term two online, federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said leaders needed to think about how to ensure an ""orderly return"" when circumstances changed, avoiding a deluge of students when older or vulnerable teachers were unable to return. The NSW Teachers Federation says year 12 and kindy should be given priority when schools reopen. ""An option could be a staggered return to our schools,"" he said. ""I've advanced a proposition that part of an orderly [process], we could consider a return of year 12 and kindergarten, followed by year seven and year six, and progressively pad that out."" Educators cautiously welcomed the idea, although they said the process would be complicated and schools would need to be consulted. It comes as Education Minister Dan Tehan said ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week?"" he said. ""Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students - would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell said the government will be using the school holiday period to consider its options for term two and beyond. “We will communicate this with school communities before school returns. All options will be considered in line with health advice,” she said. While pandemic experts say children are not believed to drive the spread of COVID-19, teachers have been concerned about their safety, particularly those who are older or have underlying conditions. A 2017 workforce survey found the average age of NSW teachers is 37, but up to a fifth are over 50. Before they began holidays on Thursday afternoon, NSW schools were not closed but were delivering remote learning to everyone, and parents were encouraged to keep their children at home. About 94 per cent of families did so. By this week, two thirds of the public school teaching workforce were working from home. Schools have prepared to deliver term two lessons online. But as parents feel the stress of supervising students while working, or students become more restless about learning alone, some predict the number of students attending schools will rise. Craig Petersen, head of the Secondary Principals Council, said the danger of allowing students to return whenever their parents chose could lead to a situation in which there were more students at school than teachers available. An ordered return - prioritising high-needs years as suggested by the federation - made sense, but it would be complicated, he said. Year 12 teachers, for example, might have an underlying health condition, while some schools ran a ""compressed curriculum"" in which years 10 and 11 also did HSC subjects. ""This needs to be carefully thought through,"" Mr Petersen said. ""It introduces a whole range of complexities. What we need is for the principals' associations, for the federation, and for educators to be consulted."" Replay   Mr Petersen said parents were already ringing schools, confused about what to expect next term. ""We have to have clarity around this, schools cannot be left in this position where we become the target of parental concern and anxiety about decision we have no control over,"" he said. ""We are extremely frustrated with the lack of consultation and consideration for what's in the best interests of our students."" Jenny Allum, the principal of SCEGGS Darlinghurst, said schools had proven their ability to respond to changing circumstances over the past month. She said a staged return was ""certainly a possibility"", especially one involving year 12 as a priority. ""You can have 24 [year 12] kids working in three classrooms with one teacher, you can't have a class of 24 kindergarten kids in three classrooms with one teacher,"" she said.  ""But we are conscious that it's a significant demand on parents, to be supervising younger kids at home and trying to do their own work.""

Sign up to The Sydney Morning Herald's newsletter here and The Age's here. Professor Julie Leask at the University of Sydney's Faculty of Medicine and Health called on the government to explain its criteria for returning students to schools. ""The fact that [the federation is] thinking about this, and making suggestions, shows good leadership,"" she said. ""If we are all aware of what those benchmarks are, then [the government] can take the public along with them."" Mr Tehan has compelled private schools to open in term two for children who need supervision during the crisis rather than close their campuses entirely, issuing a binding legal directive tied to their funding.

4,/business/markets/oil-u-turn-trump-doing-something-no-president-has-tried-in-decades-20200409-p54ifw.html,Oil U-turn: Trump doing something no president has tried in decades,"Donald Trump is trying to do something no US president has dared to do in decades: Drive up the price of oil. For more than three decades, US presidents proclaimed cheap fuel as an almost God-given right for American motorists and homeowners, shaping the country's foreign policy in pursuit of lower prices. As president, Trump didn't just back cheap crude, he was its biggest supporter, frequently attacking OPEC and celebrating the shale boom's deliverance of ""energy dominance."" President Trump has done a remarkable u-turn on oil. .Credit:AP Now, the Russia-Saudi price war and a killer pandemic have caused prices to plunge, putting Trump in the awkward position of begging those same countries to turn off the taps, even though retail gasoline will become more expensive as well. The U-turn comes as America has gone from being the top importer of oil to the top producer, aligning its interests more closely with Saudi Arabia and Russia in a shift that holds the potential to reverberate through foreign policy for years to come. ""It used to be very clear. For decades, when the US was the largest importer, low oil prices were a real benefit to the country,"" said Dan Yergin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit. ""But now, it's very different. It's become such an important industry again, with the supply chains that go all across the country."" The new direction could change both how the US engages with its Middle East allies when prices rise and how the market itself is perceived. Just as many Wall Street traders have assumed that the Federal Reserve will save the day since the 1987 Black Monday crash, oil traders may now expect the same from the White House. Trump administration officials have said they are prepared to support OPEC and its allies agreeing to restrain output to lift oil prices. For now, Trump hasn't said whether he would try to rein in US production or limit crude exports. But he has threatened to put tariffs on foreign crude to protect energy workers and domestic oil companies if the Saudis and Russians don't agree to output cuts. ""I never thought I'd be saying that maybe we have to have an oil increase, because we do,"" Trump said in late March. ""The price is so low."" Trump will likely aim for an oil-price sweet spot, said Kevin Book, managing director of research firm ClearView Energy Partners. It needs to be high enough to sustain a domestic industry tied to about 10.9 million jobs, including 1.1 million directly connected with production, drilling and support activities. At the same time, it needs to be low enough to provide cheap energy to help prompt an economic rebound after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Even as the US claimed the title of the world's top oil producer, the country has remained at the mercy of Saudis who have a geological advantage over America and can extract crude at much lower prices. And now the oil that made America energy dominant is so costly to extract that almost 40% of US producers face insolvency within the year if prices remain near $30 per barrel, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City warned on Tuesday. Trump isn't the first president to criticise OPEC for prices being too low. The last time the US so publicly begged the alliance to scale down output was April 1986, when Ronald Reagan was spooked by plummeting prices hurting oil producers in Alaska and Texas. He dispatched then-Vice President George H.W. Bush to Saudi Arabia. Oil prices have plummeted in 2020. Credit:AP In comments similar to Trump's today, Bush told the late King Fahd that the US is interested in ""cheap energy,"" according to contemporaneous press reports. Yet he also cast cheap crude as a double-edged sword for America, stressing that ""a viable domestic oil industry is in the national security interests of the United States,"" recalled Bob McNally, founder of oil consultant Rapidan Energy Group, in his book Crude Volatility. Bush's mission was not an immediate success. Although Bush and King Fahd agreed the world needed stable oil prices, they did not agree on how to achieve them. And Saudi oil production continued to rise for at least four more months. OPEC countries ultimately agreed to cut output and abide by quotas by December 1986, eight months after Bush's visit. Now Trump is in a similar position, as he exhorts Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman to slash production by at least 10 million barrels a day, despite having blasted OPEC in the past as a ""monopoly"" that is ""robbing our country blind"" and having long celebrated low gasoline prices as a ""tax cut"" on American consumers. ""It's a remarkable change,"" said Jason Bordoff, a White House energy adviser during the Obama administration. ""The American political consciousness has been shaped by half-a-century of worry about high prices and foreign oil."" Not everyone, though, is happy with Trump's shift. ""We've seen every president declare that we are energy independent and then we find ourselves pleading with the Saudis and Russians,"" said Robbie Diamond, head of Securing America's Future Energy, a group that argues for a greater variety of transportation fuels and more transparent oil markets. ""If we were energy dominant,"" he said, ""we would not be grovelling to these countries to cut production."" Bloomberg Copyright © 2020"," Jennifer A. Dlouhy , Javier Blas ","April 9, 2020"

Most people infected in the viral pandemic now sweeping the globe will come down with only a mild case of the mystery illness. Some won’t know they’ve had it at all. But when it's bad, it can mount an attack on the whole body – and start a storm in the lungs. How it plays out depends on the two factors important to any invasion: the strength of your defences and the strength (or dose) of what you’ve been hit with. Connor Reed, 25, knows well the racking cough and spiking fever of the illness now called COVID-19. He says he came down with it late last year in the centre of the initial outbreak, Wuhan in China. He still lives just a 20-minute walk from the wet market where it's believed the strain jumped from wild animals into humans.  At first, Reed seemed to just have a cold. A week on, then early December, he was already feeling better when a fever hit, and a cough. His whole body started to ache. Another week went by. He thought he was on the mend until the cough became deeper, seeming to settle at the bottom of his lungs. ""It was hard to breathe,"" Reed says. ""Even walking to the bathroom, I felt like I was running out of air. My ears hurt from it, I lost my balance at times. It started to get scary, like the worst flu I've ever had."" Reed ended up in hospital and, after a full day of testing, he says doctors told him he had a ""new kind of pneumonia"". Fortunately, he was fit and healthy: his life didn't appear to be in danger. Steroid inhalers helped reduce inflammation in his lungs and, more than a month after that first sniffle, Reed recovered. When he called the hospital in early January to ask more about his test results, they told him what was about to hit headlines around the world in just a matter of days – a new kind of coronavirus had been identified in humans. Reed was one of the earliest suspected cases. Four months on, what do we now know about COVID-19 and how the body reacts? What is treatment like? And how long does recovery take? Connor Reed, 25, in Wuhan, China. Having recovered from one of the earliest suspected cases of the coronavirus COVID-19, he is hoping to return to Brisbane, Australia.Credit:Facebook You can’t see the virus with the naked eye – it’s nanometres wide. But when someone is infected, they can shed it, shooting viral particles at least a metre into the air in water droplets from their nose and mouth, usually through coughing or sneezing. Viruses infect a new host by harnessing our own cellular machinery to replicate. To get in, they need the key – a receptor within a cell they can bind to. Which cell a virus latches onto largely determines where it will spread throughout the body – and helps guide treatment. The four main coronaviruses found in humans tend to colonise only the nose and throat. Collectively, they cause about one in four cases of the common cold and symptoms are mild: a runny nose, a sore throat, sometimes a cough or a fever. But since 2003, three dangerous coronavirus illnesses have emerged in humans: SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also spawned global panic when it exploded onto the scene 20 years ago, the more deadly but less common MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and now the latest, COVID-19, which has already infected about 1.5 million people and killed about 87,000. All three attack the lungs as well as the sinuses, sometimes developing into viral pneumonia – and, because they're new, there's little natural immunity to fight them off. COVID-19 is about 75 per cent similar to the SARS strain, and even thought to bind to the same cell receptors (ACE2), which are largely found in the lungs. Early studies suggest this virus might be better at hacking into that receptor than SARS, which is why it's more infectious, says Professor Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. A spokesman for the Australian Department of Health offered a different theory: the new virus appears to be replicating fastest in the nose and throat, rather than the lungs. That could make it more transmissible but also perhaps less fatal than the other two coronavirus outbreaks. To find the virus, doctors need to catch it in the act, either by swabbing a sample directly from the nose and throat or in lung phlegm or by singling out the body’s immune response to the infection in a blood test. The new strain has already been found in the lungs, nose, throat, even in faeces, says infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre. It can hitch a ride in the bloodstream to other organs such as the kidneys, liver, intestines and possibly the heart, brain and central nervous system, too. But both methods of testing can return false negatives - a throat or nasal swab can miss the virus (because it's actually replicating lower down in the lungs) and a blood test, which is not yet widely available outside of China, can be performed too early - some people will take up to 9 days to produce antibodies to fight off a virus. Professor Lewin adds, ""Early on, you had doctors in China diagnosing just off chest scans because you can see that lung inflammation, even if it's not severe."" Now, Sydney scientists have developed a fast training tool to help frontline healthcare workers spot COVID-19 in lung scans. Still, infectious disease physician and microbiologist Professor Peter Collignon says it’s not yet clear if everyone gets the new virus in their lungs. “Finding it down there isn't a tipping point [for severity] by any means. Some children have it in their lungs but display no symptoms,"" he says. ""But it might not have travelled all the way down from the upper respiratory area in every case."" Much of what we know about COVID-19 comes from studies of the first 55,000-odd cases in China, which found more than 80 per cent of people could fight off the illness without serious complications, even if they developed pneumonia. Lungs cleared, coughs eased and fevers broke. Anecdotally, some people have likened the infection to ""three weeks in hell"", racked by chills and struggling to breathe, while others have reported only a sore throat, a small cough, even no symptoms at all. Hollywood actor Tom Hanks offered an early public glimpse into life as a COVID-19 patient on March 11 when he revealed he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had both tested positive while in Australia shooting his latest film From hospital isolation on the Gold Coast, Hanks wrote of the illness's onset: ""We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too."" More public figures from actor Idris Elba to Prime Minister Boris Johnson have since been diagnosed. ""I've developed mild symptoms,"" Johnson said from isolation at home on March 27. ""That is to say, a fever and a persistent cough."" When his fever remained high more than 10 days later, he was moved to hospital, and is now in intensive care, though he remains stable. Based on data collected in China, most patients seem to have: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat, and nausea or diarrhoea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS. Less than five per cent of cases so far involve a blocked nose. With early symptoms deceptively similar to the common cold or flu, one sign of infection may be a loss of smell (and an accompanying reduction in taste), as the virus attacks that part of the respiratory system. Sometimes people infected with the virus who otherwise feel fine will find they cannot smell as usual - though experts say the effects are not permanent and the sudden loss of the sense is far from a ""test"" for the virus. (Not all patients report losing smell and the symptom is also associated with other common colds and viruses). In the case of COVID-19, Professor Collignon says patients generally appear to have mild symptoms for the first week or so. In severe cases, they can intensify into pneumonia during the second and, in rarer cases, the infection will turn unexpectedly deadly.  At the World Health Organisation, assistant director-general Bruce Aylward warns when danger strikes, it's often fast-moving. Doctors report patients can go downhill quickly during those ""critical"" second and third weeks and urge people with or suspected to have the virus to monitor their symptoms, particularly their breathing and fever. Infectious diseases physician Sanjaya Senanayake says he's seen patients develop ""bad shortness of breath"" around the second week of symptoms. ""Then if they're going to get very sick, about two and a half days later, they [usually] start to develop fluid in their lungs."" CT scans from a 77-year-old man with COVID-19 in China over 10 days, showing ground-glass opacity of the lungs and lesions. 
The man died 10 days after the final scan.Credit:The Lancet medical journal  On scans, they call it ground glass – a white mist over the usual empty black of the lungs. In some cases, there are bright spots, eerily similar to the “honeycomb-shaped” lesions left by SARS, but mostly COVID-19 makes a finer and more-even pattern across both lungs. This inflammation is a sign the body is fighting back against the virus – in that battle, the lungs are ground zero. But Professor Collignon warns sometimes the collateral damage can be worse than the bug itself. As the immune system ramps up its defences, blood vessels start to leak and the lungs can be flooded with cellular debris, making it harder for them to pump oxygen to the rest of the body – and harder for patients to draw breath. ""They start to drown,"" Professor Collignon says. Falling blood oxygen levels put pressure on other organs, in particular the heart. More systems can start to fail, and blood pressure too, which, if it falls low enough can tip the body into septic shock, a whole-body infection. ""Even if the virus spreads to the heart or the kidneys and damages them, the real cause of death is still probably going to be oxygen levels falling and setting everything else off,"" Professor Collignon says. ""If you're an older person or already unwell and those organs are weaker, it can be the straw that breaks the camel's back."" While there is a theory that people with already compromised immune systems might escape this effect and so cope with an infection better than expected, Professor Collignon warns they are especially vulnerable to the other big killer – co-infection. Usually being hit with two bugs at once is rare, though not impossible. But as the virus chews through cells, it leaves the lungs less able to filter out germs picked up from the nose and throat – and wide open to a case of the flu or even a bout of bacterial pneumonia. (The first man to die from COVID-19 in Thailand was also sick with dengue fever.) During the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, most victims died not from the original virus but due to these second-wave bacterial pneumonia infections. Fortunately medicine has advanced a lot since then, making such complications much easier to treat. So far, the WHO reports about 20 per cent of cases become severe, requiring medical intervention for serious breathing difficulties and falling blood oxygen levels. Of those, 6 per cent have been pushed into critical care – as multiple organs begin to fail alongside the lungs or septic shock sets in. About 3.4 per cent have died. But experts expect the real death rate is actually much lower, given so many mild cases will likely go undiagnosed. While anyone can catch the virus, older people and those with other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are most at risk of fatal complications. (""Over the age of 50, the immune system starts to fall apart,"" Professor MacIntyre explains). But in Italy, where the virus has gained a particularly deadly foothold, doctors warn that younger patients (in their 30s, 40s and 50s) were also presenting to overwhelmed emergency departments needing help to breathe. Some have even raised the prospect of an age limit for intensive care to free up beds for younger cases as life-saving machines such as ventilators become worth their weight in gold. Data since complied from elsewhere in Europe and North America also reflects a concerning number of hospitalisations among people under 55, prompting warnings for younger adults to take COVID-19 more seriously. As of April 6, 448 of Australia's then 5795 cases were in hospital, 96 of them in intensive care. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said many of those people were young - in their 30s. ""This is not just an old person's disease,"" he said. ""Those young people don't have [other] risk factors."" While so far those who have died in Australia have been over 50, people in their 20s have seen the highest number of coronavirus infections of any age bracket. So far internationally very few children have been diagnosed or suffered serious cases globally – a phenomenon also observed during SARS. Still, they are not immune and some have died from the illness, including the heart-breaking case of a six-week old baby in the US. Smokers are considered more at risk, as early studies show the same cell receptors the virus hijacks in the lungs increase with cigarette smoke. But pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers so far do not appear in any heightened danger, as they were during the last pandemic, the 2009 swine flu. Still they should take precautions as they are known to be more susceptible to other common respiratory viruses. Whatever your personal vulnerability, the dose of virus you first receive – say, from touching a contaminated door knob versus caring for an infected person over several days – also plays a big part in how your body copes. ""The higher the dose the faster you will get sick, and the harder it will be on you,"" Professor MacIntyre says. That could explain why otherwise young and healthy medical workers have died from the disease. Li Wenliang, the 34-year-old doctor who blew the whistle on early cases of COVID-19, went through a gamut of treatments after falling ill himself, including antivirals, antibiotics, even having his blood pumped through an artificial lung, but he died weeks later. As with SARS, clusters of severe infection are emerging in hospitals and households as people come into sustained close contact. Despite the breakneck speed of global research, a vaccine for COVID-19 is still many months away. And, while antivirals and therapies that block diseases such as malaria, Ebola and HIV are being trialled against the new disease in some parts of the world, including Australia, treatment is largely about managing complications – providing oxygen, keeping up fluids and monitoring how the body is coping. Antibiotics don't work on the virus as it is not caused by bacteria but they can be deployed against secondary infections. If breathing starts to fall, respirators and other measures will kick in to keep the lungs going. As Professor Lewin explains, doctors have a key choice when treating any new virus: is it better to block it directly with antiviral therapies as in the case of HIV or should they also dampen down the body's immune response using drugs such as Interferon, to minimise the fall-out damage? ""Sometimes that can help but sometimes it means the infection overwhelms,"" Professor Lewin says. ""It didn't work with SARS but there's been some success with MERS. Already for this, there's been candidate [therapies] that look good in test tubes, but we need trials. China has about 70 going, testing different [approaches] but they're actually struggling to enrol people now as cases fall."" No vaccine exists for either SARS or MERS - the former died out within about nine months so an inoculation never hit the market while the less common MERS has struggled to attract research funding since it emerged in 2012. After the big Ebola outbreak of 2014, a global group formed to speed up research into vaccines and MERS was recently identified as a priority. ""Then this new one hit,"" Professor Lewin says. Professor Collignon thinks it unlikely any of the potential treatments now being tested against COVID-19 will save the day before a vaccine hits the market – without larger trials, he warns, small studies can miss big problems on roll-out. Experts also warn of increased pressure on hospitals  if severe coronavirus cases hit wards all at once. While Australia's healthcare system is strong compared to other countries, it's population is also older, Professor MacIntyre notes, meaning more demand for intensive care. To slow down the virus and avoid a ""pinch"" around flu season, Australia has followed other countries in rolling out stricter containment measures such as quarantining suspected cases, shutting down gatherings and ordering people to stay home except for essential reasons. So far it appears to be working - a surge in new infections in mid-March has now begun to flatten. Most people with COVID-19 present to hospital because they're having trouble breathing, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. Once admitted and getting oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but others will need ventilators or other machines to keep their lungs and organs working. Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a breathing machine known as a ventilator, whether they know it or not. But Dr Suzi Nou at the Australian Society of Anaesthetists says that while a patient having routine surgery will need a ventilator for minutes or hours – perhaps a few days in intensive care – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. Australia is already doubling the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to 4000 - some are being freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery. But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou. It's those doctors and nurses who will need help to keep coming to work in the weeks and months ahead, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Retired healthcare workers as well as medical students are now being drafted into the fight. Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” Replay   Professor MacIntyre says it's too early to say if this disease will result in any permanent damage for severe cases– such as the lung tissue scarring seen in some SARS and MERS patients. But a full recovery typically takes about 10 days to a month. Symptoms tend to clear up within a fortnight in mild cases or six weeks for more serious, Associate Professor Senanayake says.  Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. So far, more than 300,000 people have already recovered worldwide. With these virus-fighting antibodies in their system, many experts expect they will remain immune for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Recovering from a virus usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. For COVID-19, there have already been cases of people cleared of the virus, only to test positive again days later or, in the case of one woman, more than a month down the line. But while experts say it's possible to be re-infected again, it's more likely the virus was still in their system. Some studies have even suggested it can lie dormant in other parts of the body for weeks - with the longest period of infectiousness recorded as 37 days so far. ""But in some cases, when people are returning persistently positive tests after getting better, they might be finding dead virus,"" Associate Professor Senanayake says. Amid a shortage of testing kits world-wide, Australia is only retesting frontline staff in health and aged care to confirm their recovery. That means official recovery data remains patchy. Most patients are instead told to wait 72 hours after symptoms disappear (provided they have already isolated for 10 days from illness onset). A federal government spokesman also said a patient who keeps testing positive after symptoms vanish is not necessarily still infectious. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve,"" he said. Back in Wuhan, Reed was cleared to leave his own home quarantine months ago but, like tens of millions of people in China, he'd spent the first three months of 2020 under lockdown in an unprecedented government effort to stem the virus's spread. On April 8, the streets finally opened again - residents waved flags and sang songs as they left their homes for the first time in 11 weeks. While the local government did not appear to pick up early cases of the virus, Reed says China took the right step, however extreme, in shutting down parts of the country - the government's data says new infections have all but stopped within its borders, even as new frontiers of the virus rage in the US and Europe. ""In Italy, it seems to be a similar thing to Wuhan,"" Reed says. ""The virus was there, but people didn't notice, it was brewing quietly for a while, and then it suddenly exploded. Now they've followed China with lockdowns. Australians need to take this seriously."" Reed was born in the UK but is now hoping to return to Brisbane, where he grew up and his family still live.

6,/national/since-you-asked-your-covid-19-questions-answered-20200323-p54cy7.html,Can you catch the virus from the air? Should we wear masks? Your COVID-19 questions answered,"Since it emerged in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million people and claimed 80,000 lives. To stop a pandemic that spreads from person to person in close quarters, the world has largely shut down, with borders closed, streets empty and whole cities going into quarantine. Australia has its own strict measures to avoid the terrible scenes playing out in places such as Italy and the United States, where hospital systems are now being overwhelmed. We are told to live our lives further apart – literally – by avoiding gatherings, staying home and keeping 1.5 metres clear of each other.  As we learn more about this virus, questions from you, our readers, are flooding in. Our explainer team, as well as our health, science and data reporters, will answer as many of them as we can. And when new information comes to light, we'll bring you updates too – with the latest featured up top in this story. Here's what we know so far. While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk may have been underestimated. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet (which are classed as anything more than five microns in size). They can leave the body as both. It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s, they only travel a metre. But we know more now.   “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. Professor Morawska, who heads up the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology,  is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for potential aerosol transmission. On April 9, the Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading frequently in the air, even if it's possible. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would be likely look different - more infectious and striking down more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results – some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska notes, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. The warmer the conditions, the faster they tend to break up. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours but the WHO has since pointed out that it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus generally aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO itself has issued warnings to healthcare workers that this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 operate as if the infection is airborne, including in Australia.  ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Face masks can protect against the droplets that spread the virus and are now a common sight on the streets of many cities around the world such as Hong Kong. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put healthcare workers at risk. All the same, calls are growing in many Western countries for a wider take-up of face masks to slow outbreaks. In the US, the CDC has already reversed its own advice, now urging people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Professor Morawska agrees with the move, saying masks aren't needed outdoors but are a good idea where ventilation is poor. But Professor MacIntyre and Associate Professor Senanayake say they are not as necessary in Australia as in places such as New York, where community transmission is now rampant. It’s also unclear how much home-made masks or bandannas and scarves will block virus-laden droplets. Some experts warn widespread use of DIY masks could leave people with a false sense of security - and an urge to touch (and so possibly contaminate) their face more often as they adjust them. Australian health authorities have indicated they are reviewing their own advice on masks, as they do all their guidelines, but stress it still stands. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has urged people not to ""waste"" masks and notes they should be handled carefully and changed regularly (Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty recommends sterilising used masks rather than throwing them away, given the shortage).   Right now, health authorities say anyone who spends more than two hours in an enclosed room with an infected person has been exposed to the virus. But Professor Morawska warns there needs to be more focus on the need to opt for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. Associate Professor Senanayake says air conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the Department of Health agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low outside healthcare settings. NSW Health said air conditioners and heating were safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and if possible, use a different bathroom...to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets...and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne."" Yes. Some people will be infected without symptoms or very mild symptoms. To test for COVID-19 right now, clinicians need to either take a direct sample of the virus, from a throat or nose swab or in lung phlegm, and examine its genetic code. Those tests are considered very accurate but in some cases if they miss the virus – say, because it is further down in the lungs and someone doesn’t cough up any phlegm (or sputum) – they can return a false negative. That’s why tests are often repeated, especially for patients recovering and returning to the community. Blood tests, which look for the body’s immune response to the infection, can also be used but are not yet widely available outside China, and bring their own false negative risks – antibodies deployed by the body to fight off the virus can take more than a week to form so may not show up if the test is performed too early into the illness. This is also true of the rapid finger-prick tests being checked in Australia right now by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after problems overseas. A government spokesman said these are therefore not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA sample or PCR test and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. Scientists aren’t sure yet but they think it most likely. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with those aforementioned antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Many experts say reports of people appearing to catch this new virus twice are probably best explained by false negative tests clearing them of the infection too early (when the virus had actually remained in their system) rather than catching it a second time. Associate Professor Senanayake says the virus collected by the later tests may even be dead. Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. Countries that have ""flattened their curve"" and dramatically slowed outbreaks have carried out exhaustive testing and contact tracing. In many cases, people without symptoms are tested and health officials actively hunt for others, checking temperatures on entry to buildings. Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries (more than 300,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still fairly strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. Amid increasing calls from the WHO to ""test all suspected cases"", Australia has since ramped up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expanded that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also started in areas identified as at risk of community transmission, such as Sydney. Some states are taking matters into their own hands. On April 6, the ACT began random sample testing of those with symptoms but no other risk factors as did Queensland in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast. That followed news that Victoria would expand testing to people aged over 65, Indigenous Australians, cruise-ship passengers, people in high-risk settings such as prisons, schools, childcare and homelessness and disability support as well as police and firefighters. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says he supports more widespread testing but stresses there is still a ""temporary"" shortage of testing kits. Faster finger prick tests that tell if someone has antibodies against the virus (and so has it or has fought it off) in their blood are also being checked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. But a government spokesman said these are not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA test because such antibodies can take between five and seven days of infection to develop and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. The spokesman did not give a timeline of Australia's work to fix the testing-kit shortage but said it was ""working with public and private laboratories and with pathology suppliers to understand both international and domestic supply capacity and capability and are exploring the possibility of building further domestic capability to produce tests and reagents for COVID-19"". They also did not answer questions on how kits are being distributed to the states, as some push ahead with their own expanded testing. Australia has one of the lowest positive rates for testing in the world, Professor Murphy says, meaning authorities feel ""reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of cases in Australia and that means we can get on top of cases"" through contact tracing. That's in contrast to countries such as Iran, Italy and even the US, where Australian authorities say they likely only tested the more severe cases or, as Murphy puts it, ""when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in community that were undetected"". Still, at times Australian authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, hundreds of whom later tested positive. But the states have also threatened hefty fines and even jail time for those at risk of spreading the virus who break home quarantine orders. Anyone following the international news on the pandemic will have noticed a marked variation in death rates from Covid-19 among different countries. In hard-hit Italy, for instance, the death rate among confirmed cases is around 12 per cent in the first week of April, compared with 1.75 per cent in Germany and – thus far – less than 1 per cent here. East Asian countries have generally done better, the UK, Spain and the US worse. A number of factors help account for this variation. The most significant is that the death rate will largely reflect how widely you are testing, and the age groups you test in. If, as in Germany, you test a very large number of people, many of whom are young with mild symptoms, you get a lower rate of death overall. If, as in the UK and US, you only test those who are very ill and in hospital, the converse applies: your death rate looks much higher. Per head of population, Australia’s testing regime has been ahead of many other countries. Other factors that contribute to varying death rates include: demographics such as the age profile of a country’s population overall; density of living conditions; patterns of interaction between different generations; cultural factors (such as the absence of social kissing and handshaking in Japan); and, importantly, the capacity of health systems to cope with the very ill. Germany has more than double Italy’s number of acute care beds per 100,000 people, and more than triple the UK’s acute bed capacity. In Italy, with one of the oldest populations in Europe, researchers believe that deeply ingrained habits of adult children living with, or remaining housed close to, their parents has contributed to the high fatality rate there. Younger adults, commuting into larger employment centres where the virus had been silently spreading, bring the virus back to the smaller communities where their parents live. Smoking rates may be a factor in some places. The jury is out on whether seasonality (whether a country is going into warmer or cooler weather) plays a role. – Deborah Snow No matter where you live, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised that there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Here's the boiled-down version texted to thousands of Australians: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care."" Whenever you go out you must stick with just those in your household or up to one other external person, and you should keep your distance from others (about two steps or 1.5 metres). Wash or sanitise your hands regularly and ditch the handshake and the kiss hello. In enforcing these rules, authorities are emphasising a ""common sense"" approach. As NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says: ""If you're questioning whether you should be doing something, best to give it a miss."" We put a list of your questions to governments and are including the answers below, as we get them, and in more detail in this dedicated explainer here. On April 3, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""Doesn't matter what temperature it is, if it's a warm day, don't go in masses down to the beach."" The key word here is masses. No state has outlawed a trip to the beach (or the park) but they are urging people to reconsider whether the visit is necessary and warn new rules against gatherings may be enforced. Queensland police have closed some beaches, discouraged people from travelling long distances to them. Victoria also advises people to ""keep visits short and maintain physical distancing at all times"". A walk or a quick swim is ok, sunbaking probably not.  You can still hop in the car on your way to exercise but all states advise limiting travel. In Victoria, a government spokeswoman said on April 1, you should only drive in cars with people you live with, but advice since released says you can still use taxis and other ride-share services for ""permitted purposes"". WA advises sitting in the back if getting a taxi or an Uber and Tasmania also encourages people to extend physical distancing to car travel. ""Travelling in cars is not restricted ... non-essential travel is,"" a Tasmanian government spokeswoman said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio people should not be going anywhere just for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out of the car. ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Not all states answered questions on whether learner drivers could still go out for driving practice but in Victoria, learner driving lessons should only be part of essential travel, such as to the supermarket.But NSW Police have ruled that learner driver lessons can continue – for an instructor it could be considered work that cannot be done from home and for the learner it is ""akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Family members can also take learners out for a lesson or for other essential travel. See more here. It depends on the circumstances – and again on what state you live in. The question of romantic partners who don't cohabit initially caused particular consternation when NSW and Victoria both ruled out social visits under their new emergency powers. You can still visit someone's house to care for them, drop off supplies or in an emergency – say, if you are fleeing danger, but in Victoria Police Minister Lisa Neville said on March 31 ""you cannot visit your partner for social reasons"". On the morning of April 1, a Victorian health department spokeswoman added: ""You shouldn't be physically intimate with people you're not living with, even if they are your partner."" But, later in the day, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton announced the rules around romantic partners – which by then had become known as the ""bonk ban"" – would be relaxed with a new exemption for couples. In NSW, Police Commissioner Mick Fuller made a similar exemption, saying you can still visit your partner as it falls under the category of ""care"". ""Mental health, we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you"". Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as Tasmania and the ACT still let you have up to two visitors over to your home at one time as long as you are following social distancing measures – no hugging or kissing, and allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In Queensland,you can have two visitors to each household - but no strangers are allowed over. In all states, tradesman, cleaners, even removalists are allowed if you really need them or may fall under caring but physical distancing must be maintained. – with Lydia Lynch While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear, although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. Victoria has since clarified its own rules to allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. But older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia’s chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  - with Noel Towell Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"" as new data shows tough new social distancing measures are slowing down the virus' spread in Australia. All states have issued similiar advice, warning a migration to the coast could spread the virus further and put dangerous strain on regional health resources. But not all are fining people for ducking down to the holiday house. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said police don't have the resources to enforce the advice over the upcoming Easter weekend but stressed ""this is not a holiday weekend, we can't have a normal Easter"" and state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says if you've booked a holiday you should cancel it. Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them as a household. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for supplies; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. Camping or setting up a caravan somewhere is out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental either. Airbnb now have cancellation policies in place to get a full refund if you booked before March 14. NSW says people shouldn't go on holidays or use Airbnb unless it's for an essential reason such as work and police have revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. See more here.  In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, “Easter holidays are cancelled this year”. Queensland police have flagged they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. - with Stuart Layt, Tammy Mills, Michael Evans, Hannah Barry, Michael Fowler If you have to. You can even have removalists provided you adhere to physical distancing rules. The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow its infection rate by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing As the world waits for a vaccine, this will save lives by helping stop a surge of cases overwhelming emergency departments all at once. Along with measures such as lockdowns and tracing and isolating cases, social distancing has worked against outbreaks in the past, including the Spanish Flu of 1918. The recent surge in Australian cases has started to slow a little in recent days as new rules come into force. But if people do not follow them, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns that Australia could lose its window to contain the outbreak – and cases could rapidly explode. . The federal government has stopped tracking recovery numbers in Australia, drawing criticism from some experts who say it is an important measure of any outbreak. Amid a shortage of testing kits, an Australian government spokesman confirmed only healthcare and aged care workers returning to the frontline must be ""cleared"" with testing (two negative tests) under the national guidelines. Local health authorities keep a close eye on all confirmed cases on the virus and others may still be retested. But most, such as those recovering in home isolation, only have to meet the following conditions: The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention advises the same 72-hour window of time after symptoms disappear but some studies overseas have shown the virus can live in the body for weeks after. The Australian government spokesman said ""a small proportion of people may have an illness that has completely resolved but their [tests] remain persistently positive"". There a decision on release from isolation will be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting their doctor, the testing lab and the public health unit. The 72-hour rule was decided by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which advises Health Minister Greg Hunt, as ""a precautionary period to manage uncertainty around how long a confirmed case remains infectious post-symptom resolution"", the spokesman said. ""Even in these patients there is uncertainty around whether there is a direct correlation of persistent [positive tests] and infectivity, but what we know from other virus infection, it is not a neat correlation,"" he said. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve."" Wash your hands after holding your cup. ""It's all about interrupting the chance of self-inoculation,"" says Associate Professor Ian Mackay, an expert on coronaviruses, at the University of Queensland. The virus has been found to last for shorter periods on card and paper than some other surfaces but it can persist, according to lab studies. ""Whether there is ever likely to be enough virus on that surface to infect another person remains an unanswered question,"" says Professor Mackay. ""The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus.""    Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science – people may be diagnosed or succumb to the illness further down the line. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the WHO estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV, which also caused global panic when it exploded onto the scene in late 2002, and MERS-CoV, which causes a condition more deadly again known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). On the raw figures so far, more than 1.4 million people have been infected worldwide and at least 81,000 have died. About 298,000 have already ""officially"" recovered. The case of the Diamond Princess outbreak has so far offered one of the most stable data sets from which to make calculations- analysis of deaths and infections there put the overall fatality rate at just below 1 per cent. Data out of China found most people (about 80 per cent) recovered from the new virus on their own, even if they developed pneumonia. But about one in five needed more serious medical intervention (such as ventilation to help them breathe) and, of those, 6 per cent were pushed into critical care – as multiple organs began to fail along with the lungs, or septic shock (whole-body infection) set in. Anyone can catch the virus – but people most at risk of complications are older or have other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, making their bodies may be less able to cope with the extra strain. Smokers are also more likely to develop a nasty infection, as the virus breeds via cell receptors in the lungs known to increase with cigarette smoke. Experts say the higher the dose of virus you are hit with, the faster you will show symptoms and the more dangerous it can be for your immune system to fight off. For example, catching the virus from a doorknob is likely to give you a smaller dose than caring for an infected person without protective clothing such as a mask. For more on how the new virus affects the body and what it feels like to get it, you can read this explainer here. Difficulty breathing is the main reason that people with COVID-19 present to a hospital, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. The virus, which attacks the lungs, can progress quite quickly, worsening beyond shortness of breath. Once admitted to a ward and receiving oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but other people will need increasing amounts of support to keep their lungs sending oxygen throughout their body. ""That’s where intensive care would step in,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “If it’s bad enough that you need to be put on a breathing machine then you would definitely be in intensive care. If there was a sense that a patient was deteriorating towards needing a ventilator or a life-support machine, we’d also put them in intensive care. What intensive care is able to offer is the medical specialists and more monitoring … It's very intense – not surprisingly, given the name.” Without a drug that is definitively proven to halt or even slow COVID-19 at this stage, the aim is to support patients until they recover. “We wait for the virus to clear up and then the lungs will often repair themselves if we can wait and just support them while they do that. So you might have a period of, say, a week on a life-support machine where the virus starts to clear itself and the lungs start to improve and then we take the breathing machine away.” Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down. But, as experience has shown worldwide, the outcome is not always positive. “Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “They’re not using as much oxygen as they would normally. The problem with that is it works quite well and it’s a really effective therapy but, obviously, being in that state puts the body in quite a vulnerable position.” There are two problems that can arise, he says. One is that the infection itself can affect the other organs. And there is “just the stress of being so sick”. “We're supposed to be up and walking around but when you’re in intensive care your body is a little bit vulnerable to either getting another infection from bacteria, or the virus itself affecting your other organs. That’s why there is a difference, unfortunately, that people who are a little bit older or those a bit more vulnerable beforehand don’t do as well as people that are younger.” Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” So what would he say to younger people, including those aged 20-29 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria more than any other age group? “Stay home. Do what the government’s asking us to do. Let’s do that for a week or a few months. You’re doing it potentially to protect yourself – it’s not impossible that young people get sick – but you’re really doing it to protect the older people in our community. To me, it’s a real social responsibility. It’s sort of a good test of Australians' ability to look after each other, really. You know, we all like to think we do that – but this is probably the chance to prove it.” Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a ventilator, whether they know it or not. It happens between the bit where you start to feel drowsy – ”you stop breathing and then I put in a breathing tube and put you on to a breathing machine,” says Dr Suzi Nou, president of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists – and the bit where you wake up in the recovery room. That breathing machine is a ventilator, pushing oxygen into your body. “For healthy patients undergoing routine surgery, [when] I stop giving them anaesthetic, they start breathing for themselves,” says Dr Nou. Treating patients with COVID-19, whose lungs are compromised by the disease, is another story. “They’re too unwell to do the job of breathing for themselves. We’d induce the state of sleepiness, put a breathing tube in and put them on the ventilator.” While a patient having routine surgery will rely on a ventilator for minutes or hours – and it’s not uncommon for a patient in intensive care to rely on one for four or five days – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. This is why ventilators have become such a precious commodity worldwide since the pandemic took hold, prompting a doctor in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy to say they had become as precious as gold. There are plans for the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to be doubled to 4000 while more have been freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and still more are now being manufactured in Australia.   But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou and highly trained nurses. In Australia, every patient on a ventilator has a dedicated nurse. It's these professionals who need to be supported to keep coming to work in the coming weeks and months, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Symptoms tend to clear up in just a week or two in mild cases or three to six for more serious, according to WHO data. But early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer in some cases. Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. Experts say it’s too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients. The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home ""where practicable"", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. If you fall into these categories, this measure is designed to protect you, not keep you a prisoner at home. You can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or even the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have also been restricted to protect vulnerable elderly residents. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says Australians weighing up whether to bring elderly relatives home to care for them now face a difficult ""trade-off"". On the one hand, Professor Kelly says ""the most frail, elderly people requiring, for example, a lot of home care ... may be best to shelter with relatives"". But if other family members are going ""out into the world ... and interacting with others"", they risk bringing the virus into the home. The answer isn't always clear-cut and will come down to personal circumstances. While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show concerningly high hospitalisation rates among the under 60s and in Australia there are people under 50 already in need of intensive care. And note this: there have now been more coronavirus cases in both NSW and Victoria among 25- to 29 year-olds than any other age group. In any case, even if you're young and get a milder case you can still spread the virus to someone who might not be so lucky. Aren't you the optimist? The new rules spell the end of the backyard barbecue or the extended family dinner – at least for now. House parties might even become an offence in some states. But experts say these tough temporary measures reflect just how easily the virus can spread. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has warned of a dinner party where one person was infected with COVID-19 – at the start of the night. ""By the end of the dinner party, almost everybody [there] had the coronavirus – this spreads rapidly,"" he said. Children on school holidays should not have friends over nor hang around shopping centres together, Mr Andrews has said, and it's not a case of moving beers at the pub to the living room. “We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds. That will mean they will die. We’ve got to buy time.” The first NSW COVID-19 cases were reported in Burwood, Parramatta, Randwick and Ku-Ring-Gai in late January. Clusters of cases began appearing in Ryde, Parramatta, Hornsby and central Sydney in mid-March. The virus began to spread outside Sydney on March 5, with early cases in Goulburn, the Mid-Coast and Orange. It has since spread up and down the state's east coast and in regional areas inland. By the end of March, the biggest clusters – in Waverley, the Northern Beaches and Sydney – had more than 100 cases each. More than 100 cases were linked to three cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, which docked at Circular Quay in late March. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the local government area of Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers of cases have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne. A woman infected with COVID-19 on a ski holiday in the US attended a 21st birthday party in wealthy inner-east Malvern, and at least six guests contracted the virus. On April 1, the Stonnington local government area, which encompasses Malvern, had the highest number of confirmed cases with 77. In recent days there have been cases among retail workers, such as a Coles and K-Mart outlet in Melbourne's east. Hospitals have also been the site of smaller clusters and, as it stands at the moment, about 10 per cent of Victoria's confirmed coronavirus diagnoses have been in healthcare workers. Viruses need hosts to survive – they can't make it on their own. So far, the best evidence we have on how long the virus lasts on surfaces comes from a letter to the editor by a team of American scientists published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s top medical journals. The data is still early stage and needs to be interpreted with caution. They placed samples of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper and tracked what happened to the virus. The virus was the most stable on plastic and stainless steel and could be detected up to 72 hours later. On absorbent surfaces such as cardboard, fabric or paper it degrades much faster. However, the amount of the virus fell quickly over time. On plastic, for example, it halved in about seven hours. That indicates these surfaces do not remain infectious forever. The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus. Using a card is “probably lower risk”, write Professor Ian Mackay and Dr Katherine Arden on The Conversation, because you keep the card and don’t have to touch other people. In fact, using ""tap and pay"" is a social distancing practice recommended by the federal government. - with Liam Mannix You can still order in food but authorities say you shouldn't let the courier into your home and, if in an apartment, you should pick up the order outside rather than inviting them through a security door into a communal area. Professor Doherty says that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're ""taking hold of the pizza box"". ""Before you take the food out, wash your hands and then put the pizza box somewhere out of the way,"" Professor Doherty suggests in a webinar for the Australian Academy of Science. “It can certainly survive longer on plastics and steel ... in the SARS epidemic, of course, we saw people wiping down elevator buttons. […] Just open everything, wash your hands before you take the food out of the plastic and maybe transfer it to another plastic bag before you put it in the fridge."" No. The Centre for Food Safety’s guidelines say there is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. Soap or dishwashing liquid should not be used, as they can stay on food and cause sickness. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus, says Arden. You also don’t need to scrub food that you are going to later peel, such as oranges. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. “Think of your hands as the enemy,” write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden. If the virus comes into contact with your hands, and then you touch your nose, mouth or eyes, it can gain entry to your body. You must wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly before eating. - Liam Mannix We don’t need to be worried about the temperature of a wash because we use strong detergents in our washing powders, even when they are cold wash formulations, says virologist Katherine Ardern and coronavirus expert Associate Professor Ian Mackay, both at the University of Queensland. They cite a recent study, which, although not having yet been through a peer review process so not conclusive, provides an early picture of how the virus reacts in certain conditions. In a laboratory, a 30-minute incubation of the virus at 56C or a five-minute incubation at 70C rendered SARS-CoV-2 inactive. In its recommendations for households where someone is ill, or suspected of being ill with COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends laundering items ""using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items"", and drying the items completely. A similar answer applies as with washing machines. Professor Mackay notes that if you are caring for an ill person, you need to be extra vigilant in cleaning their crockery and cutlery to ensure that you limit the risk of family spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this if someone has COVID-19 in your household: ""The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items."" The NSW Health Department advises using common household disinfectant sprays for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is what is known as an “enveloped virus”, which means it is made of a little ball of fat and protein. That makes it relatively easily to kill with standard disinfectants. In Australia, disinfectants are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so if you pick the right one – look for a specific disinfectant, not a cleaner – you can be confident it works. Not all disinfectants are regulated by the same standards. Look for a specific label on the disinfectant that means it kills viruses, such as virucidal or antiviral activity. Importantly, this is different to antibacterial – antibacterial ingredients kill bacteria, not viruses. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label, which may include cleaning a surface before disinfecting it. Cleaning and disinfecting are different things. As the CDC notes, cleaning does not kill germs in itself but, by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. The Australian Department of Health advises you to target frequently touched surfaces: door handles, bed rails, table tops and light switches. As with all things COVID-19, there is still much we don’t know. The advice above is based on guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guidance from the Australian Department of Health, from the Australian Research Council Training Centre for Food Safety, and expert commentary from Associate Professor Ian Mackay (an expert on coronaviruses) and Katherine Ardern (a virologist), both at the University of Queensland. – Liam Mannix One of the big mysteries of the virus is how infectious asymptomatic people really are. Some experts say people shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, and the WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours before symptoms first appear. But other studies have tracked infections in parts of China and Singapore to “stealth” transmitters with mild or no symptoms. This also played out in the case of the cruise ship turned floating quarantine site the Diamond Princess in early February. A study found that 18 per cent of those infected on board never showed symptoms. Because this virus can spread before symptoms appear, it is especially hard to contain. ""Let's stop saying it's a bad flu,"" pleaded doctor Daniele Macchini, from the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where the virus had gained a deadly foothold. Patients inundating intensive care wards had ""far from the complications of a flu"", the doctor wrote on Facebook in March. While flu has many of the same symptoms and results in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier. In Australia, government figures for the most recent flu season ending October 2019 show 812 people died of influenza out of 298,120 reported cases – a fatality rate of about 0.27 per cent. Emerging coronaviruses such as this strain and SARS can also do more damage to the body, particularly the lungs. And the new virus is more infectious than the flu, or SARS or MERS, with one COVID-19 patient likely to infect between two and three others. Yes, it's possible. As it breeds in the lungs, the virus can impair your body's ability to filter out germs falling down from the upper airways and so leave some people susceptible to another bug – whether the common cold, influenza or a case of bacterial pneumonia. So this year there is a particular urgency behind calls for people to have their flu shots, as hospitals brace for a surge of COVID-19 and flu cases hitting all at once. On April 1, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly urged Australians, especially those aged over 65, to get their flu vaccines as soon as possible. ""As of now there are millions of vaccines out there ready,"" Professor Kelly said. That's the big question. This virus's closest relative, SARS, while deadly, spread more slowly and to far fewer countries and so early containment efforts worked to wipe it out, largely within a year. For COVID-19, many experts are instead drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available – between 12 and 18 months. The virus has now reached most of the world – more than 170 countries, and the World Health Organisation warns it is ""accelerating"". It took the virus 67 days to infect the first 100,000 people, just 11 to reach 200,000 and four to top 300,000. By mid-March in Australia, the number of cases was doubling every three to four days. In recent days, since stricter social distancing rules came into force and more people start to stay home, that growth has slowed but authorities say now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"". Outside China, major clusters of the virus have broken out in Italy, where hospitals have been pushed to the brink as well as the US, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea. Some nations, including many in Europe, have turned to the ""China model"" of forced home quarantines and transport shutdowns to stop the virus. But experts note that China, as well as countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, have also started to ""flatten their curve"" of infection growth through exhaustive testing, contact tracing of known cases and community take-up of ""social distancing"" measures such as working from home or taking schools online. China's success so far means it is already starting to relax many of its lockdowns, even as it braces for a potential second wave. In Italy and now other countries such as Spain, France and the UK, people are only allowed to leave their homes to run essential errands such as grabbing groceries (and they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Anyone caught breaking Singapore's rules can land themselves in prison after the city-state made it an offence for a person to intentionally stand close to another. The main symptoms of the new coronavirus are: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat. Nausea or diarrhea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS, and a blocked nose is less common again. The federal government has ruled people shouldn’t gather together except for “essential” activities such as school, public transport and work – but working from home is strongly encouraged and schools will move to mostly online lessons after Easter, except for students who have to attend in person. Shopping centres will stay open but food courts will be for takeaway only. People are urged to just buy what they need and not collect together or take time browsing. Those indoor gatherings still running should allow space for one person per four square metres. While the government is yet to move towards a full-scale shutdown of all but non-essential services, the following have already closed or suspended: The good news is the other thing shutting down is evictions – with a moratorium on evictions from commercial and residential rental properties as a “result of financial distress"" for the next six months. Services so far considered ""essential"" under a wider shutdown include pharmacies, fuel stations, health care, food shops and public transport and airports. Hairdressers and barbers are not on that list but can remain open for now – though they must strictly manage social distancing and the four-square-metre rule. The federal government says hotels, hostels, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be a decision for each state and territory. All non-urgent elective surgeries are postponed until further notice. Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has written to states and territories urging them to exempt telcos, postal services and media organisations from any future restrictions on movement as ""essential services"". Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses – and funerals must be capped at 10 people, in what the government has called ""very difficult"" but necessary measures. JobSeeker is a payment of $550 a fortnight (now increased to $1100 a fortnight as part of a coronavirus stimulus boost) for those who have lost their employment. JobSeeker replaced the NewStart allowance in March. However, the new JobKeeper scheme is a $1500 payment (before tax) per staff member provided to employers by the government over the next six months to help businesses hold onto workers so that after the pandemic is over they can more easily start over. Employers can only receive the subsidy if they have turnover of less than $1 billion and this figure has fallen by 30 per cent or more, or they have a turnover higher than $1 billion and this has fallen by 50 per cent or more. Employers receiving the subsidy must report to the Australian Tax Office every month. See here for details. – Jennifer Duke At least one in 10 Australians have asthma but the condition doesn’t mean you’re more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack. “It’s a double-whammy, really,” says National Asthma Council Australia chief Siobhan Brophy. Respiratory physician Peter Wark says there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how COVID-19 affects asthmatics but, from previous experience with other respiratory illnesses, they’ll likely be at higher risk of complications – as was observed during the SARS outbreak and still occurs with common illnesses such as cold and flu. The WHO and other health authorities are urging extra precautions for asthmatics. Brophy says now is the time to be on your “best behaviour”: following your asthma plan and doctor’s advice to the letter and re-filling prescriptions so your lungs are in their best shape possible should an infection come. While people without the condition have been hoarding ventolin, she notes there’s little point as the medication is designed to treat an asthma attack and not COVID-19. There has been some concern about continuing asthma medication such as steroid tablets or injections, which could suppress the body's overall immune system, Brophy says, but steroid inhalers are still fine – they only travel to the lungs and remain vital for asthmatics. “Talk to your doctor before you stop taking anything but if you’re still using an old nebuliser to take your medication, use a puffer and a spacer instead. A nebuliser will spray out particles [and possibly germs] from your lungs."" Tell your doctor about your asthma and your medication if you develop symptoms. Replay   Coronaviruses are a family of viruses causing respiratory illness mostly found in animals. Only seven have been identified in humans, including the four that commonly give us coughs and colds. But when a new strain jumps across from wildlife, such as SARS and now this new strain, it can be dangerous as there is no natural immunity to fight it off. Because it's new, at first the virus was known simply as the ""novel"" coronavirus. Then the WHO named it SARS-CoV-2, given it shares so much of its DNA – about 75 per cent – with the SARS-CoV strain behind the SARS outbreak. The illness caused by this current strain is now called COVID-19. The illness was first identified after people started falling ill at wet market reported to sell wild animals in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unfounded theories that the virus is man-made quickly began to circulate online but scientists studying its genome already agree it came from animals - as more than 70 per cent of all new diseases emerging in humans do. Wild animals packed together and then butchered in live markets throughout Asia can be incubators for viruses to evolve and jump species barriers – SARS was traced back to a colony of bats but was believed to have passed into humans again in a wet market via the Himalayan palm civet, an ancient species of mammal eaten as a delicacy in China. And MERS also has bat origins but mostly spreads from infected camels, often in slaughterhouses. Bats are essential to many ecosystems we rely on but, through a lucky quirk in their immune system, they also carry a whole host of diseases that do not harm them. Early work suggests this new virus is 96 per cent similar to a SARS-like strain already discovered in bats a few years back, but experts think it likely first jumped into another animal, possibly the highly endangered and heavily trafficked pangolin, where it gained potency before passing into humans.  The question of who should practice this social distancing (everyone) versus who should seal themselves off completely has sparked some confusion. To stem the spread of COVID-19, millions of people infected or exposed around the world are also being urged to go into voluntary exile at home or in isolation wards. While some people have chosen to start home isolation themselves, thousands of others in Australia been already been issued formal notices to comply as states call in police to help enforce them. We dive into the rules in this explainer here but in brief: if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, then you must self-isolate for a full fortnight (the estimated period of virus incubation before symptoms appear). If you are self-isolating at home, your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food rather than going out, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch out for are a high fever and shortness of breath). If you are infected yourself or awaiting tests, then everyone should stay home. You can still wander into your garden or balcony but, while some officials have said you can walk the dog or stretch your legs, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says you must stay home if you've been told to self-isolate: ""Sorry."" Despite these rules, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said, on March 27, that Australia was still seeing large numbers of returned travellers with the virus and, in many cases, passing it on to their families. “More than two-thirds are returned travellers, and a significant proportion of the other cases have been transmitted from returned travellers,” he said. From March 29, all overseas arrivals are being escorted from airports into hotels and other accommodation for the 14-day window, at the government's expense. The army has been called in alongside police to enforce these quarantines after a number of people were caught out of their homes breaking self-isolation orders. Only if you really have to. Our borders have closed and overseas travel is now banned under biosecurity powers, except in exceptional circumstances. Citizens still travelling abroad are urged to come home as countries impose similar shutdowns of their own. Starting with Tasmania, most states have also started to close their domestic borders - police patrols will now ask people crossing over to go into quarantine for the recommended 14-day window. At this early stage, we are still not absolutely sure how the virus affects women and babies. Different governments have offered different advice.For now, let’s stick to what Australia’s peak body, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZOG), has to say. Note these guidelines are changing regularly and you should check back on their website for the most up-to-date advice. According to guidelines, at this stage it does not appear that pregnant women are at greater risk from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - like they were during the world's last pandemic Swine Flu in 2009.  However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. There is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or birth abnormalities, nor is there evidence the virus can pass from woman to unborn child or via breastmilk. “The safest place to birth your baby is in a hospital, where you have access to highly trained staff and emergency facilities,” the guidelines state. If the mother is infected at the time of birth, she should not be separated from her newborn, but should wear a mask and take precautions. The health advice is the same for pregnant women as it is for everyone else: work from home, avoid public places, and nail your hand hygiene. The RANZCOG guidelines suggest visitors in hospital are limited only to the immediate partner. But this is just a suggestion – different hospitals will have different rules. No. Public transport is still running as it is considered one of the essential activities exempt from the government's ban on gatherings but cleaning has been ramped up. While calls are growing from some experts to shut down public transport already, many people rely on it. Still, as social distancing rules come into force, travellers are deserting normally packed routes in droves. When on public transport, health officials say you should allow room for others as much as possible, rather than crowding in. It's also important to keep an eye on what you've been touching. If you then touch your face, a virus surviving on, say, a metal handrail could jump across – so carry a disinfectant or even wear one (stylish) glove for holding on and touching things. It appears that, as with SARS, it's possible for our pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about a pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a ""weak positive"" test for COVID-19, the WHO stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people, and no one should abandon their animals. Hong Kong authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners. (And the recent case of a tiger with another mild case in New York's Bronx Zoo has been linked to a sick staff member). The risk instead would come in if a pet itself became a contaminated ""surface"" (from all those sloppy kisses). You should exercise the usual cautions around animals, washing your hands after touching them. The most hopeful estimates fall within the range of 12 to 18 months. A report for the British government put it at “potentially 18 months or more”. Why? Because making a vaccine is really, really hard. To make a vaccine, you first need to design a way of giving a human immunity against a virus. Then you need to make sure the vaccine is not toxic. Then you need to test it in animals. Then you need to test it in humans – and the tests need to be large so we can make sure it works and is safe. And then you need to make the billions of doses needed. And there is every chance a vaccine that looks promising in the lab, or in animal tests, won’t work in humans. Experts are hoping to roll out a safe vaccine within 18 months. But even that would be unprecedented. No vaccine has ever been developed that quickly. - Liam Mannix, science reporter The Peter Doherty Institute in Australia is working on both a vaccine and a potential therapeutic treatment for the virus, and director Sharon Lewin says the latter might offer a faster fix. A drug that could block the virus from replicating in the body (or calm down the body's intense immune response to it) could keep patients with severe infections alive and, in the case of an antiviral, reduce transmission. Several existing drugs are now being trialled against the new virus worldwide, including those used to treat HIV, malaria, and arthritis. The results look promising but it's not time to rush out to the pharmacy just yet. It took this new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first thousand people. By contrast, SARS took 130 days and the less infectious MERS more than two years to infect a thousand people after it emerged in 2012. When SARS finished its spread after nine months in 2003, only 8098 cases had been confirmed across 26 countries but close to 10 per cent of those were fatal. (Most clusters happened in hospitals or households.) MERS has been circulating for eight years across 27 countries so far, and kills about a third of those who fall ill – out of about 2500 confirmed cases. Ebola is even more deadly, killing more than 40 per cent of those diagnosed over a number of outbreaks since the 1970s but it has been reported in just a handful of countries. In the pandemic records, the infamous 1918 Spanish flu killed about 2.5 per cent of its victims over two years – but because it infected so many people (close to 27 per cent of the world's population) at a time of much cruder medical care, about 50 million died. Today, doctors are much better able to stave off secondary bacterial infections, which proved particularly deadly during that outbreak. And, unlike the Spanish flu, young people are not dying at the same high rates. The last pandemic was swine flu in 2009, the second coming of a H1N1 influenza that infected between 11 and 21 per cent of the world's population. Governments mounted costly responses until it was ruled to be over in October 2010. But the virus killed about 285,000 people (fewer than seasonal flu normally does) with a relatively low fatality rate of .02 per cent, and the WHO copped criticism for labelling it a pandemic at all.

""While I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,"" Mr Tehan wrote. He said the students might be children of essential workers but added pupils should ""not be refused physical classroom access based on their parent's employment"". Under federal legislation, Mr Tehan has the authority to impose additional conditions on funding for private schools. He said he was using this power to include a condition starting from term two ""requiring schools to provide a physical classroom education environment for the children of parents who choose to access it"". Mr Tehan told reporters on Thursday he wanted schools to be open for safety reasons. ""We want them open so children can be safely cared for if their parents are working or if there are other reasons where children are much more safe at school rather than at home,"" he said. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week? Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students – would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" Victorian students are scheduled to return to school on April 14 under an online learning model. NSW students are due to return on April 27. Attendance, which plummeted in March, could rise after the holidays. Medical officials are looking at how to make schools safer, with bolstered hygiene and social distancing measures.

Bitter disputes have broken out across the sector as thousands of residents plan a rent strike and owners fear they will lose thousands of dollars in rent, with no government guarantees to ensure repayment when the economy comes out the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Sydney business owner Kyara Coakes outside the warehouse for her property-styling business. Credit:James Brickwood Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar has called for at least a 50 per cent waiver of all rent for businesses in financial distress, warning they will be saddled with debt if they come out of hibernation without some of their rent dismissed altogether. But landlords say they are being forced to act as guarantors for businesses and would have no way of recouping deferred rent payments if their tenants went bankrupt during the crisis. On Tuesday morning, a neighbour alerted property stylist Kyara Coakes her landlord was out the front of her Chatswood business. Her rent was three days late. She had asked for a pause in her $7000-a-month repayments as her revenue dropped 90 per cent when house inspection after house inspection was cancelled. ""There are only two ways of resolving the issues – full payment [or] terminate the contract,"" her landlord had responded in an email. ""I was just really shocked,"" Ms Coakes said. ""She came to the property, threatening me and saying she would change the locks that afternoon."" The national cabinet announced a moratorium on evictions a week earlier but the states have yet to legislate on the issue, which means landlords are still within their rights to take action of the kind in Ms Coakes' situation. Government leaders have urged landlords and tenants to ""work it out between themselves"". On Tuesday, a mandatory code of conduct was formalised meaning landlords would be forced to waive and defer lease repayments in proportion to the loss of income experienced by a business, but this has also yet to be legislated. Replay   Ms Coakes' landlord, hospital software supplier Amy Luo, said her threats to evict Ms Coakes were part of her negotiating tactics. Ms Luo, who also owns property upstairs, said she had not actually changed the locks on Ms Coakes' business. She said the coronavirus had placed owners, tenants and businesses in an invidious position. ""Our government effectively asks all the small or large landlords to become the untitled banks for financing all the failed businesses,"" Ms Luo said. ""It's going to be such a mess. I have a bank loan. I have employees I need to pay. My business is also suffering. I don't share her profit. Why should I share her loss?"" Ms Luo said she had given Ms Coakes four days to come up with an alternative plan. ""I cannot offer any reduction in rent right now until I am clear with the government arrangements,"" she said. Landlords can apply to their banks for mortgage relief if they are experiencing financial distress but this will need to be paid back over the life of the loan. The Grattan Insitute's budget policy director, Danielle Wood, on Thursday said the government's rental response was ""half-baked"" and would mean many businesses did not make it through the coronavirus hibernation period without further government rental support. ""The code ultimately falls short on scale, scope, and speed,"" she said. In the residential sector, both NSW and Victoria have committed to the principle of land tax discounts in exchange for rental reductions but have not released any firm policies on how this would be delivered, leaving landlords and tenants frustrated as negotiations break down. Real estate agent Kirk Stafford said the industry was ""being besieged by tenant activists who are advising their cohort to simply strike and refuse to pay rent"". Tenants Victoria said it was hearing daily stories of ""no tolerance for people who fall behind in the rent"" even if they had lost their jobs because of coronavirus.

19,/national/nsw/for-those-ready-to-cast-blame-over-ruby-princess-consider-the-dianne-brimble-tragedy-20200407-p54hs4.html,"For those ready to cast blame over Ruby Princess, consider the Dianne Brimble tragedy","Death, a cruise ship, a homicide investigation. While the fateful events unfolded slowly and quietly in the cabins, passengers continued to party, enjoying their holiday of a lifetime and, until the end, the cruise company ensured it was business as usual, and life on board went on. While the scale of the disaster that is the Ruby Princess is far greater, and its global context unprecedented in modern times, there are striking similarities with another cruise ship death – that of Brisbane mother Dianne Brimble, who died alone in September 2002 on board the Pacific Sky. Dianne Brimble: A cruise ship tragedy that provides a cautionary tale about leaping to conclusions before a thorough investigation of the Ruby Princess case.  Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. That said, cruise companies are businesses.

While the fateful events unfolded slowly and quietly in the cabins, passengers continued to party, enjoying their holiday of a lifetime and, until the end, the cruise company ensured it was business as usual, and life on board went on. While the scale of the disaster that is the Ruby Princess is far greater, and its global context unprecedented in modern times, there are striking similarities with another cruise ship death – that of Brisbane mother Dianne Brimble, who died alone in September 2002 on board the Pacific Sky. Dianne Brimble: A cruise ship tragedy that provides a cautionary tale about leaping to conclusions before a thorough investigation of the Ruby Princess case.  Brimble died from respiratory failure after consuming a mixture of alcohol and the drug GHB. It was a sad and sordid tale, and eight young men from Adelaide were cast in the role of the villains. The case made headlines across Australia for months because of a high-profile coroner’s inquest; significant media attention caused police to call in the homicide squad for a second, more thorough investigation. Then, as now, police confronted a difficult task: a large number of witnesses, conflicting versions of events, the passage of time, an inaccessible and contaminated crime scene (quite literally, in the current case). Apart from the practicalities, the legal issues involved were as complex as the coroner’s investigation was lengthy. Presumably police lawyers have already started looking at the laws of the sea to determine if they have jurisdiction, in case some of the crucial events happened in international waters. In the case of Brimble much depended on the exact cause of death, and whether any person could be criminally responsible for it. Lawyers argued about whether it was manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, or manslaughter by gross criminal negligence, decisions which effect what police need to prove, and how they obtain that evidence. In the Ruby Princess case, the Attorney-General has foreshadowed the possibility of a civil fraud case, raising further interesting legal issues. Then as now, there is the possibility of a parallel civil compensation case by the families of the victims against the cruise company. The potential damage here is counted in significant sums of money, the company’s reputation and, potentially, its survival. The media’s role in the Brimble case can hardly be overstated, and it was a driving force also in bringing about the investigation into recent events on board the Ruby Princess and upon its disembarkation at Sydney. While journalists reporting on the inquest into Brimble’s death were certain they knew who the culprit was and what happened, slowly a different, more nuanced story emerged. Many in the media never quite got on board. It was not as palatable, the lines between hero and villain were blurred and the public had long since been sold a different version of the truth. In the end there was no evidence to sustain a manslaughter charge, but many lives were ruined in the process. This may serve as a cautionary tale for anyone who is too certain they already know who is to blame for the Ruby Princess fiasco, and who should pay. That said, cruise companies are businesses. They know the basic rules of public relations: co-operate with the investigation, apologise, replace the chief executive, all in the hope it will allow survival long enough to start a new chapter. Cruise passenger numbers actually exploded after Brimble’s death, despite the negative publicity. Cruising will likely survive this crisis too.

Then you need a family meeting. That’s the advice of Kate Christie, time management specialist and author of Me First: The Guilt-free Guide to Prioritising You. The first and only agenda of the meeting, says Christie, is agreeing as a family who is going to do what and when. Family is a team sport, it's time for everyone to step up and pitch in.Credit:iStock “Say, ‘As Mum, these are the four things I'm going to do — I'm going to cook three nights a week, I'm going to do four loads of washing a week, and I'm going to do x and y. If there’s [another parent or partner], they say what they are going to do. And then you say to your kids, ‘what are you going to do?’.” Christie says it’s important that kids who are old enough write down what they are going to do so that they feel they contributed to the development of the plan. If kids aren’t old enough to write then get them to draw pictures of their plan instead. “The worst thing you can do is tell them, here's the calendar that I've set up and everyone has to do it,” says Christie. “They need to feel a sense of ownership in it, because when they do come and complain, which they will, you can say, well guys, we built the calendar together.” Replay   The next step is to draw up a daily routine with batches of time which, depending on the age of your kids, should be between 30 minutes and an hour. “Group like activities together so that you get them done in one solid batch of time,” says Christie. “We work best when we single task rather than multi-task. This applies to kids as well.” Include everything in your plan, not just work. That means write down your morning/getting up routine, exercise, work time, play time, chore time, quiet time and meals. “Plan this with the kids, for example, ‘From 9am to 9.45am, mum is going to be doing work. You need to do an activity on your own’,” says Christie. “Depending on the age of the kids it could be doing some homework, they could be planning their vision board, they could be online researching their trip around Australia, they could be doing art and craft.” Christie recommends timing each block with a wind-up timer, like the one on your oven. Stay away from alarms on your computer or phone because that’s likely to lead to distractions. “When you batch your day, everyone knows what's on the agenda that you've all agreed to. And for those 45-minute bursts where you actually have to get some work done you've already pre-planned what the kids are going to do,” says Christie. “If the kids come and annoy you, say, 'Come on, we agreed to this batch, but as soon as the alarm goes off we're having hot chocolate'.” Don’t forget to add in some “me first” time in your schedule, such as a run or walk on your own, a bath, or reading a book in your bedroom. During this time you can get your kids to also read a book, or colour in, or just plonk them in front of the TV for an hour. Once you’ve planned out – and everyone has agreed to – the family schedule, leave it in the kitchen to keep everyone accountable. “You may have to say, ‘who's on dishwasher today?’, but that's okay because I'd rather you be the person who reminds rather than the person who does.” If this whole family schedule thing is starting to sound too much like boot camp, don’t worry, there is still room for spontaneity and going with the flow. “Some days your kids are going to find an activity, and they are going to have laser focus on it, and for whatever reason they get into it. You have to be ready for that. On those days for God's sake leave them to it and have your to-do lists ready to go, so that you can work systematically through things for those miraculous times when the kids are self-sufficient."" But let’s be honest, that’s the best-case scenario. Other days are going to be all over the shop. If you do hit some hurdles, Christie’s advice is to lower your expectations. “I would be aiming for two really good solid 45-minute batches of work per day,” says Christie. “There are going to be times when you're going crazy and they're going crazy, but if you set up enough structure and try to stick to it at least 50 per cent of the time, that is better than just freewheeling 100 per cent of the time.” Me First: The Guilt Free Guide to Prioritising You by Kate Christie (Wiley) is available now.

25,/national/what-s-the-death-rate-how-long-will-it-last-your-covid-19-questions-answered-20200323-p54cy7.html,Can you catch the virus from the air? Should we wear masks? Your COVID-19 questions answered,"Since it emerged in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million people and claimed 80,000 lives. To stop a pandemic that spreads from person to person in close quarters, the world has largely shut down, with borders closed, streets empty and whole cities going into quarantine. Australia has its own strict measures to avoid the terrible scenes playing out in places such as Italy and the United States, where hospital systems are now being overwhelmed. We are told to live our lives further apart – literally – by avoiding gatherings, staying home and keeping 1.5 metres clear of each other.  As we learn more about this virus, questions from you, our readers, are flooding in. Our explainer team, as well as our health, science and data reporters, will answer as many of them as we can. And when new information comes to light, we'll bring you updates too – with the latest featured up top in this story. Here's what we know so far. While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk may have been underestimated. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet (which are classed as anything more than five microns in size). They can leave the body as both. It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s, they only travel a metre. But we know more now.   “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. Professor Morawska, who heads up the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology,  is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for potential aerosol transmission. On April 9, the Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading frequently in the air, even if it's possible. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would be likely look different - more infectious and striking down more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results – some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska notes, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. The warmer the conditions, the faster they tend to break up. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours but the WHO has since pointed out that it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus generally aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO itself has issued warnings to healthcare workers that this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 operate as if the infection is airborne, including in Australia.  ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Face masks can protect against the droplets that spread the virus and are now a common sight on the streets of many cities around the world such as Hong Kong. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put healthcare workers at risk. All the same, calls are growing in many Western countries for a wider take-up of face masks to slow outbreaks. In the US, the CDC has already reversed its own advice, now urging people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Professor Morawska agrees with the move, saying masks aren't needed outdoors but are a good idea where ventilation is poor. But Professor MacIntyre and Associate Professor Senanayake say they are not as necessary in Australia as in places such as New York, where community transmission is now rampant. It’s also unclear how much home-made masks or bandannas and scarves will block virus-laden droplets. Some experts warn widespread use of DIY masks could leave people with a false sense of security - and an urge to touch (and so possibly contaminate) their face more often as they adjust them. Australian health authorities have indicated they are reviewing their own advice on masks, as they do all their guidelines, but stress it still stands. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has urged people not to ""waste"" masks and notes they should be handled carefully and changed regularly (Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty recommends sterilising used masks rather than throwing them away, given the shortage).   Right now, health authorities say anyone who spends more than two hours in an enclosed room with an infected person has been exposed to the virus. But Professor Morawska warns there needs to be more focus on the need to opt for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. Associate Professor Senanayake says air conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the Department of Health agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low outside healthcare settings. NSW Health said air conditioners and heating were safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and if possible, use a different bathroom...to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets...and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne."" Yes. Some people will be infected without symptoms or very mild symptoms. To test for COVID-19 right now, clinicians need to either take a direct sample of the virus, from a throat or nose swab or in lung phlegm, and examine its genetic code. Those tests are considered very accurate but in some cases if they miss the virus – say, because it is further down in the lungs and someone doesn’t cough up any phlegm (or sputum) – they can return a false negative. That’s why tests are often repeated, especially for patients recovering and returning to the community. Blood tests, which look for the body’s immune response to the infection, can also be used but are not yet widely available outside China, and bring their own false negative risks – antibodies deployed by the body to fight off the virus can take more than a week to form so may not show up if the test is performed too early into the illness. This is also true of the rapid finger-prick tests being checked in Australia right now by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after problems overseas. A government spokesman said these are therefore not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA sample or PCR test and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. Scientists aren’t sure yet but they think it most likely. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with those aforementioned antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Many experts say reports of people appearing to catch this new virus twice are probably best explained by false negative tests clearing them of the infection too early (when the virus had actually remained in their system) rather than catching it a second time. Associate Professor Senanayake says the virus collected by the later tests may even be dead. Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. Countries that have ""flattened their curve"" and dramatically slowed outbreaks have carried out exhaustive testing and contact tracing. In many cases, people without symptoms are tested and health officials actively hunt for others, checking temperatures on entry to buildings. Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries (more than 300,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still fairly strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. Amid increasing calls from the WHO to ""test all suspected cases"", Australia has since ramped up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expanded that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also started in areas identified as at risk of community transmission, such as Sydney. Some states are taking matters into their own hands. On April 6, the ACT began random sample testing of those with symptoms but no other risk factors as did Queensland in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast. That followed news that Victoria would expand testing to people aged over 65, Indigenous Australians, cruise-ship passengers, people in high-risk settings such as prisons, schools, childcare and homelessness and disability support as well as police and firefighters. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says he supports more widespread testing but stresses there is still a ""temporary"" shortage of testing kits. Faster finger prick tests that tell if someone has antibodies against the virus (and so has it or has fought it off) in their blood are also being checked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. But a government spokesman said these are not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA test because such antibodies can take between five and seven days of infection to develop and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. The spokesman did not give a timeline of Australia's work to fix the testing-kit shortage but said it was ""working with public and private laboratories and with pathology suppliers to understand both international and domestic supply capacity and capability and are exploring the possibility of building further domestic capability to produce tests and reagents for COVID-19"". They also did not answer questions on how kits are being distributed to the states, as some push ahead with their own expanded testing. Australia has one of the lowest positive rates for testing in the world, Professor Murphy says, meaning authorities feel ""reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of cases in Australia and that means we can get on top of cases"" through contact tracing. That's in contrast to countries such as Iran, Italy and even the US, where Australian authorities say they likely only tested the more severe cases or, as Murphy puts it, ""when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in community that were undetected"". Still, at times Australian authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, hundreds of whom later tested positive. But the states have also threatened hefty fines and even jail time for those at risk of spreading the virus who break home quarantine orders. Anyone following the international news on the pandemic will have noticed a marked variation in death rates from Covid-19 among different countries. In hard-hit Italy, for instance, the death rate among confirmed cases is around 12 per cent in the first week of April, compared with 1.75 per cent in Germany and – thus far – less than 1 per cent here. East Asian countries have generally done better, the UK, Spain and the US worse. A number of factors help account for this variation. The most significant is that the death rate will largely reflect how widely you are testing, and the age groups you test in. If, as in Germany, you test a very large number of people, many of whom are young with mild symptoms, you get a lower rate of death overall. If, as in the UK and US, you only test those who are very ill and in hospital, the converse applies: your death rate looks much higher. Per head of population, Australia’s testing regime has been ahead of many other countries. Other factors that contribute to varying death rates include: demographics such as the age profile of a country’s population overall; density of living conditions; patterns of interaction between different generations; cultural factors (such as the absence of social kissing and handshaking in Japan); and, importantly, the capacity of health systems to cope with the very ill. Germany has more than double Italy’s number of acute care beds per 100,000 people, and more than triple the UK’s acute bed capacity. In Italy, with one of the oldest populations in Europe, researchers believe that deeply ingrained habits of adult children living with, or remaining housed close to, their parents has contributed to the high fatality rate there. Younger adults, commuting into larger employment centres where the virus had been silently spreading, bring the virus back to the smaller communities where their parents live. Smoking rates may be a factor in some places. The jury is out on whether seasonality (whether a country is going into warmer or cooler weather) plays a role. – Deborah Snow No matter where you live, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised that there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Here's the boiled-down version texted to thousands of Australians: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care."" Whenever you go out you must stick with just those in your household or up to one other external person, and you should keep your distance from others (about two steps or 1.5 metres). Wash or sanitise your hands regularly and ditch the handshake and the kiss hello. In enforcing these rules, authorities are emphasising a ""common sense"" approach. As NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says: ""If you're questioning whether you should be doing something, best to give it a miss."" We put a list of your questions to governments and are including the answers below, as we get them, and in more detail in this dedicated explainer here. On April 3, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""Doesn't matter what temperature it is, if it's a warm day, don't go in masses down to the beach."" The key word here is masses. No state has outlawed a trip to the beach (or the park) but they are urging people to reconsider whether the visit is necessary and warn new rules against gatherings may be enforced. Queensland police have closed some beaches, discouraged people from travelling long distances to them. Victoria also advises people to ""keep visits short and maintain physical distancing at all times"". A walk or a quick swim is ok, sunbaking probably not.  You can still hop in the car on your way to exercise but all states advise limiting travel. In Victoria, a government spokeswoman said on April 1, you should only drive in cars with people you live with, but advice since released says you can still use taxis and other ride-share services for ""permitted purposes"". WA advises sitting in the back if getting a taxi or an Uber and Tasmania also encourages people to extend physical distancing to car travel. ""Travelling in cars is not restricted ... non-essential travel is,"" a Tasmanian government spokeswoman said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio people should not be going anywhere just for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out of the car. ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Not all states answered questions on whether learner drivers could still go out for driving practice but in Victoria, learner driving lessons should only be part of essential travel, such as to the supermarket.But NSW Police have ruled that learner driver lessons can continue – for an instructor it could be considered work that cannot be done from home and for the learner it is ""akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Family members can also take learners out for a lesson or for other essential travel. See more here. It depends on the circumstances – and again on what state you live in. The question of romantic partners who don't cohabit initially caused particular consternation when NSW and Victoria both ruled out social visits under their new emergency powers. You can still visit someone's house to care for them, drop off supplies or in an emergency – say, if you are fleeing danger, but in Victoria Police Minister Lisa Neville said on March 31 ""you cannot visit your partner for social reasons"". On the morning of April 1, a Victorian health department spokeswoman added: ""You shouldn't be physically intimate with people you're not living with, even if they are your partner."" But, later in the day, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton announced the rules around romantic partners – which by then had become known as the ""bonk ban"" – would be relaxed with a new exemption for couples. In NSW, Police Commissioner Mick Fuller made a similar exemption, saying you can still visit your partner as it falls under the category of ""care"". ""Mental health, we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you"". Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as Tasmania and the ACT still let you have up to two visitors over to your home at one time as long as you are following social distancing measures – no hugging or kissing, and allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In Queensland,you can have two visitors to each household - but no strangers are allowed over. In all states, tradesman, cleaners, even removalists are allowed if you really need them or may fall under caring but physical distancing must be maintained. – with Lydia Lynch While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear, although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. Victoria has since clarified its own rules to allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. But older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia’s chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  - with Noel Towell Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"" as new data shows tough new social distancing measures are slowing down the virus' spread in Australia. All states have issued similiar advice, warning a migration to the coast could spread the virus further and put dangerous strain on regional health resources. But not all are fining people for ducking down to the holiday house. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said police don't have the resources to enforce the advice over the upcoming Easter weekend but stressed ""this is not a holiday weekend, we can't have a normal Easter"" and state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says if you've booked a holiday you should cancel it. Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them as a household. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for supplies; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. Camping or setting up a caravan somewhere is out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental either. Airbnb now have cancellation policies in place to get a full refund if you booked before March 14. NSW says people shouldn't go on holidays or use Airbnb unless it's for an essential reason such as work and police have revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. See more here.  In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, “Easter holidays are cancelled this year”. Queensland police have flagged they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. - with Stuart Layt, Tammy Mills, Michael Evans, Hannah Barry, Michael Fowler If you have to. You can even have removalists provided you adhere to physical distancing rules. The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow its infection rate by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing As the world waits for a vaccine, this will save lives by helping stop a surge of cases overwhelming emergency departments all at once. Along with measures such as lockdowns and tracing and isolating cases, social distancing has worked against outbreaks in the past, including the Spanish Flu of 1918. The recent surge in Australian cases has started to slow a little in recent days as new rules come into force. But if people do not follow them, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns that Australia could lose its window to contain the outbreak – and cases could rapidly explode. . The federal government has stopped tracking recovery numbers in Australia, drawing criticism from some experts who say it is an important measure of any outbreak. Amid a shortage of testing kits, an Australian government spokesman confirmed only healthcare and aged care workers returning to the frontline must be ""cleared"" with testing (two negative tests) under the national guidelines. Local health authorities keep a close eye on all confirmed cases on the virus and others may still be retested. But most, such as those recovering in home isolation, only have to meet the following conditions: The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention advises the same 72-hour window of time after symptoms disappear but some studies overseas have shown the virus can live in the body for weeks after. The Australian government spokesman said ""a small proportion of people may have an illness that has completely resolved but their [tests] remain persistently positive"". There a decision on release from isolation will be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting their doctor, the testing lab and the public health unit. The 72-hour rule was decided by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which advises Health Minister Greg Hunt, as ""a precautionary period to manage uncertainty around how long a confirmed case remains infectious post-symptom resolution"", the spokesman said. ""Even in these patients there is uncertainty around whether there is a direct correlation of persistent [positive tests] and infectivity, but what we know from other virus infection, it is not a neat correlation,"" he said. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve."" Wash your hands after holding your cup. ""It's all about interrupting the chance of self-inoculation,"" says Associate Professor Ian Mackay, an expert on coronaviruses, at the University of Queensland. The virus has been found to last for shorter periods on card and paper than some other surfaces but it can persist, according to lab studies. ""Whether there is ever likely to be enough virus on that surface to infect another person remains an unanswered question,"" says Professor Mackay. ""The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus.""    Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science – people may be diagnosed or succumb to the illness further down the line. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the WHO estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV, which also caused global panic when it exploded onto the scene in late 2002, and MERS-CoV, which causes a condition more deadly again known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). On the raw figures so far, more than 1.4 million people have been infected worldwide and at least 81,000 have died. About 298,000 have already ""officially"" recovered. The case of the Diamond Princess outbreak has so far offered one of the most stable data sets from which to make calculations- analysis of deaths and infections there put the overall fatality rate at just below 1 per cent. Data out of China found most people (about 80 per cent) recovered from the new virus on their own, even if they developed pneumonia. But about one in five needed more serious medical intervention (such as ventilation to help them breathe) and, of those, 6 per cent were pushed into critical care – as multiple organs began to fail along with the lungs, or septic shock (whole-body infection) set in. Anyone can catch the virus – but people most at risk of complications are older or have other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, making their bodies may be less able to cope with the extra strain. Smokers are also more likely to develop a nasty infection, as the virus breeds via cell receptors in the lungs known to increase with cigarette smoke. Experts say the higher the dose of virus you are hit with, the faster you will show symptoms and the more dangerous it can be for your immune system to fight off. For example, catching the virus from a doorknob is likely to give you a smaller dose than caring for an infected person without protective clothing such as a mask. For more on how the new virus affects the body and what it feels like to get it, you can read this explainer here. Difficulty breathing is the main reason that people with COVID-19 present to a hospital, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. The virus, which attacks the lungs, can progress quite quickly, worsening beyond shortness of breath. Once admitted to a ward and receiving oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but other people will need increasing amounts of support to keep their lungs sending oxygen throughout their body. ""That’s where intensive care would step in,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “If it’s bad enough that you need to be put on a breathing machine then you would definitely be in intensive care. If there was a sense that a patient was deteriorating towards needing a ventilator or a life-support machine, we’d also put them in intensive care. What intensive care is able to offer is the medical specialists and more monitoring … It's very intense – not surprisingly, given the name.” Without a drug that is definitively proven to halt or even slow COVID-19 at this stage, the aim is to support patients until they recover. “We wait for the virus to clear up and then the lungs will often repair themselves if we can wait and just support them while they do that. So you might have a period of, say, a week on a life-support machine where the virus starts to clear itself and the lungs start to improve and then we take the breathing machine away.” Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down. But, as experience has shown worldwide, the outcome is not always positive. “Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “They’re not using as much oxygen as they would normally. The problem with that is it works quite well and it’s a really effective therapy but, obviously, being in that state puts the body in quite a vulnerable position.” There are two problems that can arise, he says. One is that the infection itself can affect the other organs. And there is “just the stress of being so sick”. “We're supposed to be up and walking around but when you’re in intensive care your body is a little bit vulnerable to either getting another infection from bacteria, or the virus itself affecting your other organs. That’s why there is a difference, unfortunately, that people who are a little bit older or those a bit more vulnerable beforehand don’t do as well as people that are younger.” Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” So what would he say to younger people, including those aged 20-29 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria more than any other age group? “Stay home. Do what the government’s asking us to do. Let’s do that for a week or a few months. You’re doing it potentially to protect yourself – it’s not impossible that young people get sick – but you’re really doing it to protect the older people in our community. To me, it’s a real social responsibility. It’s sort of a good test of Australians' ability to look after each other, really. You know, we all like to think we do that – but this is probably the chance to prove it.” Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a ventilator, whether they know it or not. It happens between the bit where you start to feel drowsy – ”you stop breathing and then I put in a breathing tube and put you on to a breathing machine,” says Dr Suzi Nou, president of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists – and the bit where you wake up in the recovery room. That breathing machine is a ventilator, pushing oxygen into your body. “For healthy patients undergoing routine surgery, [when] I stop giving them anaesthetic, they start breathing for themselves,” says Dr Nou. Treating patients with COVID-19, whose lungs are compromised by the disease, is another story. “They’re too unwell to do the job of breathing for themselves. We’d induce the state of sleepiness, put a breathing tube in and put them on the ventilator.” While a patient having routine surgery will rely on a ventilator for minutes or hours – and it’s not uncommon for a patient in intensive care to rely on one for four or five days – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. This is why ventilators have become such a precious commodity worldwide since the pandemic took hold, prompting a doctor in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy to say they had become as precious as gold. There are plans for the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to be doubled to 4000 while more have been freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and still more are now being manufactured in Australia.   But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou and highly trained nurses. In Australia, every patient on a ventilator has a dedicated nurse. It's these professionals who need to be supported to keep coming to work in the coming weeks and months, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Symptoms tend to clear up in just a week or two in mild cases or three to six for more serious, according to WHO data. But early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer in some cases. Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. Experts say it’s too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients. The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home ""where practicable"", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. If you fall into these categories, this measure is designed to protect you, not keep you a prisoner at home. You can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or even the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have also been restricted to protect vulnerable elderly residents. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says Australians weighing up whether to bring elderly relatives home to care for them now face a difficult ""trade-off"". On the one hand, Professor Kelly says ""the most frail, elderly people requiring, for example, a lot of home care ... may be best to shelter with relatives"". But if other family members are going ""out into the world ... and interacting with others"", they risk bringing the virus into the home. The answer isn't always clear-cut and will come down to personal circumstances. While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show concerningly high hospitalisation rates among the under 60s and in Australia there are people under 50 already in need of intensive care. And note this: there have now been more coronavirus cases in both NSW and Victoria among 25- to 29 year-olds than any other age group. In any case, even if you're young and get a milder case you can still spread the virus to someone who might not be so lucky. Aren't you the optimist? The new rules spell the end of the backyard barbecue or the extended family dinner – at least for now. House parties might even become an offence in some states. But experts say these tough temporary measures reflect just how easily the virus can spread. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has warned of a dinner party where one person was infected with COVID-19 – at the start of the night. ""By the end of the dinner party, almost everybody [there] had the coronavirus – this spreads rapidly,"" he said. Children on school holidays should not have friends over nor hang around shopping centres together, Mr Andrews has said, and it's not a case of moving beers at the pub to the living room. “We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds. That will mean they will die. We’ve got to buy time.” The first NSW COVID-19 cases were reported in Burwood, Parramatta, Randwick and Ku-Ring-Gai in late January. Clusters of cases began appearing in Ryde, Parramatta, Hornsby and central Sydney in mid-March. The virus began to spread outside Sydney on March 5, with early cases in Goulburn, the Mid-Coast and Orange. It has since spread up and down the state's east coast and in regional areas inland. By the end of March, the biggest clusters – in Waverley, the Northern Beaches and Sydney – had more than 100 cases each. More than 100 cases were linked to three cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, which docked at Circular Quay in late March. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the local government area of Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers of cases have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne. A woman infected with COVID-19 on a ski holiday in the US attended a 21st birthday party in wealthy inner-east Malvern, and at least six guests contracted the virus. On April 1, the Stonnington local government area, which encompasses Malvern, had the highest number of confirmed cases with 77. In recent days there have been cases among retail workers, such as a Coles and K-Mart outlet in Melbourne's east. Hospitals have also been the site of smaller clusters and, as it stands at the moment, about 10 per cent of Victoria's confirmed coronavirus diagnoses have been in healthcare workers. Viruses need hosts to survive – they can't make it on their own. So far, the best evidence we have on how long the virus lasts on surfaces comes from a letter to the editor by a team of American scientists published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s top medical journals. The data is still early stage and needs to be interpreted with caution. They placed samples of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper and tracked what happened to the virus. The virus was the most stable on plastic and stainless steel and could be detected up to 72 hours later. On absorbent surfaces such as cardboard, fabric or paper it degrades much faster. However, the amount of the virus fell quickly over time. On plastic, for example, it halved in about seven hours. That indicates these surfaces do not remain infectious forever. The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus. Using a card is “probably lower risk”, write Professor Ian Mackay and Dr Katherine Arden on The Conversation, because you keep the card and don’t have to touch other people. In fact, using ""tap and pay"" is a social distancing practice recommended by the federal government. - with Liam Mannix You can still order in food but authorities say you shouldn't let the courier into your home and, if in an apartment, you should pick up the order outside rather than inviting them through a security door into a communal area. Professor Doherty says that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're ""taking hold of the pizza box"". ""Before you take the food out, wash your hands and then put the pizza box somewhere out of the way,"" Professor Doherty suggests in a webinar for the Australian Academy of Science. “It can certainly survive longer on plastics and steel ... in the SARS epidemic, of course, we saw people wiping down elevator buttons. […] Just open everything, wash your hands before you take the food out of the plastic and maybe transfer it to another plastic bag before you put it in the fridge."" No. The Centre for Food Safety’s guidelines say there is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. Soap or dishwashing liquid should not be used, as they can stay on food and cause sickness. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus, says Arden. You also don’t need to scrub food that you are going to later peel, such as oranges. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. “Think of your hands as the enemy,” write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden. If the virus comes into contact with your hands, and then you touch your nose, mouth or eyes, it can gain entry to your body. You must wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly before eating. - Liam Mannix We don’t need to be worried about the temperature of a wash because we use strong detergents in our washing powders, even when they are cold wash formulations, says virologist Katherine Ardern and coronavirus expert Associate Professor Ian Mackay, both at the University of Queensland. They cite a recent study, which, although not having yet been through a peer review process so not conclusive, provides an early picture of how the virus reacts in certain conditions. In a laboratory, a 30-minute incubation of the virus at 56C or a five-minute incubation at 70C rendered SARS-CoV-2 inactive. In its recommendations for households where someone is ill, or suspected of being ill with COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends laundering items ""using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items"", and drying the items completely. A similar answer applies as with washing machines. Professor Mackay notes that if you are caring for an ill person, you need to be extra vigilant in cleaning their crockery and cutlery to ensure that you limit the risk of family spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this if someone has COVID-19 in your household: ""The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items."" The NSW Health Department advises using common household disinfectant sprays for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is what is known as an “enveloped virus”, which means it is made of a little ball of fat and protein. That makes it relatively easily to kill with standard disinfectants. In Australia, disinfectants are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so if you pick the right one – look for a specific disinfectant, not a cleaner – you can be confident it works. Not all disinfectants are regulated by the same standards. Look for a specific label on the disinfectant that means it kills viruses, such as virucidal or antiviral activity. Importantly, this is different to antibacterial – antibacterial ingredients kill bacteria, not viruses. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label, which may include cleaning a surface before disinfecting it. Cleaning and disinfecting are different things. As the CDC notes, cleaning does not kill germs in itself but, by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. The Australian Department of Health advises you to target frequently touched surfaces: door handles, bed rails, table tops and light switches. As with all things COVID-19, there is still much we don’t know. The advice above is based on guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guidance from the Australian Department of Health, from the Australian Research Council Training Centre for Food Safety, and expert commentary from Associate Professor Ian Mackay (an expert on coronaviruses) and Katherine Ardern (a virologist), both at the University of Queensland. – Liam Mannix One of the big mysteries of the virus is how infectious asymptomatic people really are. Some experts say people shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, and the WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours before symptoms first appear. But other studies have tracked infections in parts of China and Singapore to “stealth” transmitters with mild or no symptoms. This also played out in the case of the cruise ship turned floating quarantine site the Diamond Princess in early February. A study found that 18 per cent of those infected on board never showed symptoms. Because this virus can spread before symptoms appear, it is especially hard to contain. ""Let's stop saying it's a bad flu,"" pleaded doctor Daniele Macchini, from the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where the virus had gained a deadly foothold. Patients inundating intensive care wards had ""far from the complications of a flu"", the doctor wrote on Facebook in March. While flu has many of the same symptoms and results in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier. In Australia, government figures for the most recent flu season ending October 2019 show 812 people died of influenza out of 298,120 reported cases – a fatality rate of about 0.27 per cent. Emerging coronaviruses such as this strain and SARS can also do more damage to the body, particularly the lungs. And the new virus is more infectious than the flu, or SARS or MERS, with one COVID-19 patient likely to infect between two and three others. Yes, it's possible. As it breeds in the lungs, the virus can impair your body's ability to filter out germs falling down from the upper airways and so leave some people susceptible to another bug – whether the common cold, influenza or a case of bacterial pneumonia. So this year there is a particular urgency behind calls for people to have their flu shots, as hospitals brace for a surge of COVID-19 and flu cases hitting all at once. On April 1, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly urged Australians, especially those aged over 65, to get their flu vaccines as soon as possible. ""As of now there are millions of vaccines out there ready,"" Professor Kelly said. That's the big question. This virus's closest relative, SARS, while deadly, spread more slowly and to far fewer countries and so early containment efforts worked to wipe it out, largely within a year. For COVID-19, many experts are instead drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available – between 12 and 18 months. The virus has now reached most of the world – more than 170 countries, and the World Health Organisation warns it is ""accelerating"". It took the virus 67 days to infect the first 100,000 people, just 11 to reach 200,000 and four to top 300,000. By mid-March in Australia, the number of cases was doubling every three to four days. In recent days, since stricter social distancing rules came into force and more people start to stay home, that growth has slowed but authorities say now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"". Outside China, major clusters of the virus have broken out in Italy, where hospitals have been pushed to the brink as well as the US, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea. Some nations, including many in Europe, have turned to the ""China model"" of forced home quarantines and transport shutdowns to stop the virus. But experts note that China, as well as countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, have also started to ""flatten their curve"" of infection growth through exhaustive testing, contact tracing of known cases and community take-up of ""social distancing"" measures such as working from home or taking schools online. China's success so far means it is already starting to relax many of its lockdowns, even as it braces for a potential second wave. In Italy and now other countries such as Spain, France and the UK, people are only allowed to leave their homes to run essential errands such as grabbing groceries (and they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Anyone caught breaking Singapore's rules can land themselves in prison after the city-state made it an offence for a person to intentionally stand close to another. The main symptoms of the new coronavirus are: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat. Nausea or diarrhea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS, and a blocked nose is less common again. The federal government has ruled people shouldn’t gather together except for “essential” activities such as school, public transport and work – but working from home is strongly encouraged and schools will move to mostly online lessons after Easter, except for students who have to attend in person. Shopping centres will stay open but food courts will be for takeaway only. People are urged to just buy what they need and not collect together or take time browsing. Those indoor gatherings still running should allow space for one person per four square metres. While the government is yet to move towards a full-scale shutdown of all but non-essential services, the following have already closed or suspended: The good news is the other thing shutting down is evictions – with a moratorium on evictions from commercial and residential rental properties as a “result of financial distress"" for the next six months. Services so far considered ""essential"" under a wider shutdown include pharmacies, fuel stations, health care, food shops and public transport and airports. Hairdressers and barbers are not on that list but can remain open for now – though they must strictly manage social distancing and the four-square-metre rule. The federal government says hotels, hostels, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be a decision for each state and territory. All non-urgent elective surgeries are postponed until further notice. Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has written to states and territories urging them to exempt telcos, postal services and media organisations from any future restrictions on movement as ""essential services"". Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses – and funerals must be capped at 10 people, in what the government has called ""very difficult"" but necessary measures. JobSeeker is a payment of $550 a fortnight (now increased to $1100 a fortnight as part of a coronavirus stimulus boost) for those who have lost their employment. JobSeeker replaced the NewStart allowance in March. However, the new JobKeeper scheme is a $1500 payment (before tax) per staff member provided to employers by the government over the next six months to help businesses hold onto workers so that after the pandemic is over they can more easily start over. Employers can only receive the subsidy if they have turnover of less than $1 billion and this figure has fallen by 30 per cent or more, or they have a turnover higher than $1 billion and this has fallen by 50 per cent or more. Employers receiving the subsidy must report to the Australian Tax Office every month. See here for details. – Jennifer Duke At least one in 10 Australians have asthma but the condition doesn’t mean you’re more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack. “It’s a double-whammy, really,” says National Asthma Council Australia chief Siobhan Brophy. Respiratory physician Peter Wark says there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how COVID-19 affects asthmatics but, from previous experience with other respiratory illnesses, they’ll likely be at higher risk of complications – as was observed during the SARS outbreak and still occurs with common illnesses such as cold and flu. The WHO and other health authorities are urging extra precautions for asthmatics. Brophy says now is the time to be on your “best behaviour”: following your asthma plan and doctor’s advice to the letter and re-filling prescriptions so your lungs are in their best shape possible should an infection come. While people without the condition have been hoarding ventolin, she notes there’s little point as the medication is designed to treat an asthma attack and not COVID-19. There has been some concern about continuing asthma medication such as steroid tablets or injections, which could suppress the body's overall immune system, Brophy says, but steroid inhalers are still fine – they only travel to the lungs and remain vital for asthmatics. “Talk to your doctor before you stop taking anything but if you’re still using an old nebuliser to take your medication, use a puffer and a spacer instead. A nebuliser will spray out particles [and possibly germs] from your lungs."" Tell your doctor about your asthma and your medication if you develop symptoms. Replay   Coronaviruses are a family of viruses causing respiratory illness mostly found in animals. Only seven have been identified in humans, including the four that commonly give us coughs and colds. But when a new strain jumps across from wildlife, such as SARS and now this new strain, it can be dangerous as there is no natural immunity to fight it off. Because it's new, at first the virus was known simply as the ""novel"" coronavirus. Then the WHO named it SARS-CoV-2, given it shares so much of its DNA – about 75 per cent – with the SARS-CoV strain behind the SARS outbreak. The illness caused by this current strain is now called COVID-19. The illness was first identified after people started falling ill at wet market reported to sell wild animals in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unfounded theories that the virus is man-made quickly began to circulate online but scientists studying its genome already agree it came from animals - as more than 70 per cent of all new diseases emerging in humans do. Wild animals packed together and then butchered in live markets throughout Asia can be incubators for viruses to evolve and jump species barriers – SARS was traced back to a colony of bats but was believed to have passed into humans again in a wet market via the Himalayan palm civet, an ancient species of mammal eaten as a delicacy in China. And MERS also has bat origins but mostly spreads from infected camels, often in slaughterhouses. Bats are essential to many ecosystems we rely on but, through a lucky quirk in their immune system, they also carry a whole host of diseases that do not harm them. Early work suggests this new virus is 96 per cent similar to a SARS-like strain already discovered in bats a few years back, but experts think it likely first jumped into another animal, possibly the highly endangered and heavily trafficked pangolin, where it gained potency before passing into humans.  The question of who should practice this social distancing (everyone) versus who should seal themselves off completely has sparked some confusion. To stem the spread of COVID-19, millions of people infected or exposed around the world are also being urged to go into voluntary exile at home or in isolation wards. While some people have chosen to start home isolation themselves, thousands of others in Australia been already been issued formal notices to comply as states call in police to help enforce them. We dive into the rules in this explainer here but in brief: if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, then you must self-isolate for a full fortnight (the estimated period of virus incubation before symptoms appear). If you are self-isolating at home, your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food rather than going out, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch out for are a high fever and shortness of breath). If you are infected yourself or awaiting tests, then everyone should stay home. You can still wander into your garden or balcony but, while some officials have said you can walk the dog or stretch your legs, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says you must stay home if you've been told to self-isolate: ""Sorry."" Despite these rules, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said, on March 27, that Australia was still seeing large numbers of returned travellers with the virus and, in many cases, passing it on to their families. “More than two-thirds are returned travellers, and a significant proportion of the other cases have been transmitted from returned travellers,” he said. From March 29, all overseas arrivals are being escorted from airports into hotels and other accommodation for the 14-day window, at the government's expense. The army has been called in alongside police to enforce these quarantines after a number of people were caught out of their homes breaking self-isolation orders. Only if you really have to. Our borders have closed and overseas travel is now banned under biosecurity powers, except in exceptional circumstances. Citizens still travelling abroad are urged to come home as countries impose similar shutdowns of their own. Starting with Tasmania, most states have also started to close their domestic borders - police patrols will now ask people crossing over to go into quarantine for the recommended 14-day window. At this early stage, we are still not absolutely sure how the virus affects women and babies. Different governments have offered different advice.For now, let’s stick to what Australia’s peak body, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZOG), has to say. Note these guidelines are changing regularly and you should check back on their website for the most up-to-date advice. According to guidelines, at this stage it does not appear that pregnant women are at greater risk from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - like they were during the world's last pandemic Swine Flu in 2009.  However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. There is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or birth abnormalities, nor is there evidence the virus can pass from woman to unborn child or via breastmilk. “The safest place to birth your baby is in a hospital, where you have access to highly trained staff and emergency facilities,” the guidelines state. If the mother is infected at the time of birth, she should not be separated from her newborn, but should wear a mask and take precautions. The health advice is the same for pregnant women as it is for everyone else: work from home, avoid public places, and nail your hand hygiene. The RANZCOG guidelines suggest visitors in hospital are limited only to the immediate partner. But this is just a suggestion – different hospitals will have different rules. No. Public transport is still running as it is considered one of the essential activities exempt from the government's ban on gatherings but cleaning has been ramped up. While calls are growing from some experts to shut down public transport already, many people rely on it. Still, as social distancing rules come into force, travellers are deserting normally packed routes in droves. When on public transport, health officials say you should allow room for others as much as possible, rather than crowding in. It's also important to keep an eye on what you've been touching. If you then touch your face, a virus surviving on, say, a metal handrail could jump across – so carry a disinfectant or even wear one (stylish) glove for holding on and touching things. It appears that, as with SARS, it's possible for our pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about a pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a ""weak positive"" test for COVID-19, the WHO stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people, and no one should abandon their animals. Hong Kong authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners. (And the recent case of a tiger with another mild case in New York's Bronx Zoo has been linked to a sick staff member). The risk instead would come in if a pet itself became a contaminated ""surface"" (from all those sloppy kisses). You should exercise the usual cautions around animals, washing your hands after touching them. The most hopeful estimates fall within the range of 12 to 18 months. A report for the British government put it at “potentially 18 months or more”. Why? Because making a vaccine is really, really hard. To make a vaccine, you first need to design a way of giving a human immunity against a virus. Then you need to make sure the vaccine is not toxic. Then you need to test it in animals. Then you need to test it in humans – and the tests need to be large so we can make sure it works and is safe. And then you need to make the billions of doses needed. And there is every chance a vaccine that looks promising in the lab, or in animal tests, won’t work in humans. Experts are hoping to roll out a safe vaccine within 18 months. But even that would be unprecedented. No vaccine has ever been developed that quickly. - Liam Mannix, science reporter The Peter Doherty Institute in Australia is working on both a vaccine and a potential therapeutic treatment for the virus, and director Sharon Lewin says the latter might offer a faster fix. A drug that could block the virus from replicating in the body (or calm down the body's intense immune response to it) could keep patients with severe infections alive and, in the case of an antiviral, reduce transmission. Several existing drugs are now being trialled against the new virus worldwide, including those used to treat HIV, malaria, and arthritis. The results look promising but it's not time to rush out to the pharmacy just yet. It took this new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first thousand people. By contrast, SARS took 130 days and the less infectious MERS more than two years to infect a thousand people after it emerged in 2012. When SARS finished its spread after nine months in 2003, only 8098 cases had been confirmed across 26 countries but close to 10 per cent of those were fatal. (Most clusters happened in hospitals or households.) MERS has been circulating for eight years across 27 countries so far, and kills about a third of those who fall ill – out of about 2500 confirmed cases. Ebola is even more deadly, killing more than 40 per cent of those diagnosed over a number of outbreaks since the 1970s but it has been reported in just a handful of countries. In the pandemic records, the infamous 1918 Spanish flu killed about 2.5 per cent of its victims over two years – but because it infected so many people (close to 27 per cent of the world's population) at a time of much cruder medical care, about 50 million died. Today, doctors are much better able to stave off secondary bacterial infections, which proved particularly deadly during that outbreak. And, unlike the Spanish flu, young people are not dying at the same high rates. The last pandemic was swine flu in 2009, the second coming of a H1N1 influenza that infected between 11 and 21 per cent of the world's population. Governments mounted costly responses until it was ruled to be over in October 2010. But the virus killed about 285,000 people (fewer than seasonal flu normally does) with a relatively low fatality rate of .02 per cent, and the WHO copped criticism for labelling it a pandemic at all.

And, in a bid to stop companies cutting jobs, employees of eligible businesses can claim a new $1500 fortnightly 'Jobkeeper' payment, even some who have already been let go so long as they were with the company on March 1. Businesses and not-for-profits that have experienced more than a 30 per cent downturn in revenue are eligible and payments will be delivered in May but backdated to March. The federal government estimates about half of the workforce - or six million people - will get this payment over the next six months.

Your COVID-19 questions answered,"Since it emerged in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has infected more than 1.5 million people and claimed 80,000 lives. To stop a pandemic that spreads from person to person in close quarters, the world has largely shut down, with borders closed, streets empty and whole cities going into quarantine. Australia has its own strict measures to avoid the terrible scenes playing out in places such as Italy and the United States, where hospital systems are now being overwhelmed. We are told to live our lives further apart – literally – by avoiding gatherings, staying home and keeping 1.5 metres clear of each other.  As we learn more about this virus, questions from you, our readers, are flooding in. Our explainer team, as well as our health, science and data reporters, will answer as many of them as we can. And when new information comes to light, we'll bring you updates too – with the latest featured up top in this story. Here's what we know so far. While scientists agree the virus is not airborne in the same way as other infectious diseases such as measles, they are split on the question of how big a risk it poses in the air. The World Health Organisation says there’s not enough evidence to say the virus can jump from person to person in small or aerosolised particles. It’s mostly shed by larger water droplets from the nose and mouth, tiny balls of mucus, salt and virus that can shoot out up to about a metre when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Sometimes they land on and contaminate surfaces, but they’re too heavy to survive long in the air. A growing number of scientists, including infectious disease expert Professor Raina MacIntyre and aerosol scientist and WHO advisor Professor Lidia Morawska, now say the risk may have been underestimated. As an Australian Department of Health spokeswoman also noted, viruses do not always fall neatly into either aerosol or droplet (which are classed as anything more than five microns in size). They can leave the body as both. It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s, they only travel a metre. But we know more now.   “It’s old medical dogma from the 1930s that they only travel a metre,” Professor Morawska said. “But we know more now. We've already shown other viruses like the flu [that mostly] shed in droplets can also spread from breathing. [In a] pandemic, we need to assume the worst."" That still doesn't mean you'll catch the virus from passing someone on the street ""unless they coughed right in your face"", Professor Morawska says. Like cigarette smoke, the virus will disperse in open spaces. And, just like smoke, it can build up in enclosed areas without ventilation. ""We don’t know how much you would have to inhale to get infected, the smaller particles at least carry less virus, but it’s possible,"" she said. Professor Morawska, who heads up the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health at Queensland University of Technology,  is now working with scientists from around the world to write enhanced guidelines for potential aerosol transmission. On April 9, the Department of Health said COVID-19 was ""not as efficient"" at spreading in the air as other diseases considered to be airborne - a greater risk was posed by the ""underestimated"" spread of COVID-19 through touching contaminated surfaces. Other experts such as infectious disease physician Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake say the virus is unlikely to be spreading frequently in the air, even if it's possible. If it were, the shape of the pandemic would be likely look different - more infectious and striking down more people without close contact to known cases. On paper, early studies into the new virus show mixed results – some found it in the air of hospitals treating patients, some didn’t. Even if the virus stays airborne, that doesn’t necessarily mean it stays infectious, Professor Morawska notes, as all viruses start to die once they leave the body. The warmer the conditions, the faster they tend to break up. One laboratory study by scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detected the virus in the air for up to three hours but the WHO has since pointed out that it did not reflect real-world conditions. Still, America’s National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine wrote to the White House earlier in April saying the current research supports the possibility that COVID-19 can be spread by aerosols from breathing, as was observed to a small degree during the first dangerous coronavirus outbreak, SARS. But back then in 2003, Associate Professor Senanayake notes the virus generally aerosolised in hospitals where treatments such as intubation and ventilation increase the risk. The WHO itself has issued warnings to healthcare workers that this may happen again and many wards treating COVID-19 operate as if the infection is airborne, including in Australia.  ""We're all following that really closely and it seems to be holding up well,"" Associate Professor Senanyake said. Face masks can protect against the droplets that spread the virus and are now a common sight on the streets of many cities around the world such as Hong Kong. Both the WHO and the Australian government say masks are still only necessary for people with symptoms and those treating them, and must not be wasted by the general public as shortages of the product could put healthcare workers at risk. All the same, calls are growing in many Western countries for a wider take-up of face masks to slow outbreaks. In the US, the CDC has already reversed its own advice, now urging people to wear cloth masks whenever they are somewhere poorly ventilated or can’t keep their distance from others, such as a supermarket aisle. Its guidance to healthcare workers also states that, while the extent of aerosol transmission is still unclear, the virus can spread when someone ""coughs, sneezes or talks"". Professor Morawska agrees with the move, saying masks aren't needed outdoors but are a good idea where ventilation is poor. But Professor MacIntyre and Associate Professor Senanayake say they are not as necessary in Australia as in places such as New York, where community transmission is now rampant. It’s also unclear how much home-made masks or bandannas and scarves will block virus-laden droplets. Some experts warn widespread use of DIY masks could leave people with a false sense of security - and an urge to touch (and so possibly contaminate) their face more often as they adjust them. Australian health authorities have indicated they are reviewing their own advice on masks, as they do all their guidelines, but stress it still stands. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has urged people not to ""waste"" masks and notes they should be handled carefully and changed regularly (Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty recommends sterilising used masks rather than throwing them away, given the shortage).   Right now, health authorities say anyone who spends more than two hours in an enclosed room with an infected person has been exposed to the virus. But Professor Morawska warns there needs to be more focus on the need to opt for natural ventilation by throwing windows open wherever possible rather than using air circulation systems. Associate Professor Senanayake says air conditioning and heating could still be considered safe in most settings as droplets will not travel that far. And the Department of Health agreed that, while there was not enough data on the question, the risk from ventilation was low outside healthcare settings. NSW Health said air conditioners and heating were safe to use even when people in the home had COVID-19. ""What is important for suspected and confirmed cases is to try and stay in a room separate to the rest of their family and if possible, use a different bathroom...to avoid the spread of COVID-19 through droplets...and surface contamination,"" a spokeswoman said. ""It is only in the very sickest patients, who are in our specialist ICUs, or patients who require hospital treatments like intubation, where we are likely to see the virus be airborne."" Yes. Some people will be infected without symptoms or very mild symptoms. To test for COVID-19 right now, clinicians need to either take a direct sample of the virus, from a throat or nose swab or in lung phlegm, and examine its genetic code. Those tests are considered very accurate but in some cases if they miss the virus – say, because it is further down in the lungs and someone doesn’t cough up any phlegm (or sputum) – they can return a false negative. That’s why tests are often repeated, especially for patients recovering and returning to the community. Blood tests, which look for the body’s immune response to the infection, can also be used but are not yet widely available outside China, and bring their own false negative risks – antibodies deployed by the body to fight off the virus can take more than a week to form so may not show up if the test is performed too early into the illness. This is also true of the rapid finger-prick tests being checked in Australia right now by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, after problems overseas. A government spokesman said these are therefore not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA sample or PCR test and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. Scientists aren’t sure yet but they think it most likely. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with those aforementioned antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (though not always a life-long shield). Many experts say reports of people appearing to catch this new virus twice are probably best explained by false negative tests clearing them of the infection too early (when the virus had actually remained in their system) rather than catching it a second time. Associate Professor Senanayake says the virus collected by the later tests may even be dead. Common coronaviruses such as the ones that give you a cold tend to go away for at least a year or so before we become susceptible again. Studies of MERS-CoV has found antibodies still present in survivors more than 18 months after recovery, and some survivors of SARS retained antibodies for many years thereafter. Countries that have ""flattened their curve"" and dramatically slowed outbreaks have carried out exhaustive testing and contact tracing. In many cases, people without symptoms are tested and health officials actively hunt for others, checking temperatures on entry to buildings. Australia's testing rates are proportionately high compared to many other countries (more than 300,000 have been done so far) but the criteria for being tested is still fairly strict due to a global shortage of testing kits, the government says. Amid increasing calls from the WHO to ""test all suspected cases"", Australia has since ramped up the operation to 10,000 tests a day and expanded that criteria, meaning frontline staff with symptoms can now qualify too. Sample testing of people with symptoms who have not been overseas or exposed to a known case has also started in areas identified as at risk of community transmission, such as Sydney. Some states are taking matters into their own hands. On April 6, the ACT began random sample testing of those with symptoms but no other risk factors as did Queensland in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast. That followed news that Victoria would expand testing to people aged over 65, Indigenous Australians, cruise-ship passengers, people in high-risk settings such as prisons, schools, childcare and homelessness and disability support as well as police and firefighters. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says he supports more widespread testing but stresses there is still a ""temporary"" shortage of testing kits. Faster finger prick tests that tell if someone has antibodies against the virus (and so has it or has fought it off) in their blood are also being checked by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. But a government spokesman said these are not considered a good substitute for the standard DNA test because such antibodies can take between five and seven days of infection to develop and ""faulty devices"" can also lead to false negatives. The spokesman did not give a timeline of Australia's work to fix the testing-kit shortage but said it was ""working with public and private laboratories and with pathology suppliers to understand both international and domestic supply capacity and capability and are exploring the possibility of building further domestic capability to produce tests and reagents for COVID-19"". They also did not answer questions on how kits are being distributed to the states, as some push ahead with their own expanded testing. Australia has one of the lowest positive rates for testing in the world, Professor Murphy says, meaning authorities feel ""reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of cases in Australia and that means we can get on top of cases"" through contact tracing. That's in contrast to countries such as Iran, Italy and even the US, where Australian authorities say they likely only tested the more severe cases or, as Murphy puts it, ""when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in community that were undetected"". Still, at times Australian authorities have also faced criticism for letting contacts of cases slip through the net, most notably allowing 2700 passengers to disembark in Sydney from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, hundreds of whom later tested positive. But the states have also threatened hefty fines and even jail time for those at risk of spreading the virus who break home quarantine orders. Anyone following the international news on the pandemic will have noticed a marked variation in death rates from Covid-19 among different countries. In hard-hit Italy, for instance, the death rate among confirmed cases is around 12 per cent in the first week of April, compared with 1.75 per cent in Germany and – thus far – less than 1 per cent here. East Asian countries have generally done better, the UK, Spain and the US worse. A number of factors help account for this variation. The most significant is that the death rate will largely reflect how widely you are testing, and the age groups you test in. If, as in Germany, you test a very large number of people, many of whom are young with mild symptoms, you get a lower rate of death overall. If, as in the UK and US, you only test those who are very ill and in hospital, the converse applies: your death rate looks much higher. Per head of population, Australia’s testing regime has been ahead of many other countries. Other factors that contribute to varying death rates include: demographics such as the age profile of a country’s population overall; density of living conditions; patterns of interaction between different generations; cultural factors (such as the absence of social kissing and handshaking in Japan); and, importantly, the capacity of health systems to cope with the very ill. Germany has more than double Italy’s number of acute care beds per 100,000 people, and more than triple the UK’s acute bed capacity. In Italy, with one of the oldest populations in Europe, researchers believe that deeply ingrained habits of adult children living with, or remaining housed close to, their parents has contributed to the high fatality rate there. Younger adults, commuting into larger employment centres where the virus had been silently spreading, bring the virus back to the smaller communities where their parents live. Smoking rates may be a factor in some places. The jury is out on whether seasonality (whether a country is going into warmer or cooler weather) plays a role. – Deborah Snow No matter where you live, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised that there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Here's the boiled-down version texted to thousands of Australians: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care."" Whenever you go out you must stick with just those in your household or up to one other external person, and you should keep your distance from others (about two steps or 1.5 metres). Wash or sanitise your hands regularly and ditch the handshake and the kiss hello. In enforcing these rules, authorities are emphasising a ""common sense"" approach. As NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says: ""If you're questioning whether you should be doing something, best to give it a miss."" We put a list of your questions to governments and are including the answers below, as we get them, and in more detail in this dedicated explainer here. On April 3, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""Doesn't matter what temperature it is, if it's a warm day, don't go in masses down to the beach."" The key word here is masses. No state has outlawed a trip to the beach (or the park) but they are urging people to reconsider whether the visit is necessary and warn new rules against gatherings may be enforced. Queensland police have closed some beaches, discouraged people from travelling long distances to them. Victoria also advises people to ""keep visits short and maintain physical distancing at all times"". A walk or a quick swim is ok, sunbaking probably not.  You can still hop in the car on your way to exercise but all states advise limiting travel. In Victoria, a government spokeswoman said on April 1, you should only drive in cars with people you live with, but advice since released says you can still use taxis and other ride-share services for ""permitted purposes"". WA advises sitting in the back if getting a taxi or an Uber and Tasmania also encourages people to extend physical distancing to car travel. ""Travelling in cars is not restricted ... non-essential travel is,"" a Tasmanian government spokeswoman said. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told ABC Radio people should not be going anywhere just for a drive, even if they had no intentions of getting out of the car. ""It is not a reasonable excuse,"" he said. ""If you don't really need to do it, then stay home and stay safe."" Not all states answered questions on whether learner drivers could still go out for driving practice but in Victoria, learner driving lessons should only be part of essential travel, such as to the supermarket.But NSW Police have ruled that learner driver lessons can continue – for an instructor it could be considered work that cannot be done from home and for the learner it is ""akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Family members can also take learners out for a lesson or for other essential travel. See more here. It depends on the circumstances – and again on what state you live in. The question of romantic partners who don't cohabit initially caused particular consternation when NSW and Victoria both ruled out social visits under their new emergency powers. You can still visit someone's house to care for them, drop off supplies or in an emergency – say, if you are fleeing danger, but in Victoria Police Minister Lisa Neville said on March 31 ""you cannot visit your partner for social reasons"". On the morning of April 1, a Victorian health department spokeswoman added: ""You shouldn't be physically intimate with people you're not living with, even if they are your partner."" But, later in the day, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton announced the rules around romantic partners – which by then had become known as the ""bonk ban"" – would be relaxed with a new exemption for couples. In NSW, Police Commissioner Mick Fuller made a similar exemption, saying you can still visit your partner as it falls under the category of ""care"". ""Mental health, we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you"". Meanwhile, jurisdictions such as Tasmania and the ACT still let you have up to two visitors over to your home at one time as long as you are following social distancing measures – no hugging or kissing, and allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In Queensland,you can have two visitors to each household - but no strangers are allowed over. In all states, tradesman, cleaners, even removalists are allowed if you really need them or may fall under caring but physical distancing must be maintained. – with Lydia Lynch While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear, although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. Victoria has since clarified its own rules to allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. But older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia’s chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  - with Noel Towell Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"" as new data shows tough new social distancing measures are slowing down the virus' spread in Australia. All states have issued similiar advice, warning a migration to the coast could spread the virus further and put dangerous strain on regional health resources. But not all are fining people for ducking down to the holiday house. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said police don't have the resources to enforce the advice over the upcoming Easter weekend but stressed ""this is not a holiday weekend, we can't have a normal Easter"" and state Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says if you've booked a holiday you should cancel it. Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton had earlier said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them as a household. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for supplies; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. Camping or setting up a caravan somewhere is out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental either. Airbnb now have cancellation policies in place to get a full refund if you booked before March 14. NSW says people shouldn't go on holidays or use Airbnb unless it's for an essential reason such as work and police have revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. See more here.  In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, “Easter holidays are cancelled this year”. Queensland police have flagged they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. - with Stuart Layt, Tammy Mills, Michael Evans, Hannah Barry, Michael Fowler If you have to. You can even have removalists provided you adhere to physical distancing rules. The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow its infection rate by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing As the world waits for a vaccine, this will save lives by helping stop a surge of cases overwhelming emergency departments all at once. Along with measures such as lockdowns and tracing and isolating cases, social distancing has worked against outbreaks in the past, including the Spanish Flu of 1918. The recent surge in Australian cases has started to slow a little in recent days as new rules come into force. But if people do not follow them, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy warns that Australia could lose its window to contain the outbreak – and cases could rapidly explode. . The federal government has stopped tracking recovery numbers in Australia, drawing criticism from some experts who say it is an important measure of any outbreak. Amid a shortage of testing kits, an Australian government spokesman confirmed only healthcare and aged care workers returning to the frontline must be ""cleared"" with testing (two negative tests) under the national guidelines. Local health authorities keep a close eye on all confirmed cases on the virus and others may still be retested. But most, such as those recovering in home isolation, only have to meet the following conditions: The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention advises the same 72-hour window of time after symptoms disappear but some studies overseas have shown the virus can live in the body for weeks after. The Australian government spokesman said ""a small proportion of people may have an illness that has completely resolved but their [tests] remain persistently positive"". There a decision on release from isolation will be made on a case-by-case basis after consulting their doctor, the testing lab and the public health unit. The 72-hour rule was decided by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which advises Health Minister Greg Hunt, as ""a precautionary period to manage uncertainty around how long a confirmed case remains infectious post-symptom resolution"", the spokesman said. ""Even in these patients there is uncertainty around whether there is a direct correlation of persistent [positive tests] and infectivity, but what we know from other virus infection, it is not a neat correlation,"" he said. ""There have been case reports of patients testing positive for a couple of weeks post-symptom resolution, but are viral culture negative meaning they are unlikely infectious for very long after symptoms resolve."" Wash your hands after holding your cup. ""It's all about interrupting the chance of self-inoculation,"" says Associate Professor Ian Mackay, an expert on coronaviruses, at the University of Queensland. The virus has been found to last for shorter periods on card and paper than some other surfaces but it can persist, according to lab studies. ""Whether there is ever likely to be enough virus on that surface to infect another person remains an unanswered question,"" says Professor Mackay. ""The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus.""    Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science – people may be diagnosed or succumb to the illness further down the line. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the WHO estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV, which also caused global panic when it exploded onto the scene in late 2002, and MERS-CoV, which causes a condition more deadly again known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). On the raw figures so far, more than 1.4 million people have been infected worldwide and at least 81,000 have died. About 298,000 have already ""officially"" recovered. The case of the Diamond Princess outbreak has so far offered one of the most stable data sets from which to make calculations- analysis of deaths and infections there put the overall fatality rate at just below 1 per cent. Data out of China found most people (about 80 per cent) recovered from the new virus on their own, even if they developed pneumonia. But about one in five needed more serious medical intervention (such as ventilation to help them breathe) and, of those, 6 per cent were pushed into critical care – as multiple organs began to fail along with the lungs, or septic shock (whole-body infection) set in. Anyone can catch the virus – but people most at risk of complications are older or have other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease, making their bodies may be less able to cope with the extra strain. Smokers are also more likely to develop a nasty infection, as the virus breeds via cell receptors in the lungs known to increase with cigarette smoke. Experts say the higher the dose of virus you are hit with, the faster you will show symptoms and the more dangerous it can be for your immune system to fight off. For example, catching the virus from a doorknob is likely to give you a smaller dose than caring for an infected person without protective clothing such as a mask. For more on how the new virus affects the body and what it feels like to get it, you can read this explainer here. Difficulty breathing is the main reason that people with COVID-19 present to a hospital, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. The virus, which attacks the lungs, can progress quite quickly, worsening beyond shortness of breath. Once admitted to a ward and receiving oxygen via a mask, a person’s condition may improve – but other people will need increasing amounts of support to keep their lungs sending oxygen throughout their body. ""That’s where intensive care would step in,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “If it’s bad enough that you need to be put on a breathing machine then you would definitely be in intensive care. If there was a sense that a patient was deteriorating towards needing a ventilator or a life-support machine, we’d also put them in intensive care. What intensive care is able to offer is the medical specialists and more monitoring … It's very intense – not surprisingly, given the name.” Without a drug that is definitively proven to halt or even slow COVID-19 at this stage, the aim is to support patients until they recover. “We wait for the virus to clear up and then the lungs will often repair themselves if we can wait and just support them while they do that. So you might have a period of, say, a week on a life-support machine where the virus starts to clear itself and the lungs start to improve and then we take the breathing machine away.” Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down. But, as experience has shown worldwide, the outcome is not always positive. “Keeping people in a sort of induced sleep, the energy demands of their body go right down,” says Dr Mcgloughin. “They’re not using as much oxygen as they would normally. The problem with that is it works quite well and it’s a really effective therapy but, obviously, being in that state puts the body in quite a vulnerable position.” There are two problems that can arise, he says. One is that the infection itself can affect the other organs. And there is “just the stress of being so sick”. “We're supposed to be up and walking around but when you’re in intensive care your body is a little bit vulnerable to either getting another infection from bacteria, or the virus itself affecting your other organs. That’s why there is a difference, unfortunately, that people who are a little bit older or those a bit more vulnerable beforehand don’t do as well as people that are younger.” Dr Mcgloughin, who chaired the group that wrote the COVID-19 guidelines for The Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, says Australian hospitals are benefiting from the advice of colleagues overseas, including in Italy and Singapore, both about treatments and how to protect themselves. “Within weeks of what happened in Italy, they had already published very detailed summaries of what happened. I’m amazed the guys were able to do that.” So what would he say to younger people, including those aged 20-29 who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in NSW and Victoria more than any other age group? “Stay home. Do what the government’s asking us to do. Let’s do that for a week or a few months. You’re doing it potentially to protect yourself – it’s not impossible that young people get sick – but you’re really doing it to protect the older people in our community. To me, it’s a real social responsibility. It’s sort of a good test of Australians' ability to look after each other, really. You know, we all like to think we do that – but this is probably the chance to prove it.” Anyone who’s had a general anaesthetic will have relied on a ventilator, whether they know it or not. It happens between the bit where you start to feel drowsy – ”you stop breathing and then I put in a breathing tube and put you on to a breathing machine,” says Dr Suzi Nou, president of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists – and the bit where you wake up in the recovery room. That breathing machine is a ventilator, pushing oxygen into your body. “For healthy patients undergoing routine surgery, [when] I stop giving them anaesthetic, they start breathing for themselves,” says Dr Nou. Treating patients with COVID-19, whose lungs are compromised by the disease, is another story. “They’re too unwell to do the job of breathing for themselves. We’d induce the state of sleepiness, put a breathing tube in and put them on the ventilator.” While a patient having routine surgery will rely on a ventilator for minutes or hours – and it’s not uncommon for a patient in intensive care to rely on one for four or five days – a patient with COVID-19 might need one for as long as 10 days. This is why ventilators have become such a precious commodity worldwide since the pandemic took hold, prompting a doctor in the hard-hit Italian region of Lombardy to say they had become as precious as gold. There are plans for the number of ventilators (and intensive care beds to go with them) in Australia to be doubled to 4000 while more have been freed up by the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery and still more are now being manufactured in Australia.   But behind every ventilator is a team of experts too, such as Dr Nou and highly trained nurses. In Australia, every patient on a ventilator has a dedicated nurse. It's these professionals who need to be supported to keep coming to work in the coming weeks and months, says the head of the Alfred Hospital’s intensive care unit, Associate Professor Steve Mcgloughin. ""Everyone is very focused on the machines,"" he says, ""but the most valuable resource we have in healthcare is the people."" Symptoms tend to clear up in just a week or two in mild cases or three to six for more serious, according to WHO data. But early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer in some cases. Australian researchers have now mapped the body's immune response, identifying the antibodies it recruits to defeat the new virus, in some people starting the fight within just three days of the initial infection. Experts say it’s too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients. The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home ""where practicable"", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. If you fall into these categories, this measure is designed to protect you, not keep you a prisoner at home. You can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or even the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have also been restricted to protect vulnerable elderly residents. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says Australians weighing up whether to bring elderly relatives home to care for them now face a difficult ""trade-off"". On the one hand, Professor Kelly says ""the most frail, elderly people requiring, for example, a lot of home care ... may be best to shelter with relatives"". But if other family members are going ""out into the world ... and interacting with others"", they risk bringing the virus into the home. The answer isn't always clear-cut and will come down to personal circumstances. While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show concerningly high hospitalisation rates among the under 60s and in Australia there are people under 50 already in need of intensive care. And note this: there have now been more coronavirus cases in both NSW and Victoria among 25- to 29 year-olds than any other age group. In any case, even if you're young and get a milder case you can still spread the virus to someone who might not be so lucky. Aren't you the optimist? The new rules spell the end of the backyard barbecue or the extended family dinner – at least for now. House parties might even become an offence in some states. But experts say these tough temporary measures reflect just how easily the virus can spread. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has warned of a dinner party where one person was infected with COVID-19 – at the start of the night. ""By the end of the dinner party, almost everybody [there] had the coronavirus – this spreads rapidly,"" he said. Children on school holidays should not have friends over nor hang around shopping centres together, Mr Andrews has said, and it's not a case of moving beers at the pub to the living room. “We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds. That will mean they will die. We’ve got to buy time.” The first NSW COVID-19 cases were reported in Burwood, Parramatta, Randwick and Ku-Ring-Gai in late January. Clusters of cases began appearing in Ryde, Parramatta, Hornsby and central Sydney in mid-March. The virus began to spread outside Sydney on March 5, with early cases in Goulburn, the Mid-Coast and Orange. It has since spread up and down the state's east coast and in regional areas inland. By the end of March, the biggest clusters – in Waverley, the Northern Beaches and Sydney – had more than 100 cases each. More than 100 cases were linked to three cruise ships, including the Ruby Princess, which docked at Circular Quay in late March. On April 1, a pop-up testing clinic opened in Bondi, in the local government area of Waverley, which has the highest number of confirmed cases and the highest number of those with an unknown source of infection. In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers of cases have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne. A woman infected with COVID-19 on a ski holiday in the US attended a 21st birthday party in wealthy inner-east Malvern, and at least six guests contracted the virus. On April 1, the Stonnington local government area, which encompasses Malvern, had the highest number of confirmed cases with 77. In recent days there have been cases among retail workers, such as a Coles and K-Mart outlet in Melbourne's east. Hospitals have also been the site of smaller clusters and, as it stands at the moment, about 10 per cent of Victoria's confirmed coronavirus diagnoses have been in healthcare workers. Viruses need hosts to survive – they can't make it on their own. So far, the best evidence we have on how long the virus lasts on surfaces comes from a letter to the editor by a team of American scientists published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one of the world’s top medical journals. The data is still early stage and needs to be interpreted with caution. They placed samples of SARS-CoV-2 on plastic, stainless steel, cardboard and copper and tracked what happened to the virus. The virus was the most stable on plastic and stainless steel and could be detected up to 72 hours later. On absorbent surfaces such as cardboard, fabric or paper it degrades much faster. However, the amount of the virus fell quickly over time. On plastic, for example, it halved in about seven hours. That indicates these surfaces do not remain infectious forever. The overarching rule here is simple: wash your hands before you touch your face if you have come into contact with something that is likely to have been contaminated with virus. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus. Using a card is “probably lower risk”, write Professor Ian Mackay and Dr Katherine Arden on The Conversation, because you keep the card and don’t have to touch other people. In fact, using ""tap and pay"" is a social distancing practice recommended by the federal government. - with Liam Mannix You can still order in food but authorities say you shouldn't let the courier into your home and, if in an apartment, you should pick up the order outside rather than inviting them through a security door into a communal area. Professor Doherty says that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're ""taking hold of the pizza box"". ""Before you take the food out, wash your hands and then put the pizza box somewhere out of the way,"" Professor Doherty suggests in a webinar for the Australian Academy of Science. “It can certainly survive longer on plastics and steel ... in the SARS epidemic, of course, we saw people wiping down elevator buttons. […] Just open everything, wash your hands before you take the food out of the plastic and maybe transfer it to another plastic bag before you put it in the fridge."" No. The Centre for Food Safety’s guidelines say there is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. Soap or dishwashing liquid should not be used, as they can stay on food and cause sickness. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus, says Arden. You also don’t need to scrub food that you are going to later peel, such as oranges. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. “Think of your hands as the enemy,” write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden. If the virus comes into contact with your hands, and then you touch your nose, mouth or eyes, it can gain entry to your body. You must wash your hands with soap and water thoroughly before eating. - Liam Mannix We don’t need to be worried about the temperature of a wash because we use strong detergents in our washing powders, even when they are cold wash formulations, says virologist Katherine Ardern and coronavirus expert Associate Professor Ian Mackay, both at the University of Queensland. They cite a recent study, which, although not having yet been through a peer review process so not conclusive, provides an early picture of how the virus reacts in certain conditions. In a laboratory, a 30-minute incubation of the virus at 56C or a five-minute incubation at 70C rendered SARS-CoV-2 inactive. In its recommendations for households where someone is ill, or suspected of being ill with COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends laundering items ""using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items"", and drying the items completely. A similar answer applies as with washing machines. Professor Mackay notes that if you are caring for an ill person, you need to be extra vigilant in cleaning their crockery and cutlery to ensure that you limit the risk of family spread. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this if someone has COVID-19 in your household: ""The ill person should eat/be fed in their room if possible. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with hot water or in a dishwasher. Clean hands after handling used food service items."" The NSW Health Department advises using common household disinfectant sprays for surfaces. SARS-CoV-2 is what is known as an “enveloped virus”, which means it is made of a little ball of fat and protein. That makes it relatively easily to kill with standard disinfectants. In Australia, disinfectants are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, so if you pick the right one – look for a specific disinfectant, not a cleaner – you can be confident it works. Not all disinfectants are regulated by the same standards. Look for a specific label on the disinfectant that means it kills viruses, such as virucidal or antiviral activity. Importantly, this is different to antibacterial – antibacterial ingredients kill bacteria, not viruses. Make sure you follow the instructions on the label, which may include cleaning a surface before disinfecting it. Cleaning and disinfecting are different things. As the CDC notes, cleaning does not kill germs in itself but, by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. The Australian Department of Health advises you to target frequently touched surfaces: door handles, bed rails, table tops and light switches. As with all things COVID-19, there is still much we don’t know. The advice above is based on guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, guidance from the Australian Department of Health, from the Australian Research Council Training Centre for Food Safety, and expert commentary from Associate Professor Ian Mackay (an expert on coronaviruses) and Katherine Ardern (a virologist), both at the University of Queensland. – Liam Mannix One of the big mysteries of the virus is how infectious asymptomatic people really are. Some experts say people shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, and the WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours before symptoms first appear. But other studies have tracked infections in parts of China and Singapore to “stealth” transmitters with mild or no symptoms. This also played out in the case of the cruise ship turned floating quarantine site the Diamond Princess in early February. A study found that 18 per cent of those infected on board never showed symptoms. Because this virus can spread before symptoms appear, it is especially hard to contain. ""Let's stop saying it's a bad flu,"" pleaded doctor Daniele Macchini, from the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where the virus had gained a deadly foothold. Patients inundating intensive care wards had ""far from the complications of a flu"", the doctor wrote on Facebook in March. While flu has many of the same symptoms and results in tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year, COVID-19 is more than 10 times deadlier. In Australia, government figures for the most recent flu season ending October 2019 show 812 people died of influenza out of 298,120 reported cases – a fatality rate of about 0.27 per cent. Emerging coronaviruses such as this strain and SARS can also do more damage to the body, particularly the lungs. And the new virus is more infectious than the flu, or SARS or MERS, with one COVID-19 patient likely to infect between two and three others. Yes, it's possible. As it breeds in the lungs, the virus can impair your body's ability to filter out germs falling down from the upper airways and so leave some people susceptible to another bug – whether the common cold, influenza or a case of bacterial pneumonia. So this year there is a particular urgency behind calls for people to have their flu shots, as hospitals brace for a surge of COVID-19 and flu cases hitting all at once. On April 1, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly urged Australians, especially those aged over 65, to get their flu vaccines as soon as possible. ""As of now there are millions of vaccines out there ready,"" Professor Kelly said. That's the big question. This virus's closest relative, SARS, while deadly, spread more slowly and to far fewer countries and so early containment efforts worked to wipe it out, largely within a year. For COVID-19, many experts are instead drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available – between 12 and 18 months. The virus has now reached most of the world – more than 170 countries, and the World Health Organisation warns it is ""accelerating"". It took the virus 67 days to infect the first 100,000 people, just 11 to reach 200,000 and four to top 300,000. By mid-March in Australia, the number of cases was doubling every three to four days. In recent days, since stricter social distancing rules came into force and more people start to stay home, that growth has slowed but authorities say now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"". Outside China, major clusters of the virus have broken out in Italy, where hospitals have been pushed to the brink as well as the US, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea. Some nations, including many in Europe, have turned to the ""China model"" of forced home quarantines and transport shutdowns to stop the virus. But experts note that China, as well as countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, have also started to ""flatten their curve"" of infection growth through exhaustive testing, contact tracing of known cases and community take-up of ""social distancing"" measures such as working from home or taking schools online. China's success so far means it is already starting to relax many of its lockdowns, even as it braces for a potential second wave. In Italy and now other countries such as Spain, France and the UK, people are only allowed to leave their homes to run essential errands such as grabbing groceries (and they must queue 1.5 metres apart). Anyone caught breaking Singapore's rules can land themselves in prison after the city-state made it an offence for a person to intentionally stand close to another. The main symptoms of the new coronavirus are: A patient might also complain of chills, headaches or a sore throat. Nausea or diarrhea have also been reported, though not in the numbers seen during SARS, and a blocked nose is less common again. The federal government has ruled people shouldn’t gather together except for “essential” activities such as school, public transport and work – but working from home is strongly encouraged and schools will move to mostly online lessons after Easter, except for students who have to attend in person. Shopping centres will stay open but food courts will be for takeaway only. People are urged to just buy what they need and not collect together or take time browsing. Those indoor gatherings still running should allow space for one person per four square metres. While the government is yet to move towards a full-scale shutdown of all but non-essential services, the following have already closed or suspended: The good news is the other thing shutting down is evictions – with a moratorium on evictions from commercial and residential rental properties as a “result of financial distress"" for the next six months. Services so far considered ""essential"" under a wider shutdown include pharmacies, fuel stations, health care, food shops and public transport and airports. Hairdressers and barbers are not on that list but can remain open for now – though they must strictly manage social distancing and the four-square-metre rule. The federal government says hotels, hostels, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be a decision for each state and territory. All non-urgent elective surgeries are postponed until further notice. Federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher has written to states and territories urging them to exempt telcos, postal services and media organisations from any future restrictions on movement as ""essential services"". Weddings are limited to five people – the couple, the celebrant and the witnesses – and funerals must be capped at 10 people, in what the government has called ""very difficult"" but necessary measures. JobSeeker is a payment of $550 a fortnight (now increased to $1100 a fortnight as part of a coronavirus stimulus boost) for those who have lost their employment. JobSeeker replaced the NewStart allowance in March. However, the new JobKeeper scheme is a $1500 payment (before tax) per staff member provided to employers by the government over the next six months to help businesses hold onto workers so that after the pandemic is over they can more easily start over. Employers can only receive the subsidy if they have turnover of less than $1 billion and this figure has fallen by 30 per cent or more, or they have a turnover higher than $1 billion and this has fallen by 50 per cent or more. Employers receiving the subsidy must report to the Australian Tax Office every month. See here for details. – Jennifer Duke At least one in 10 Australians have asthma but the condition doesn’t mean you’re more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack. “It’s a double-whammy, really,” says National Asthma Council Australia chief Siobhan Brophy. Respiratory physician Peter Wark says there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how COVID-19 affects asthmatics but, from previous experience with other respiratory illnesses, they’ll likely be at higher risk of complications – as was observed during the SARS outbreak and still occurs with common illnesses such as cold and flu. The WHO and other health authorities are urging extra precautions for asthmatics. Brophy says now is the time to be on your “best behaviour”: following your asthma plan and doctor’s advice to the letter and re-filling prescriptions so your lungs are in their best shape possible should an infection come. While people without the condition have been hoarding ventolin, she notes there’s little point as the medication is designed to treat an asthma attack and not COVID-19. There has been some concern about continuing asthma medication such as steroid tablets or injections, which could suppress the body's overall immune system, Brophy says, but steroid inhalers are still fine – they only travel to the lungs and remain vital for asthmatics. “Talk to your doctor before you stop taking anything but if you’re still using an old nebuliser to take your medication, use a puffer and a spacer instead. A nebuliser will spray out particles [and possibly germs] from your lungs."" Tell your doctor about your asthma and your medication if you develop symptoms. Replay   Coronaviruses are a family of viruses causing respiratory illness mostly found in animals. Only seven have been identified in humans, including the four that commonly give us coughs and colds. But when a new strain jumps across from wildlife, such as SARS and now this new strain, it can be dangerous as there is no natural immunity to fight it off. Because it's new, at first the virus was known simply as the ""novel"" coronavirus. Then the WHO named it SARS-CoV-2, given it shares so much of its DNA – about 75 per cent – with the SARS-CoV strain behind the SARS outbreak. The illness caused by this current strain is now called COVID-19. The illness was first identified after people started falling ill at wet market reported to sell wild animals in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unfounded theories that the virus is man-made quickly began to circulate online but scientists studying its genome already agree it came from animals - as more than 70 per cent of all new diseases emerging in humans do. Wild animals packed together and then butchered in live markets throughout Asia can be incubators for viruses to evolve and jump species barriers – SARS was traced back to a colony of bats but was believed to have passed into humans again in a wet market via the Himalayan palm civet, an ancient species of mammal eaten as a delicacy in China. And MERS also has bat origins but mostly spreads from infected camels, often in slaughterhouses. Bats are essential to many ecosystems we rely on but, through a lucky quirk in their immune system, they also carry a whole host of diseases that do not harm them. Early work suggests this new virus is 96 per cent similar to a SARS-like strain already discovered in bats a few years back, but experts think it likely first jumped into another animal, possibly the highly endangered and heavily trafficked pangolin, where it gained potency before passing into humans.  The question of who should practice this social distancing (everyone) versus who should seal themselves off completely has sparked some confusion. To stem the spread of COVID-19, millions of people infected or exposed around the world are also being urged to go into voluntary exile at home or in isolation wards. While some people have chosen to start home isolation themselves, thousands of others in Australia been already been issued formal notices to comply as states call in police to help enforce them. We dive into the rules in this explainer here but in brief: if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, then you must self-isolate for a full fortnight (the estimated period of virus incubation before symptoms appear). If you are self-isolating at home, your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food rather than going out, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch out for are a high fever and shortness of breath). If you are infected yourself or awaiting tests, then everyone should stay home. You can still wander into your garden or balcony but, while some officials have said you can walk the dog or stretch your legs, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says you must stay home if you've been told to self-isolate: ""Sorry."" Despite these rules, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said, on March 27, that Australia was still seeing large numbers of returned travellers with the virus and, in many cases, passing it on to their families. “More than two-thirds are returned travellers, and a significant proportion of the other cases have been transmitted from returned travellers,” he said. From March 29, all overseas arrivals are being escorted from airports into hotels and other accommodation for the 14-day window, at the government's expense. The army has been called in alongside police to enforce these quarantines after a number of people were caught out of their homes breaking self-isolation orders. Only if you really have to. Our borders have closed and overseas travel is now banned under biosecurity powers, except in exceptional circumstances. Citizens still travelling abroad are urged to come home as countries impose similar shutdowns of their own. Starting with Tasmania, most states have also started to close their domestic borders - police patrols will now ask people crossing over to go into quarantine for the recommended 14-day window. At this early stage, we are still not absolutely sure how the virus affects women and babies. Different governments have offered different advice.For now, let’s stick to what Australia’s peak body, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZOG), has to say. Note these guidelines are changing regularly and you should check back on their website for the most up-to-date advice. According to guidelines, at this stage it does not appear that pregnant women are at greater risk from COVID-19 than the rest of the population - like they were during the world's last pandemic Swine Flu in 2009.  However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. There is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or birth abnormalities, nor is there evidence the virus can pass from woman to unborn child or via breastmilk. “The safest place to birth your baby is in a hospital, where you have access to highly trained staff and emergency facilities,” the guidelines state. If the mother is infected at the time of birth, she should not be separated from her newborn, but should wear a mask and take precautions. The health advice is the same for pregnant women as it is for everyone else: work from home, avoid public places, and nail your hand hygiene. The RANZCOG guidelines suggest visitors in hospital are limited only to the immediate partner. But this is just a suggestion – different hospitals will have different rules. No. Public transport is still running as it is considered one of the essential activities exempt from the government's ban on gatherings but cleaning has been ramped up. While calls are growing from some experts to shut down public transport already, many people rely on it. Still, as social distancing rules come into force, travellers are deserting normally packed routes in droves. When on public transport, health officials say you should allow room for others as much as possible, rather than crowding in. It's also important to keep an eye on what you've been touching. If you then touch your face, a virus surviving on, say, a metal handrail could jump across – so carry a disinfectant or even wear one (stylish) glove for holding on and touching things. It appears that, as with SARS, it's possible for our pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about a pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a ""weak positive"" test for COVID-19, the WHO stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people, and no one should abandon their animals. Hong Kong authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners. (And the recent case of a tiger with another mild case in New York's Bronx Zoo has been linked to a sick staff member). The risk instead would come in if a pet itself became a contaminated ""surface"" (from all those sloppy kisses). You should exercise the usual cautions around animals, washing your hands after touching them. The most hopeful estimates fall within the range of 12 to 18 months. A report for the British government put it at “potentially 18 months or more”. Why? Because making a vaccine is really, really hard. To make a vaccine, you first need to design a way of giving a human immunity against a virus. Then you need to make sure the vaccine is not toxic. Then you need to test it in animals. Then you need to test it in humans – and the tests need to be large so we can make sure it works and is safe. And then you need to make the billions of doses needed. And there is every chance a vaccine that looks promising in the lab, or in animal tests, won’t work in humans. Experts are hoping to roll out a safe vaccine within 18 months. But even that would be unprecedented. No vaccine has ever been developed that quickly. - Liam Mannix, science reporter The Peter Doherty Institute in Australia is working on both a vaccine and a potential therapeutic treatment for the virus, and director Sharon Lewin says the latter might offer a faster fix. A drug that could block the virus from replicating in the body (or calm down the body's intense immune response to it) could keep patients with severe infections alive and, in the case of an antiviral, reduce transmission. Several existing drugs are now being trialled against the new virus worldwide, including those used to treat HIV, malaria, and arthritis. The results look promising but it's not time to rush out to the pharmacy just yet. It took this new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first thousand people. By contrast, SARS took 130 days and the less infectious MERS more than two years to infect a thousand people after it emerged in 2012. When SARS finished its spread after nine months in 2003, only 8098 cases had been confirmed across 26 countries but close to 10 per cent of those were fatal. (Most clusters happened in hospitals or households.) MERS has been circulating for eight years across 27 countries so far, and kills about a third of those who fall ill – out of about 2500 confirmed cases. Ebola is even more deadly, killing more than 40 per cent of those diagnosed over a number of outbreaks since the 1970s but it has been reported in just a handful of countries. In the pandemic records, the infamous 1918 Spanish flu killed about 2.5 per cent of its victims over two years – but because it infected so many people (close to 27 per cent of the world's population) at a time of much cruder medical care, about 50 million died. Today, doctors are much better able to stave off secondary bacterial infections, which proved particularly deadly during that outbreak. And, unlike the Spanish flu, young people are not dying at the same high rates. The last pandemic was swine flu in 2009, the second coming of a H1N1 influenza that infected between 11 and 21 per cent of the world's population. Governments mounted costly responses until it was ruled to be over in October 2010. But the virus killed about 285,000 people (fewer than seasonal flu normally does) with a relatively low fatality rate of .02 per cent, and the WHO copped criticism for labelling it a pandemic at all.

28,/sport/nrl/i-ll-do-everything-to-keep-nine-happy-v-landys-aims-to-heal-wounds-20200409-p54ipz.html,'I'll do everything to keep Nine happy': V'landys aims to heal wounds,"ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys is confident he can heal the administration's fractured relationship with Nine Entertainment after the media company delivered an unprecedented takedown of the NRL, accusing it of years of mismanagement. Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters.” In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfiled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic. Foxtel chief executive Patrick Delany did not return calls. Chris Barrett is Sports Editor of The Sydney Morning Herald. Copyright © 2020", Chris Barrett ,"April 9, 2020"

Bitter disputes have broken out across the sector as thousands of residents plan a rent strike and owners fear they will lose thousands of dollars in rent, with no government guarantees to ensure repayment when the economy comes out the other side of the coronavirus pandemic. Sydney business owner Kyara Coakes outside the warehouse for her property-styling business. Credit:James Brickwood Federal Housing Minister Michael Sukkar has called for at least a 50 per cent waiver of all rent for businesses in financial distress, warning they will be saddled with debt if they come out of hibernation without some of their rent dismissed altogether. But landlords say they are being forced to act as guarantors for businesses and would have no way of recouping deferred rent payments if their tenants went bankrupt during the crisis. On Tuesday morning, a neighbour alerted property stylist Kyara Coakes her landlord was out the front of her Chatswood business. Her rent was three days late. She had asked for a pause in her $7000-a-month repayments as her revenue dropped 90 per cent when house inspection after house inspection was cancelled. ""There are only two ways of resolving the issues – full payment [or] terminate the contract,"" her landlord had responded in an email. ""I was just really shocked,"" Ms Coakes said. ""She came to the property, threatening me and saying she would change the locks that afternoon."" The national cabinet announced a moratorium on evictions a week earlier but the states have yet to legislate on the issue, which means landlords are still within their rights to take action of the kind in Ms Coakes' situation. Government leaders have urged landlords and tenants to ""work it out between themselves"". On Tuesday, a mandatory code of conduct was formalised meaning landlords would be forced to waive and defer lease repayments in proportion to the loss of income experienced by a business, but this has also yet to be legislated. Replay   Ms Coakes' landlord, hospital software supplier Amy Luo, said her threats to evict Ms Coakes were part of her negotiating tactics. Ms Luo, who also owns property upstairs, said she had not actually changed the locks on Ms Coakes' business. She said the coronavirus had placed owners, tenants and businesses in an invidious position. ""Our government effectively asks all the small or large landlords to become the untitled banks for financing all the failed businesses,"" Ms Luo said. ""It's going to be such a mess. I have a bank loan. I have employees I need to pay. My business is also suffering. I don't share her profit. Why should I share her loss?"" Ms Luo said she had given Ms Coakes four days to come up with an alternative plan. ""I cannot offer any reduction in rent right now until I am clear with the government arrangements,"" she said. Landlords can apply to their banks for mortgage relief if they are experiencing financial distress but this will need to be paid back over the life of the loan. The Grattan Insitute's budget policy director, Danielle Wood, on Thursday said the government's rental response was ""half-baked"" and would mean many businesses did not make it through the coronavirus hibernation period without further government rental support. ""The code ultimately falls short on scale, scope, and speed,"" she said. In the residential sector, both NSW and Victoria have committed to the principle of land tax discounts in exchange for rental reductions but have not released any firm policies on how this would be delivered, leaving landlords and tenants frustrated as negotiations break down. Real estate agent Kirk Stafford said the industry was ""being besieged by tenant activists who are advising their cohort to simply strike and refuse to pay rent"". Tenants Victoria said it was hearing daily stories of ""no tolerance for people who fall behind in the rent"" even if they had lost their jobs because of coronavirus. Tracking research released on Thursday by Isentia showed since the first week of March, online conversations about paying the bills or rent had increased by 1033 per cent.

Adrian Brennock and Phillip Dixon were each awarded $200,000 plus legal costs when a judge found Gillian Norman had consistently defamed them on her two blogs and in an article she wrote for the Nimbin Good Times newspaper. The men were linked to a failed attempt to establish the ""Bhula Bhula Intentional Community"" on a property at Mount Burrell, near the alternative mecca of Nimbin in the Northern Rivers. The commune was at Mount Burrell, near the alternative mecca of Nimbin in northern NSW (pictured).Credit:Janie Barrett The commune was partially led by Mark Darwin, who conducted seminars on alternative living at Byron Bay's Lighthouse Cafe and numerous other locations, under the banner of Truthology, which he described as ""the study of the truth"". Mr Brennock and Mr Dixon were associates of Mr Darwin, who was originally also a plaintiff in the case but discontinued. Wollumbin Horizons purchased the land in June 2015, and in August that year Ms Norman paid $120,000 for a unit in the associated trust. The following month she took part in a monthly ""camp-out"" on the land, but set up her camp in an ""exclusion zone"" near the Tweed River bank. At the end of the weekend, Ms Norman did not leave the site with the other unit holders. ""Instead she remained in occupation and made her camp steadily more permanent. She placed a campervan on the site and established a garden,"" the judgment said. From the middle of that year, Tweed Shire Council received multiple complaints from neighbours about unauthorised developments on the land. In 2017, following an application from the council, the Land and Environment Court gave the community 28 days to remove shipping containers and other structures from the land. Several investors, including Ms Norman, attempted to recover their money but ""the company had no funds from which to meet these claims"" and Wollumbin Horizons was wound up in late 2017. In his defamation suit ruling on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Desmond Fagan said the commune project was ""undoubtedly a debacle"" and Mr Darwin should not have solicited investments without verifying that the council would grant the relevant approvals. But he found Ms Norman was unable to show any justification for her assertion the men's conduct  ""went beyond folly to fraud"". ""Nor does she recognise the degree to which her own lack of care and judgment contributed to her loss,"" Justice Fagan wrote. Ms Norman was self-represented in court except for the final two days of the trial, when she hired a lawyer who, in the words of the judge, ""introduced a measure of order and focus in the defendant's case that had been lacking until then"". Justice Fagan also granted a permanent injunction restraining Ms Norman from making any further publications on the issue, as he perceived she held an ""irrational attitude"" towards the plaintiffs.

Should it be a lottery? Who should make these decisions?

This is ultimately about deciding who lives and who dies, “that is the worst case scenario"", said Dr Dawson, who specialises in ethical dilemmas posed by infectious disease pandemics. The process is bureaucratically termed “resource allocation”. If the idea of allocating ICU beds based on formulas is too distasteful, “the most plausible alternative allocation method is using some kind of lottery system” that would give patients an equal chance of getting a bed, the Dawson framework said. A separate framework by bioethicists Professor Wendy Rogers at Macquarie University and Professor Stacy Carter at the University of Wollongong also floated the idea of a lottery. Random selection would be a last-resort mechanism or a “tie-breaker” if patients are equally eligible for an ICU bed.

""There are no easy answers,"" Professor Rogers said. Australian doctors hope they will never need to deploy the ethical frameworks; that Australia’s coronavirus response proves to be enough to keep transmission numbers low enough that the healthcare system will cope. But this has become the reality for their colleagues in parts of Italy, New York, France and Spain, who have needed to make these agonising decisions under immense pressure. ""Older patients are not being resuscitated and die alone without appropriate palliative care,"" doctors at Bergamo Hospital in Italy's worst-affected region of Lombardy wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. If Australian hospitals do reach a “tipping point” where patient numbers exceed resources, they will need to pivot from prioritising individual patient care to rationing beds, staff and equipment to maximise the number of lives saved. Australian hospitals could choose to prioritise patients who are healthcare workers so that they could get back to work, or young people over the older patients to maximise the years-of-life saved, or pregnant women, parents and carers with elderly relatives who depend on them. “We might also choose to prioritise First Nations communities,” Dr Dawson and his co-authors wrote, in part as ""compensation for previous sustained injustice"". Decisions should not be made on the basis of gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, religious or political view, it read. Replay   Professors Rogers and Carter warned decision-makers to be aware of their own cognitive biases that could lead to unintentional and unjustifiable discrimination against older people and those with disabilities. Hospitals could choose to prioritise the most critically ill patients, the most disadvantaged or the patients most likely to benefit from treatment. Whether COVID-19 patients should not be prioritised over other patients, the answer was an unequivocal “no” from Professor Dawson. Irrespective of the path hospitals follow, Dr Dawson said no patient would be callously left to die. “Even if you don’t receive access to a ventilator, that doesn’t mean you won’t have any care at all,” he said. “The worst case scenario is you should receive palliative care to relieve the symptoms you have."" He said any decision to prioritise one patient over another will be contentious, but patients, treating teams, and the public are more likely to accept them if the process is transparent and fair. Hospitals must establish an ethical committee that would make these decisions with “a level of detachment” so that doctors can advocate for their patients, and be shielded from the stress and anxiety of having to be the decision-makers, Dr Dawson said. It would also reduce any accusations of bias. “It’s a shame that there isn’t more time for public discussion and debate about this,” he said. The Rogers and Carter framework agreed these decisions must be made by a dedicated triage committee, not treating teams, and their protocols must be publicised, based on good reasons, open to appeals, consistent and accountable.

Blake Cochran is developing creative solutions to the protective equipment shortage.Credit:James Brickwood ""It’s all really been driven by them and their needs,"" he said. ""We’re here and ready to help."" The university, in collaboration with two local 3D printing companies, has been asked to produce 3000 face shields over the next three weeks. The university has been making about 400 shields a day. The University of Wollongong is part of the national CovidSOS network of universities and research centres working together to try to remedy the shortages of personal protective equipment. A survey of 1056 doctors in emergency departments and ICUs found more than two-thirds are worried they won’t have access to the protective equipment. Associate Professor Payal Mukerjee, an ENT surgeon at Sydney Adventist Hospital, helped set up the network when she found out first hand just how difficult it was to source equipment like masks. “I couldn’t buy them anywhere, no chemists had any stock,” she said. Universities are not used to manufacturing products, Associate Professor Mukerjee said, but if their prototype equipment was needed and deemed fit for purpose, it was possible for those institutions to scale up. “We need to all think differently and start stepping out of our comfort zone,” she said. It's not just universities helping.

""It's about looking at things differently."" NSW minister for jobs Stuart Ayres said the state government had received an “overwhelming response” to its call for local businesses to start producing much-needed medical supplies. ‘So far more than 1,260 businesses have registered their interest to supply or manufacture urgently needed medical equipment and hygiene products, and they are currently being assessed,” he said. “This is an opportunity for businesses to not only diversify their product offering but produce critical products for our state in a time of need.” Mr Ayres encouraged businesses with the capacity to help to register through the government website. The portal includes a list of needed supplies as well as the strict health specifications that are required. Ms Junor got an email from a doctor at a Sydney hospital saying he was struggling to get protective equipment where he worked, and wondering if she had the materials to make face shields. She came up with a prototype before making the first 20 kits of 35 masks, which volunteers put together. The shields were delivered to hospitals and GPs, and are also being used by chemists, cleaners and teachers. Prototypes of a 3D-printed face shield created by a team at UNSW have been sent to hospitals around Sydney and even as far as Gundagai for feedback. Dr Blake Cochran, a medical researcher and lecturer at UNSW, said it took just a couple of days to go from talking about potentially creating a face shield prototype to having products ready to test. “I never thought I'd work with industrial designers, it’s a creative approach to things,” he said. The face shields have been the focus of the UNSW team, but Dr Cochran said they would be happy to try designing something else. All it would take, he said, was for hospitals, local health districts or the health department to say “this is exactly what we need”. “Whatever the next need is, we’ve got really good people to help develop solutions,” he said.

On Thursday morning, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the government will spend $82 million to support the 260 council childcare centres not eligible for the federal government's JobKeeper payments.

It will apply to 700 state-funded community preschools and 38 mobile services that provide care to 45,000 three-to five-year-olds. Ms Berejiklian said the number of new cases continues to decline as she reiterated the government's message to ""not leave your home unless you absolutely have to"". She also addressed those who would normally attend a church service over Easter. ""I know this would be so difficult for many of you, it may be the first Easter where you have not attended a church service or religious gathering, but we're all in this together and I appreciate what everyone is going through,"" the Premier said. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the increase in new cases is at its lowest levels since March 16 - with 39 cases in the past 24 hours. The total number of cases in NSW sits at 2773.

The proposal has been put forward by businessman Tony Shepherd and would see every wage and salary earner given the choice to receive their 9.5 per cent superannuation contribution in their pay packet for a six-month period. Tony Shepherd has suggested giving workers the option to be paid their super now rather than at retirement for six months. Credit:Brook Mitchell ""That is equivalent to a 9.5 per cent overnight increase in pay available to every working Australian. An increase on which they will pay tax according to their tax bracket,"" Mr Shepherd said. If everyone chose to accept their super guarantee as pay, it would be worth about $100 billion a year. A former chair of Transfield and Business Council of Australia president, Mr Shepherd said the move increases income tax revenue and comes at no cost to government or businesses. ""This would be a much needed boost to a dissolving economy and just as importantly give a lift to consumer and business confidence."" However, a spokesman for the Treasurer said this was not a policy that is being considered by the government. It has also been rejected by the superannuation industry as ineffective and short-sighted. Dr Martin Fahy, the chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, said safeguarding contributions to funds was necessary to ensure the $3 trillion sector could recapitalise the economy once the crisis passes, like it did after the global financial crisis. ""As we come across this bridge, funds will need to play an important role in the equity raising which will be an important part of [rebuilding the economy]. Obviously having a robust [superannuation guarantee] contribution coming into funds will be important,"" he said. Dr Fahy also pointed to the ""huge"" level of government stimulus that is ""yet to hit individuals pockets"". ""We need to let the measures that have been announced have an impact. Let's see what they achieve first,"" he said. Media Super chief executive Graeme Russell agreed the idea would be a short-sighted overreaction, and said we should ""keep the economy going as best we can"". ""While there might be 15 to 20 per cent of people unemployed or underemployed, there are a whole lot of people still in work and a number of businesses still going. ""I can't see why you would further disrupt economic processes,"" Mr Russell said. ""When the recovery comes, it's going to need capital investment. Where's the source of capital investment in this country? The $3 trillion in superannuation funds is a good start."" Sources with knowledge of the superannuation system, who asked to be kept anonymous as the topic is sensitive, have warned that the idea could lead to greater concerns about liquidity for the funds. This has been a major concern amid the recently announced early-access scheme that allows struggling workers to withdraw up to $20,000 of their superannuation. Grattan Institute household finances program director Brendan Coates said moving to a period of voluntary payments was ""not something we would support"". ""It would be imprudent to unwind compulsory superannuation during the COVID-19 crisis,"" he said. The think tank has argued against a legislated increase in the superannuation guarantee levy, saying the current level is appropriate, but said the early-release scheme now available to those facing hardship was adequate. He said there was scope to allow people to withdraw more funds from their super early if the $20,000 was not enough. ""[The government] should consider this in about three to six months."" However, Mr Coates said the coronavirus crisis would raise more doubts about a legislated increase in super payments at a time when people needed the income now rather than in the future, following the think tank's research showing a trade-off between wages and super.

Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg said the measures around the early access to superannuation, which kicks in on April 20, were ""appropriate"" in their current form.

The nation's four remaining refineries are under pressure as profit margins collapse along with global fuel demand. Since the virus outbreak, petrol demand has fallen 50 per cent and jet fuel demand 70 per cent worldwide as airlines ground flights and people are urged to stay home. Caltex has brought forward a temporary shutdown of its Lytton refinery for maintenance work as the coronavirus puts pressure on profit margins. Credit:Dan Peled. Fuel giant Caltex cited cashflow problems and margin pressure when it announced on Monday it would temporarily shut its Lytton refinery in Brisbane from May for extended maintenance work, while Viva Energy on Thursday said it was deciding whether to proceed with a $100 million investment to prolong the life of its Geelong refinery. Mr Taylor said the federal government was working with the major petroleum refiners ""to better understand their current challenges and to guarantee the security of Australia's liquid fuel"". He stressed Australia had a ""highly reliable fuel supply"" and the decisions about the two refineries would ""not hinder our immediate fuel security"". ""Australian motorists can be assured there is a good supply of fuel products in the market at lower prices. There is no need to panic buy,"" he said. The pressure facing refineries and the potential for disruption to international ports and shipping from coronavirus restrictions have prompted calls from Labor and the national motorists' peak body for the government to consider measures to secure local refining capacity. Australia imports around 90 per cent of its fuel. A report last year by the federal Energy Department found while Australia's four refineries were ""expected to remain viable in the foreseeable future"", their continued viability ""depends on the investment strategy of individual companies"". Global demand for refined fuel was expected to peak in the 2030s and it was ""unlikely that new oil refineries in Australia would ever be economical"", the report said. NRMA spokesman Peter Khoury said it viewed disruption to domestic refining as a reason to reconsider government policy. ""We remain concerned that our refining capacity is falling in Australia; we don't want narrow margins to dictate when refineries are closed,"" he said. ""There's a great temptation to import refined product due to the economies of scale in Asian refineries and so on, but that has to be weighed up against the national interest. ""But I stress that to motorists today this means nothing. In fact, there are tankers backed up around the world due to oversupply."" Labor energy spokesman Mark Butler said fuel security was an ""extremely important issue"" for Australia and the government ""need to develop a clear plan that explains how Australia will safeguard and modernise its existing refining capacity, especially as refiners face the impacts of the current pandemic"".

Federal, state and territory leaders are still finalising what term two will look like across the country after the school holidays. Education ministers are weighing up options for a staggered shift towards more normal school operations, which could see year 12 students and those in more hands-on subjects returning to campuses for some sessions. Education Minister Dan Tehan has directed private schools to be open. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The national cabinet meeting on Thursday discussed schools, focusing on a coherent approach after Easter holidays amid confusion among parents and teachers. Government sources said the leaders were working towards a more consistent national position on which children should be attending school, although no decisions have been made. While most private schools have been maintaining in-person supervision options for children of essential services workers in addition their rollout of distance learning, Mr Tehan has written to independent school peak bodies highlighting a ""small number"" that have closed their campuses entirely. ""While I appreciate that a number of jurisdictions are moving towards this form of service delivery, I am asking schools to retain a physical classroom environment for the children of parents who may not have a choice of keeping children at home,"" Mr Tehan wrote. He said the students might be children of essential workers but added pupils should ""not be refused physical classroom access based on their parent's employment"". Under federal legislation, Mr Tehan has the authority to impose additional conditions on funding for private schools. He said he was using this power to include a condition starting from term two ""requiring schools to provide a physical classroom education environment for the children of parents who choose to access it"". Mr Tehan told reporters on Thursday he wanted schools to be open for safety reasons. ""We want them open so children can be safely cared for if their parents are working or if there are other reasons where children are much more safe at school rather than at home,"" he said. Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week? Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students – would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" Victorian students are scheduled to return to school on April 14 under an online learning model. NSW students are due to return on April 27. Attendance, which plummeted in March, could rise after the holidays. Medical officials are looking at how to make schools safer, with bolstered hygiene and social distancing measures.

Independent Schools Victoria chief executive Michelle Green said private schools had been put in an ""impossible position"", caught between conflicting advice between state and federal authorities. She said the federal government's directive that independent schools remain open for the children of all parents who want it was in contrast to the Victorian government's advice that schools remain open for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. ""This has left teachers, parents and, ultimately, their students confused and frustrated at a time of extraordinary stress,"" Ms Green said. Victorian Education Minister James Merlino said he was working to ensure ""the same message, the same arrangements"" across all school systems. While the federal government has maintained the official medical advice is that schools should be open and children should attend, state governments have been taking different approaches. The NSW and Victorian government have been encouraging parents to keep their children at home. Sources said leaders were working to avoid significant dissonance between different jurisdictions so no students were disadvantaged. The priority remains consistent advice on term two before considering other issues with schools. Mr Tehan said on Thursday the NSW and Victorian positions reflected the greater spread of COVID-19 in the states. Those governments have also faced pressure from teachers' unions over the risk to staff, especially those in vulnerable demographics.  Mr Tehan said education ministers were looking at options to make school systems more flexible and open for some students. ""Is there an opportunity maybe to bring year 12 students back one day a week? Or would there be an opportunity for those doing vocational education at school to do some of their practical work at school? Or chemistry students – would they be able to come to school one or two afternoons a week to do the practical side of their chemistry?"" Victorian students are scheduled to return to school on April 14 under an online learning model. NSW students are due to return on April 27. Attendance, which plummeted in March, could rise after the holidays. Medical officials are looking at how to make schools safer, with bolstered hygiene and social distancing measures.

""I expect there will be a vaccine that works and is safe and comes online, and the numbers will come down dramatically. But this is a viral infection that will stay with us. It's not going away,"" he said. Mesoblast major shareholder and CEO, Professor Silviu Itescu. Credit:Josh Robenstone The chief of the regenerative medicine company also warned against relaxing any social distancing rules in the coming months, observing Australia's relatively low rate of infections was a result of the national shutdown. ""I would be very concerned about relaxing it, especially with the winter months coming,"" he said. ""Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to put it back in again."" On Thursday, Mesoblast told the Australian stock exchange it had secured an agreement with the US National Institute of Health to test its stem cell treatment on coronavirus patients and establish whether it will reduce the mortality of patients with severe respiratory illness caused by the virus. The company's Remestemcel-L product will be evaluated in a trial of 240 patients with COVID-19 to test its effectiveness in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome. This can occur after the body's immune system has an excessive response to the virus, called a cytokine storm, which in turn results in damage to lung tissue. The mortality rate of those with acute respiratory distress syndrome because of coronavirus is as high as 80 per cent. Remestemcel-L has been developed for other inflammatory conditions and was successful in a Phase-3 trial in children to treat a condition called acute graft-versus-host disease,  a condition in which the body's immune cells attack healthy cells after a bone marrow transplant. The thinking is that those with acute respiratory distress syndrome have similarities in terms of the inflammation response seen in those with acute graft-versus-host disease. Dr Itescu said the company will evaluate whether the treatment will reduce coronavirus mortality rates within a 28-day period. It will take around three months to recruit patients for the trial but there should be some indications of the treatment's effectiveness as early as July, he said. ""It will then be to sit down with the FDA and talk about whether the data is strong enough. [If it is], what we need to plan for is how to scale up manufacturing."" The Mesoblast share price, which had already rocketed higheron news it was turning its focus to the coronavirus crisis, surged another 36 per cent to $2.50 on Thursday. The company, which counts Anthony Pratt and Alex Waislitz among its investors, has been paving the way over recent weeks for the coronavirus trial. On Monday, it received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to try Remestemcel-L with patients who had showed severe respiratory distress because of the virus.

Viva Energy, which owns the 65-year-old refinery and thousands of Australia's Shell-branded petrol stations, said on Thursday it would make deep cuts to its investment budget for the year ahead and reconsider its major maintenance spending at the plant. The works were mapped out earlier this year in a program to prolong the operating life of one of the country's four remaining oil refineries and one of Geelong's ""last remaining industrial businesses"". Viva Energy operates the Geelong oil refinery.Credit:Craig Sillitoe Viva said its decision to reconsider the plans was driven by the need to ""preserve cashflow"" as well as ensure compliance with social-distancing measures to minimise the risk of an infection outbreak. The program would have involved temporarily bringing another 1000 workers to the site in addition to the 700 typically employed there. ""We will also closely monitor the longer-term refining margin outlook which continues to evolve,"" Viva said, adding it would complete its review and update the market by the end of June. Viva's Geelong refinery, which can process up to 120,000 barrels a day, is the second largest among the country's four remaining refineries and supplies about 10 per cent of Australia's liquid fuel needs. Margins at the site have crashed to $US2.70 a barrel in the March quarter, down from $US4.90 a year earlier. The nation's other refiners have also been hit hard by global efforts to arrest the spread of the deadly pandemic as borders close, airlines slash flights and passengers cancel travel plans. The outbreak has slashed petrol demand by half and jet fuel demand by 70 per cent. Viva's announcement comes after rival fuel giant Caltex said on Monday it would extend a shutdown of its Brisbane oil refinery, where margins have similarly collapsed in recent months. Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the government was working with the refiners to ensure no disruption to Australia's fuel supplies amid the coronavirus emergency. ""The Australian government recognises that this is a difficult time for oil refineries worldwide, including refineries in Australia,"" he said. ""Australia has a highly reliable fuel supply and these decisions from refineries will not hinder our immediate fuel security."" With fuel demand hit by the coronavirus, Mr Taylor said Australian motorists could be assured there was a good supply of fuel products in the market. ""There is no need to panic buy,"" he said. Australia has become increasingly reliant on imported fuel over the past decade, with three of the nation's seven domestic refineries closing down and domestic production of liquid fuels declining sharply. However, the government and industry figures are confident in the reliability of Australia's fuel supply due to the fact Australia imports fuel from more than 70 nations, with no single country providing more than 20 per cent of petroleum imports.

Instead, the coronavirus pandemic has upended its business. The Wall Street Journal reported that Airbnb's recent $US1 billion funding round came with stringent terms.

Airbnb is one of several travel-related companies suffering especially deeply during the coronavirus pandemic, when many would-be American and international travellers have been told to stay at home. It's also under fire from expected guests who say its refund process is too complicated after they were forced to cancel their plans. Many customers told CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez the company was making them jump through too many hoops to get their money back. The company asked some guests to provide proof they are restricted from travelling, and others fell outside the original travel-date window for refunds. ""Airbnb needs to rest this problem before it becomes a larger and more expensive problem for them to solve,"" Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group, told Salvador. It's an ironic position for the startup that launched at the precipice of the 2008 financial crisis that is now facing another economic slowdown at a key moment. And Airbnb is under intense pressure to show it can maintain its position as a Silicon Valley powerhouse. An additional $US1 billion ($1.6 billion) in the bank could help. Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky says the money will allow the company to be in a strong strategic position when travel rebounds. He says the company will evolve to address the ways travel may change in the virus's aftermath. ""We'll see a new flexibility in how people live and work, which means they won't have to be tethered to one location,"" Chesky said in a news release. ""And with an emerging interest in travel that's closer to home, our customers will look to nearby places to visit, and for local experiences to take part in."" The company has been aggressively working to preserve its relationships with customers, spokesman Ben Breit told me. ""Our community support team has been working around-the-clock against this global crisis to help both hosts and guests throughout a situation that has been challenging for the entire industry,"" Breit said. ""We activated our Extenuating Circumstances policy to provide guests with full refunds or credit because we believe this is the responsible thing to do given the guidance of governments and health experts."" Airbnb's promise to offer customers who booked between March 14 and April 14 a 100 per cent refund puts it out ahead of other travel booking services' refund policies, such as VRBO. But as the CNBC report underscores, disbursing those refunds has come with significant challenges. Airbnb is also under pressure to support hosts who have seen a loss of income due to cancellations related to the pandemic. The company has committed to pay those who will no longer host guests at their properties $US250 million to cover 25 per cent of the fees they would normally charge. The company also lobbied to ensure that hosts would be eligible for unemployment benefits in the recent federal stimulus package.

55,/business/banking-and-finance/bank-dividend-cuts-were-inevitable-with-or-without-apra-s-direction-20200409-p54ik8.html,"Bank dividend cuts were inevitable, with or without APRA's direction","The Australian banking regulator’s decision to direct banks to defer or materially reduce their dividends this week was prudent, but probably unnecessary. The major banks would have been considering reducing their payouts to shareholders with or without the direction from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority as they seek to conserve capital at a moment of great uncertainty and significantly reduced profitability. The impact of the coronavirus on the banks is a great unknown. They made quite extraordinary concessions to their business and retail customers; measures that will cost them cash flow and earnings during and well beyond the duration of the pandemic. The major banks showed last year they were prepared to tailor their dividend payouts to their circumstances. And they have no idea – as no-one at this stage does – how long the lock-down of large slabs of the economy will last, nor how many businesses will re-emerge when it ends. The extent of the longer-term impacts on employment and households is another unknown. While the banks may have had no other realistic choice but to support their customers if they wanted to emerge from this episode with customers, the effect of their actions is to put a significant hole of uncertain dimensions in their earnings and capital bases as they effectively subsidise large swathes of those customers, knowing that many of those subsidies will end up as bad debts. And the challenges to bank profitability don’t only flow from the actions the lenders have taken to provide life support for their customers, and the economy. The Reserve Bank’s actions in cutting the cash rate to 25 basis points and targeting a three-year bond rate at that same level by buying bonds will further squeeze net interest margins that were already under pressure. Last year, for perhaps the first time ever, the big four banks had an average net interest margin below 2 per cent. It’s going to be even lower now, even though the RBA has created a $90 billion-plus funding facility at 25 basis points to help them provide funding to small and medium-sized businesses. The major banks showed last year that they were prepared to tailor their dividends to the circumstances. NAB and Westpac cut their dividends and ANZ lowered its franking level. There’s no reason to believe that, had APRA not provided its directive, they would have left their dividends levels intact. While reducing their shareholder payouts will shore up the banks' capital levels – and a system already arguably the strongest in the world – it will come with some unfortunate consequences for the army of self-funded retirees who rely on franked dividends, particularly major bank dividends, for their income. The banks will have choices in responding to APRA, and will be conscious of that reliance their retail investors have on dividends to fund their living expenses. They could pay reduced dividends or they could pay out nothing at all until their situations become clearer. They could defer their interim dividends (except for the Commonwealth Bank which, with a June balance date, has already paid its interim dividend) and pay increased annual dividends or even a special dividend once the dust settles. They could maintain their dividends but have them underwritten, effectively issuing matching equity and therefore maintaining their capital bases. With an average share price fall of about 40 per cent since the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic became evident in late February, the banks would be reluctant to contemplate capital raisings. So retaining their earnings is the easiest, most efficient and least dilutive form of capital generation. Big capital raisings like those the banks made during the global financial crisis would be the option of last resort, one that would be made more difficult, or at last more expensive and dilutive, if the banks do cut or defer their dividends. Australia's banks entered this pandemic-induced financial crisis operating in one of the strongest banking systems in the world. Thanks to APRA’s decisive implementation of the recommendations of the Murray inquiry into the financial system, they are as well-capitalised and hold as much liquidity as any system. They have relatively low-risk balance sheets because of their big bias towards lending for housing , which is even more the case now that most of them (NAB being the exception) have shed their wealth management businesses. In the post-GFC era, they have also dramatically reduced their exposure to short-term wholesale funding markets, which means the decisions of credit ratings agencies are of less consequence than they might have been in the past. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. This week Fitch downgraded the major banks, and S&P lowered its outlook for them but that should have only a marginal impact on their funding costs. S&P has also, not surprisingly, lowered the outlook for Australia’s credit rating, which would flow through to the banks’ ratings given that governments’ ability to support their banks is a factor in the banks’ own ratings. The quandary over dividends encapsulates the wider uncertainties faced by banks globally, most of whom are in poorer condition to weather the economic and financial fallout from the coronavirus than Australia's banks. In advising the big banks to defer or reduce their dividends, APRA was effectively following the lead of Europe, the UK and New Zealand, all of whom have told their banks to suspend dividend payments. The European banks have less capital and have been far less profitable than their Australian counterparts, and the impact of the coronavirus is, up to now, far more profound and damaging to the populations and economies in Europe and the UK than it is here. The Morrison government also had a starting point of one of the more conservative fiscal positions of any developed world economy, enabling it to effectively throw the kitchen sink at the economy. That, and the relative success at containing the virus, will hopefully enable an earlier, stronger and more broadly-based recovery in Australia than might occur elsewhere, reducing the peak period of pressure on the banking system in the process.

The Morrison government also had a starting point of one of the more conservative fiscal positions of any developed world economy, enabling it to effectively throw the kitchen sink at the economy. That, and the relative success at containing the virus, will hopefully enable an earlier, stronger and more broadly-based recovery in Australia than might occur elsewhere, reducing the peak period of pressure on the banking system in the process.

Here's why,"Washington: US President Donald Trump unleashed a tirade against the World Health Organisation on Tuesday, accusing it of acting too slowly to sound the alarm about the coronavirus. It was not the first time in this pandemic that the global health body has faced such criticism. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organisation.Credit:Bloomberg Government officials, health experts and analysts have in recent weeks raised concerns about how the organisation has responded to the outbreak. In Japan, Taro Aso, the deputy prime minister and finance minister, recently noted that some people have started referring to the World Health Organisation as the ""Chinese Health Organisation"" because of what he described as its close ties to Beijing. Taiwanese officials say the WHO ignored its early warnings about the virus because China refuses to allow Taiwan, a self-governing island it claims as its territory, to become a member. Critics say the WHO has been too trusting of the Chinese government, which initially tried to conceal the outbreak in Wuhan. Others have faulted the organisation and its leader, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, for moving too slowly in declaring a global health emergency. The WHO, a UN agency, has defended its response, saying on Wednesday that it alerted the world to the threat posed by the virus in a timely manner and that it was ""committed to ensuring all member states are able to respond effectively to this pandemic"". The agency's defenders say that its powers over any individual government are limited, and that it has done the best it can in dealing with a public health threat with few precedents in history. There will be time later to assess successes and failings, ""this virus and its shattering consequences,"" the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday in a statement praising the WHO as ""absolutely critical"" to vanquishing COVID-19. Here's why the WHO is coming under attack. Replay   When cases of a mysterious viral pneumonia first appeared in Wuhan in December, Chinese health officials silenced whistleblowers and repeatedly played down the severity of the outbreak. Even as late as mid-January, as the virus spread beyond China's borders, Chinese officials described it as ""preventable and controllable"" and said there was no evidence it could be transmitted between humans on a broad scale. The WHO endorsed the government's claims, saying in mid-January, for example, that human-to-human transmission had not been proven. Critics say the organisation's repeated deference to Beijing exacerbated the spread of the disease. A group of international experts was not allowed to visit Wuhan until mid-February. ""They could have been more forceful, especially in the initial stages in the crisis when there was a cover-up and there was inaction,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert specialising in China at Seton Hall University. Chinese health officials in protective suits process Wuhan travellers going into 14-day quarantine on arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.Credit:Getty Images Huang noted that during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, which killed less than 800 people worldwide, the WHO pushed the Chinese government to be more transparent by publicly criticising it for trying to conceal the outbreak. At one point during the SARS epidemic, officials at hospitals in Beijing forced SARS patients into ambulances and drove them around to avoid their being seen by a visiting delegation of WHO experts, according to reports at the time. Even as the virus spread to more than half a dozen countries and forced China to place parts of Hubei province under lockdown in late January, the WHO was reluctant to declare it a global health emergency. WHO officials said at the time that a committee that discussed the epidemic was divided on whether to call it an emergency but concluded that it was too early. One official added that they weighed the impact such a declaration might have on the people of China. After the United States announced a ban on most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, the WHO again seemed to show deference to Chinese officials, saying that travel restrictions were unnecessary. The group officially called the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11. Some experts argue that the institution's delay in making such declarations deprived other countries of valuable time to prepare hospitals for an influx of patients. ""It reinforced the reluctance to take early strong measures before the catastrophe had actually landed on other shores,"" said François Godement, senior adviser for Asia at Institut Montaigne, a non-profit group in Paris. ""The WHO's tardiness or reluctance to call out the problem in full helped those who wanted to delay difficult decisions."" The WHO defended its actions, saying on Wednesday that it had ""alerted member states to the significant risks and consequences of COVID-19 and provided them with a continuous flow of information"" ever since Chinese officials first reported the outbreak on December 31.

The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by UN special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Medical staff set up a coronavirus quarantine ward at a hospital in Sanaa, Yemen.Credit:AP The ceasefire will go into effect at midday on Thursday, Yemen time, for two weeks and is open to extension, he said in a statement. The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities. The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah. But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen.

Credit:AP ""[Our proposal] will lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces. Last week, UN envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen. Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilise this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace."" A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the US Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"". The UN and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support. Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities. Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria. Saudi Vice-Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $US500 million ($800 million) to the UN humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $US25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus.

We need a steady march to reform - and a broader tax base,"The 1987 federal election campaign was defined by the TV add featuring “whingeing Wendy”, a suburban housewife questioning John Howard from her kitchen, with devastating effect, about the financing of his promised $8 billion tax cut: Where’s the money coming from? Scott Morrison's challenge is to transform the economy, not to wait for it to snap back to its already weak position.
Credit: Jim Pavlidis Wendy listed an emotive range of possible “cuts” – home nursing, meals on wheels, pharmaceutical benefits, asthma and diabetes allowances, pensions, Medicare, child minding centres. The result was an historic third Labor win in a row, with an expanded margin of 24 seats (previously 16), despite a swing of 1 per cent against the government, and a small win by Howard in the popular vote. Howard’s case wasn’t helped when the finally released funding of his tax cuts didn’t add up, compounding the substance of Wendy’s question. While oppositions have always been bedevilled to provide funding detail, governments have struggled with the reality, to deliver responsible, conservative, fiscal management – Fraser undoing Whitlam’s profligacy, Hawke/Keating coming out of global recession and post-Fraser, Keating again after the early-90s recession, and Rudd/Gillard/Abbott/ Turnbull/ Morrison post-global financial crisis. Over the past five decades since 1970, the maximum budget deficit has been a little over 4 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 90s, and the biggest surplus was about 2 per cent in the early 2000s. The achievement of a budget surplus, a commitment to repay debt, and preservation of global credit rating have become increasing obsessions. Throughout, with the exceptions of the conspicuous periods of largesse under Whitlam and Howard, budgets have been mostly driven by varying degrees of austerity while seeking to avoid new taxes, although there has been a significant reliance on “bracket creep” in personal tax. On the brink of achieving the cherished budget surplus – of being “back in the black” – the impact of COVID-19, the Morrison government has launched fiscal measures worth almost $200 billion so far, about five times the Rudd packages in response to the GFC. Then there is almost a $100 billion liquidity injection from the RBA on top of a near-zero cash rate. Scott Morrison would have us believe all this is temporary, not structural, and that we can “bounce”,  indeed “snap”, back when the virus is under control. But snap back to what? And how quickly? We already had a weak and weakening economy, riddled with significant structural challenges, low business and consumer confidence, record household debt, flat wages, increasing job insecurity, low productivity and a majority struggling to meet a mounting cost of living? Not to mention neglect of the longer-term imperatives such as the transition to a low-carbon society over the next three decades? But what exactly will suddenly give households the confidence to spend, and businesses to invest? Or will government spending have to keep sustaining growth, and if so how will it be paid for? The prospective blowout of hundreds of billions in the budget deficit, and national debt, dwarfs anything since World War II. It will take decades to bring under control. This on top of what were already a host of unfunded commitments – Gonski and education, health, defence, the NDIS, infrastructure, and the legislated tax cuts. Former finance secretary Mike Keating had been predicting an inevitable increase in the overall tax burden of some 2 to 3 per cent of GDP in the 2020s. It will not be possible to stick with commitments to magic budget numbers. And we've learned just how long it will take to restore unemployment rates (likely to at least double) to near-full employment. Does Morrison imagine it will be easy to snap back from having increased the JobSeeker allowance or providing free childcare, or to avoid pressure to convert his JobKeeper payments into a universal living wage? Can he accept many businesses will still fail?  Howard found out just how tough it could be to take back what was given as a benefit, against the expectation that it had become a right. Lessons too from Tony Abbott’s attempt at extreme austerity, especially without effective consultation, that culminated in his failed 2014 budget. Morrison has no alternative but to shift gear into longer-term strategic planning, and to reassess national priorities right across government, industry and civil society, and in our global relations, especially with the US, China and our Asia-Pacific neighbours. This should lead to broad-based tax and reform of expenditure and the federation. More tinkering will be inadequate. Big trade-offs will need to be made, such as scrapping submarines and expensive and ill-considered defence procurement, in favour of important social programs. Infrastructure bonds could make an effective distinction between debt for recurrent spending and that for self-financing capital. We could eliminate or containing expensive and inequitable tax concessions. We should broaden the tax base and scrap profit as the basis of corporate tax. We need better tax arrangements between the federal and state governments and a re-allocation of spending and policy responsibilities. My fear is that the economic disruption and poor growth will last much longer than expected. Without a longer-term strategy, the government’s packages will only serve to compound our debt problems, leading to an ultimate debt crisis.

68,/business/the-economy/early-access-to-super-must-target-the-most-needy-20200409-p54iok.html,Early access to super must target the most needy,"At a time when tens of thousands of people are desperately short of money because of the coronavirus crisis, one obvious source of funds is the $3 trillion pool of superannuation savings. While, in theory, that money is supposed to be kept to fund retirement in the future, the government has announced it will allow people to access their savings early if they need it to put food on the table and pay the rent now. People who meet new relaxed criteria of financial hardship will be able to take out up to $20,000 over the next six months. Former Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd has proposed an even more liberal approach, arguing that people should have the option of taking the 9.5 per cent of wages earmarked for compulsory superannuation contributions as cash over the next six months. In the financial world, however, simple solutions can often have unforeseen, indirect consequences and superannuation investors should not take their money out without thinking it through. Because of the recent falls in the sharemarket anyone who takes their money out now will receive as much as 30 per cent less than their account was worth two months ago. That will be their choice and it might prove a reasonable trade-off, but it comes at a cost. Taking a thousand dollars out now will mean they receive many thousands of dollars less in retirement. Industry superannuation funds have also warned that in giving early access they must take into account the interests of the other people with money still invested in their funds and the broader economy. If super funds have to sell shares at once, it will tend to push down share prices, which means all fund members’ account balances will be hit. All superannuation funds are required to keep  cash on hand to meet these sorts of emergencies, which will probably mean funds will have cash on hand to meet a rush of withdrawals. But the Reserve Bank of Australia, in its twice yearly Financial Stability Report published on Thursday, pointed out that some super funds with lots of young members working in industries heavily affected by the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail, will face a “large liquidity drain”. With less cash, funds could miss out on opportunities to pick up shares at bargain prices, leaving all members worse off, once markets recover. This poses a dilemma for superannuation funds and some say they will have to apply some type of charge for early withdrawals to compensate. Given all those risks, the government’s scheme probably strikes a fair balance between allowing early access to superannuation to the most desperate on the one hand and protecting long-term members and the economy on the other. The Australian Tax Office has just issued detailed criteria. That does not seem to be the case for Mr Shepherd’s proposal of an opt-out from the 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee as it could put cash in the pockets of everyone regardless of need. Superannuation has a role to play in protecting Australians from the looming economic crisis but the government must also protect the integrity of the retirement system which is a major engine of investment in the economy.

69,/national/the-late-night-covid-text-that-made-me-maintain-the-cage-20200402-p54gm5.html,The late-night COVID text that made me maintain the cage,"The late-night text message scared the crap out of me. I was about to get into bed when I noticed it on my mobile, along with the word “urgent”. It said I had been in close contact with someone who had COVID-19 while on a flight the week before and I needed to self-isolate. Replay   I knew I was likely to be exposed to the virus sooner or later. But quite frankly, I was hoping for later. I'd been exhausted a few moments ago. Now I was wide-eyed and awake. What would I tell my partner, who has respiratory issues and was sleeping in the next room? Would she have to move into an Airbnb or hotel? Flying in the time of COVID-19: Workers in protective suits disinfect a plane.Credit:AP I found myself muttering and moaning, trying to figure out which bastard on the flight had exposed me. Was it the guy in the next aisle, who had taken off his mask after the first 10 minutes of the four-hour flight and seemed to delight in wildly sneezing all over the cabin while keeping his hands steadily on the tablet in front of him instead of containing his high-velocity nose droplets? Was it the guy behind me who had kept coughing but had assured me it was merely asthma? I didn’t trust any of the shifty-eyed buggers. The next morning I told my partner and we both freaked out together in a non-calm, non-civilised manner. Then we pretended to be calm and civilised and my partner half-packed a suitcase while reading as many medical articles as she could. Writer Dan Kaufman. “Do you still have your sense of smell?” she asked. Yes, I could smell the cigarette smoke wafting through the window from one of my neighbours, while also imagining it creating cell receptors in my lungs that would make me more vulnerable to COVID-19. “Can you still taste?” she asked, and no, I won’t make a bad joke about the taste of bitterness. The self-isolation period for me was 14 days from the date of the flight – and at this point eight days had passed. By now, more than 90 per cent of people with COVID-19 would show symptoms and yet I didn’t have any. My partner decided to stay home, provided I took self-isolation to a new level by remaining largely in my bedroom, which we renamed “the cage”. Stuck with my scenic view of a carpark and the smokers who always congregate in it, I began to wish she’d moved into an Airbnb. I never showed any symptoms and neither, thankfully, did my partner. Still, I can’t help wondering if – or how many more times – this will happen again. Dan Kaufman is a writer and editor.

70,/national/stop-looking-for-loopholes-what-are-the-new-covid-19-social-rules-20200407-p54hyd.html,'Stop looking for loopholes': What are the new COVID-19 social rules?,"Guests are pinged for being at a dinner party. Five young people in a car are fined for driving around aimlessly together. Three friends are fined for playing video games in a loungeroom. All had breached laws aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. In our new reality during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter where you live in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised there are really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Bottom line: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care,"" as federal government text messages are saying. Sound a bit full-on? So are the potential consequences of getting COVID-19. The idea of these rules is to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus by limiting contact with others, thereby flattening the rate of infections and ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed. So far, Australians have been doing a good job of following the rules. The number of new infections recorded every day is falling. But our medical experts have warned now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"" – complacency could see Australia lose its window to contain the outbreak, and cases rapidly explode again. As questions from you flood into police, governments – and our newsrooms – about what will and won't get you fined on the spot, we've scoured guidelines and public comments from leaders, and put your questions to governments and the police. Here is what we know so far. In all states, you can still visit someone in an emergency or to provide care – or even drop off supplies. But when it comes to social visits to households, it's the unnecessary guests that are now advised against, even if you live alone. Spending time together inside a house, as opposed to on a walk outside (1.5 metres apart), gives the virus more opportunities to spread in bathrooms and kitchens. Victoria has taken one of the tougher lines on guests - banning all non-essential, social visits to homes even between relatives. Premier Daniel Andrews has spoken of a recent dinner party in Victoria at which one person was infected with COVID-19 at the start and several guests had come down with the new illness by the end. In NSW, the position is similar. There are 16 excuses for leaving your home but none of them involve dinner parties, barbecues or beers with mates (see the list below). In Queensland, social visits are allowed for up to two visitors to each household, although strangers can't visit. Tasmania and the ACT still also let you have up to two visitors as long as you are following social distancing measures – allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In WA, social visits are strongly discouraged but not banned outright. (We are still seeking clarification on this.) In South Australia and the Northern Territory, socialising is discouraged but gatherings are limited to 10. Here's something else to bear in mind when deciding what to do: people over 70 and people with a chronic illness, including common conditions such as high blood pressure, are particularly susceptible to complications, even death, from the virus. Every visit brings with it the chance of infection, and some carriers are asymptomatic too – you may not know you are carrying the virus. This was briefly a vexed issue in Victoria and NSW because social visits are otherwise banned. Victoria quickly backed down on its ""bonk ban"", after advising on April 1 that people should not visit or be intimate with partners they didn't live with. Within hours, it had made a specific exemption for romantic couples. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route: he said visiting a partner fell under the category of ""care"", which is one of the 16 reasonable excuses (listed above) for not staying home. ""Mental health,"" he said, ""we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you."" In the other states and territories, visitors can include partners. People can visit as carer.Credit:  While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear – although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. In NSW, the government has yet to clarify this. Victoria has said its own rules allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. 'It’s not smart and it’s not right,' said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews about grandparents babysitting. Still, older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia's chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of the case of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  Yes, but only if it's essential (this is no time for a backyard blitz) and while keeping your distance. In NSW, as we've seen above, cleaning will fall under caring when it's for someone vulnerable. In Victoria, if you are unwell, disabled, elderly or pregnant you can have a service provider or tradie over ""if you really need help"". ""For example,"" the government advice says, ""your Wi-Fi might be faulty and you need it to work from home. Or, you might have a leaking pipe causing damage. A tradesperson is permitted to enter your home to fix the problem, but you must ensure physical distancing while they are there."" Similarly, house cleaners are framed in the guidelines as being for those who need help, physically. If you're helping an elderly friend or relative who lives alone with cleaning and housework, the government advises, think about having them sit somewhere comfortable and away from you while you work. For the rest of us, it might be time to dust off the feather duster. In Queensland, the limit of two visitors is not affected by someone who's at the house to work (for example, a cleaner, a nanny or tradesperson), according to guidelines. ""This means for example, three tradespeople could be at your house to do repairs, and you can still have a close friend at your house, with your regular household members."" Safe Work Australia is advising cleaners and tradespeople to maintain physical distance at all times in homes. No mucking around! Make beach visits quick and for exercise. And check whether a beach is open before you head out.Credit:  Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has kept going for morning walks every day during the crisis. Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has mentioned taking a 20-minute evening constitutional around his neighbourhood. As the Prime Minister has said, exercise is one of the four acceptable reasons to be out of your home. Exercise can be with one other person so long as you keep 1.5 metres distance from one another. While group boot camps are out, you can walk, jog, cycle or do push-ups with your household or someone external, including a personal trainer, as long as it's just the two of you. You could even grab a takeaway coffee but, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged, keep moving – the aim is to avoid people clustering together, and NSW Police have stressed that people hanging about will attract their attraction. Note that the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services has said: ""Recreational exercise such as fishing, hunting, boating, golf and other activities that go beyond basic exercise, are not allowed."" If you keep the word ""essential"" in mind, then rambling Sunday drives or road trips where you pop out of the car right at the end to stretch your legs are not on right now. In fact, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has told ABC Radio the Easter long weekend is not an excuse for people to travel just anywhere and people should not be going for a drive – even if they have no intention of getting out of the car. In Victoria, Police Minister Lisa Neville has urged people to exercise in their local community and not travel to the coast for a surf, walk or swim even if a beach is open. Surfing, swimming and walking are all permitted on beaches but, while driving the 20 minutes from Aireys Inlet to Lorne would be reasonable, driving the two hours from Melbourne to Lorne would be ""inappropriate"".  Police rescinded a fine for a man who was driving half-an-hour to go mountain biking alone – at the nearest track to his home. Driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable. (Given the two-person rule, you could conceivably meet someone from another household at your destination but you should not drive there together.) In Queensland, those considering travelling to walk on a beach should think again: beaches are accessible only to people who live in the immediate area, with police signalling they will step up random ID checks over the Easter weekend. People are not allowed to travel, for example, from Brisbane to the Gold Coast to visit the beach, and will be fined if police do spot checks. Border controls are in force in Queensland too and more than 900 cars had been turned around by April 8. Within WA too, if you drive far enough, you might come up against one of the around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among the state's nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down for all but essential services. See details below. L-platers: depends where you live.Credit:  That depends on where you live. NSW Police have issued a statement saying learning to drive with a household member is considered a reasonable excuse to leave home ""given that this is a learning activity that cannot be done from home and is akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Victoria has come down differently on the issue. A learner driver made news recently after she was fined $1652 for practising driving with her mother, which police said was ""non-essential"". Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton later acknowledged this was not a fair fine because the rules were unclear and there was no precedent. But Victorian authorities stand by the fact that a driving lesson is not essential, and Patton has said any future cases will be fined. An L-plater can drive for essential activities, such as buying food or for medical care. In Queensland, the Chief Health Officer's direction is to only undertake essential travel. So, again, you could supervise your child driving to and from these essential activities. The WA government is recommending all learner driver lessons, outside essential travel, also be deferred for now but the transport department is ""prioritising driving tests for emergency services and personnel and for heavy vehicles to keep the freight industry operating"". Easter holidays? Stay home. Credit:  Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"". An influx of visitors to holiday spots exposes communities in those areas to infection and could strain local medical services if someone becomes ill. In Victoria, Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton has said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for food and other essentials; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. In NSW, taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse to be moving about. A man told 3AW radio on April 7 he had received a $1652 fine for non-essential travel after visiting his beach house on the Mornington Peninsula to check its security. ""I went down by myself. On the way home, I thought, I'll make a little detour and get rid of an empty gas bottle …"" he said. Towing a caravan and setting it up somewhere is also out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental. ""You should be cancelling your booking for the Easter weekend. If you've booked an Airbnb, you should be staying home in your permanent residence,"" Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said. Airbnb have cancellation policies in place that allow you to cancel and get a full refund if you booked before March 14.  In NSW, the public health orders specifically spell it out: ""Taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse."" And NSW Police have explicitly said not to go on holidays. They've even revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. Short-term rentals such as Air BnBs can be used for work, education or for caring purposes but not for holidaying. In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, ""Easter holidays are cancelled this year"". Queensland police have strongly suggested they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. If you are able to make a convincing case that your travel is for essential purposes, such as for work, that might be fine but if the ""work"" is simply mowing the yard or so on then it is not advisable. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. You couldn't travel from Perth to a holiday home in, say, Dunsborough, in the South West region, unless you were an essential worker or travelling on compassionate grounds. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. While you can't go to church, some Easter services are being broadcast on television and some are being ""live-streamed"", which means you can watch them on your computer broadcast in real time. Of course, there won't be any parishioners, just the priest and whoever is needed to film the service. Search online for details. Yes if you have to. You can even have removalists but you must adhere to physical distancing rules. You bet. In every state and territory, blood donations are exempt from the current restrictions. Fishing? It depends where you live.Credit:  ""No one likes playing golf more than I do,"" Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said. ""You might want to play golf but you don't need to play golf. No round of golf is worth someone's life."" Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has ruled out not just golf but fishing, boating, hunting, camping and ""all recreational activity beyond basic exercise"". ""Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your [golf] clubs at home."" In NSW, hunting is suspended but fishing is OK – the Department of Primary Industries characterises it as exercise. Golf is fine, too. (Golf courses were initially closed on advice of the federal government but, after reconsideration, the NSW Office of Sport deemed golf an activity that can be played in line with Public Health Orders.) And so is boating. A ""reasonable excuse"" to use your boat could be to exercise (for example, kayaking, sailing, paddling); fish; get to and from work when you can't work from home; get groceries; and provide help or care to an immediate member of the person's family. Again, social distancing rules always apply – at the boat ramp and on your boat. You should be in your boat alone or with just one other person; or with family who ordinarily live in the same household as you. In Queensland, even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. Golf is good in Queensland as long as it is with just two people who are physically distant. Boating was banned but now boaties can locally fish or travel for food but not recreation (it's not clear where this leaves anglers). Other forms of water sports, including kayaking and paddleboarding, are also still allowed in Queensland, and state-run boat ramps remain open. Even so, the federal provisions limiting public gatherings to two people or less still apply, and even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. WA has not expressly banned recreational fishing or boating but fishers have been encouraged to stay at home and recreational fishing body Recfishwest says you should head out only for essential food gathering. Golf is OK, though. Some clubs are open and some have opted to shut. You have to play in a one or a two, physically distancing as you go, and call the club first, both to see if they're open and to get an allocated tee-time. The ACT has banned all outdoor recreation beyond exercise as non-essential. You can do these things, if it's essential or for compassionate reasons (say, you physically cannot wash and style your own hair) but governments strongly urge people aged 70 or over, or 60 with chronic medical conditions, to avoid contact because they are at higher risk of complications or death from COVID-19. So, while banks and hairdressers are deemed essential services and remain open, it's better if you speak to your bank over the telephone and see how they can assist you; or potentially request that a hairdresser visit you at home; or find a relative, carer or support person who can help you. Now is the time to prevail on others. You can phone the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 for more information. Victoria's Council on the Ageing has a phone hotline from 9.30am until 4pm on 1300 135 090. In Queensland, the Community Recovery Hotline, a free call on 1800 173 349, will link seniors and other vulnerable Queenslanders to essential services and support. If you want to talk through how you are feeling and gain advice and support to suit your circumstances, phone Beyond Blue's new Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Service on 1800 512 348. WA Police have set up around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among WA’s nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down, meaning any person who is outside the region can only enter if: People who cross into another region without valid reasons could face a $50,000 fine. A hard state border closure is also in force. Anyone seeking to come into WA will now be turned away unless they have a valid exemption. Who is exempt from the border closure?  There will also be exemptions for fly-in-fly-out workers and their families but strict 14-day quarantine measures will need to be followed, paid for by the industry. So anyone travelling from interstate or overseas will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, and anyone who does not adhere to this law can be prosecuted.   People in WA will be allowed through road blocks if they want to donate blood. It is exempt from the current restrictions in all states and territories. As of April 7, NSW Police have issued 122 personal infringement notices under the Public Health Act since March 17. Among the latest was an off-duty policewoman who was observed allegedly drunk on a city street being assisted by a man. She later told police she had been at a nearby apartment with others including another off-duty policeman. Five people in total were issued infringement notices resulting from the incident. In Victoria, police have issued more than 500 fines for breaches of coronavirus lockdown rules. Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said police have been directed to only give fines for ""deliberate, obvious and blatant breaches"" and to use a ""common-sense approach"". Clear examples include Airbnb parties with 20 guests, where every attendee was fined; a seven-person dinner party at a house; three friends playing video games in a loungeroom who did not live together; a group of friends hanging out in a park; and four people walking the streets seeking drugs. There have been grey areas. Police have rescinded fines for a man booked for driving to go mountain biking alone – driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable and it was the closest bike track to his home. And there was the 17-year-old L-plater whose fine for having a driving lesson with her mum was later rescinded, although police have clarified that driving lessons are non-essential moving forward and so you can be fined for them. In Queensland, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned that police would step up fines after seeing images of a bustling farmers' market on April 4 where patrons had ignored social distancing rules. In the same weekend, police went on to issue 132 fines for $1334, including to 58 people at one car rally in Rochedale. By April 8, police had given out 208 fines, including to five people on April 7 for partying at a Sunshine Coast hotel, claiming they did not know about the social distancing requirements. In WA, drones with lights, sirens and speakers have been brought in to deter people from breaking the rules and there are new on-the-spot $1000 fines for anyone found to be flouting them. According to Premier Mark McGowan, by April 8 three infringements had been issued and eight people had been summoned for breaching directives such as quarantine and self-isolation rules. – with Michael Fowler, Marta Pascual Juanola, Rachel Eddie If you'd like some expert background on an issue or a news event, drop us a line at explainers@smh.com.au or explainers@theage.com.au.

71,/national/stop-looking-for-loopholes-what-are-the-new-covid-19-social-rules-20200407-p54hyd.html,'Stop looking for loopholes': What are the new COVID-19 social rules?,"Guests are pinged for being at a dinner party. Five young people in a car are fined for driving around aimlessly together. Three friends are fined for playing video games in a loungeroom. All had breached laws aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. In our new reality during the COVID-19 pandemic, no matter where you live in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has advised there are really only four acceptable reasons to go out: Bottom line: ""Only leave for what you need + exercise, work, medical and care,"" as federal government text messages are saying. Sound a bit full-on? So are the potential consequences of getting COVID-19. The idea of these rules is to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus by limiting contact with others, thereby flattening the rate of infections and ensuring our hospitals are not overwhelmed. So far, Australians have been doing a good job of following the rules. The number of new infections recorded every day is falling. But our medical experts have warned now is ""not the time to take the foot off the brake"" – complacency could see Australia lose its window to contain the outbreak, and cases rapidly explode again. As questions from you flood into police, governments – and our newsrooms – about what will and won't get you fined on the spot, we've scoured guidelines and public comments from leaders, and put your questions to governments and the police. Here is what we know so far. In all states, you can still visit someone in an emergency or to provide care – or even drop off supplies. But when it comes to social visits to households, it's the unnecessary guests that are now advised against, even if you live alone. Spending time together inside a house, as opposed to on a walk outside (1.5 metres apart), gives the virus more opportunities to spread in bathrooms and kitchens. Victoria has taken one of the tougher lines on guests - banning all non-essential, social visits to homes even between relatives. Premier Daniel Andrews has spoken of a recent dinner party in Victoria at which one person was infected with COVID-19 at the start and several guests had come down with the new illness by the end. In NSW, the position is similar. There are 16 excuses for leaving your home but none of them involve dinner parties, barbecues or beers with mates (see the list below). In Queensland, social visits are allowed for up to two visitors to each household, although strangers can't visit. Tasmania and the ACT still also let you have up to two visitors as long as you are following social distancing measures – allowing space for one person per four square metres. (So if you live in a tiny apartment you might still have to reconsider guests). In WA, social visits are strongly discouraged but not banned outright. (We are still seeking clarification on this.) In South Australia and the Northern Territory, socialising is discouraged but gatherings are limited to 10. Here's something else to bear in mind when deciding what to do: people over 70 and people with a chronic illness, including common conditions such as high blood pressure, are particularly susceptible to complications, even death, from the virus. Every visit brings with it the chance of infection, and some carriers are asymptomatic too – you may not know you are carrying the virus. This was briefly a vexed issue in Victoria and NSW because social visits are otherwise banned. Victoria quickly backed down on its ""bonk ban"", after advising on April 1 that people should not visit or be intimate with partners they didn't live with. Within hours, it had made a specific exemption for romantic couples. NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller came to the same conclusion by a different route: he said visiting a partner fell under the category of ""care"", which is one of the 16 reasonable excuses (listed above) for not staying home. ""Mental health,"" he said, ""we get it ... we need to look after each other – but don't take the whole family with you."" In the other states and territories, visitors can include partners. People can visit as carer.Credit:  While child custody arrangements remain unaffected by the restrictions, the rules around babysitting are less clear – although it appears to fall under either care or work in most states. In NSW, the government has yet to clarify this. Victoria has said its own rules allow you to have someone over to care for children if you need to leave the house for one of the four essential reasons above, or if you are working or studying from home. 'It’s not smart and it’s not right,' said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews about grandparents babysitting. Still, older or Indigenous Australians and those with chronic conditions have been advised by medical experts, including Australia's chief health officers, to stay home where they can and limit contact with relatives, even grandchildren. ""Sadly, I don't think grandparents can be drafted in for very much at all,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said when asked about babysitting. ""It is simply not smart, not right for us to be putting those people at risk."" He acknowledged this was often painful for people, speaking of the case of a new grandparent who had been unable to meet their grandson since the pandemic hit.  Yes, but only if it's essential (this is no time for a backyard blitz) and while keeping your distance. In NSW, as we've seen above, cleaning will fall under caring when it's for someone vulnerable. In Victoria, if you are unwell, disabled, elderly or pregnant you can have a service provider or tradie over ""if you really need help"". ""For example,"" the government advice says, ""your Wi-Fi might be faulty and you need it to work from home. Or, you might have a leaking pipe causing damage. A tradesperson is permitted to enter your home to fix the problem, but you must ensure physical distancing while they are there."" Similarly, house cleaners are framed in the guidelines as being for those who need help, physically. If you're helping an elderly friend or relative who lives alone with cleaning and housework, the government advises, think about having them sit somewhere comfortable and away from you while you work. For the rest of us, it might be time to dust off the feather duster. In Queensland, the limit of two visitors is not affected by someone who's at the house to work (for example, a cleaner, a nanny or tradesperson), according to guidelines. ""This means for example, three tradespeople could be at your house to do repairs, and you can still have a close friend at your house, with your regular household members."" Safe Work Australia is advising cleaners and tradespeople to maintain physical distance at all times in homes. No mucking around! Make beach visits quick and for exercise. And check whether a beach is open before you head out.Credit:  Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has kept going for morning walks every day during the crisis. Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has mentioned taking a 20-minute evening constitutional around his neighbourhood. As the Prime Minister has said, exercise is one of the four acceptable reasons to be out of your home. Exercise can be with one other person so long as you keep 1.5 metres distance from one another. While group boot camps are out, you can walk, jog, cycle or do push-ups with your household or someone external, including a personal trainer, as long as it's just the two of you. You could even grab a takeaway coffee but, as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has urged, keep moving – the aim is to avoid people clustering together, and NSW Police have stressed that people hanging about will attract their attraction. Note that the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services has said: ""Recreational exercise such as fishing, hunting, boating, golf and other activities that go beyond basic exercise, are not allowed."" If you keep the word ""essential"" in mind, then rambling Sunday drives or road trips where you pop out of the car right at the end to stretch your legs are not on right now. In fact, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has told ABC Radio the Easter long weekend is not an excuse for people to travel just anywhere and people should not be going for a drive – even if they have no intention of getting out of the car. In Victoria, Police Minister Lisa Neville has urged people to exercise in their local community and not travel to the coast for a surf, walk or swim even if a beach is open. Surfing, swimming and walking are all permitted on beaches but, while driving the 20 minutes from Aireys Inlet to Lorne would be reasonable, driving the two hours from Melbourne to Lorne would be ""inappropriate"".  Police rescinded a fine for a man who was driving half-an-hour to go mountain biking alone – at the nearest track to his home. Driving to an exercise spot alone is acceptable. (Given the two-person rule, you could conceivably meet someone from another household at your destination but you should not drive there together.) In Queensland, those considering travelling to walk on a beach should think again: beaches are accessible only to people who live in the immediate area, with police signalling they will step up random ID checks over the Easter weekend. People are not allowed to travel, for example, from Brisbane to the Gold Coast to visit the beach, and will be fined if police do spot checks. Border controls are in force in Queensland too and more than 900 cars had been turned around by April 8. Within WA too, if you drive far enough, you might come up against one of the around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among the state's nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down for all but essential services. See details below. L-platers: depends where you live.Credit:  That depends on where you live. NSW Police have issued a statement saying learning to drive with a household member is considered a reasonable excuse to leave home ""given that this is a learning activity that cannot be done from home and is akin to the listed reasonable excuse of travelling to attend an educational institution where you cannot learn from home"". Victoria has come down differently on the issue. A learner driver made news recently after she was fined $1652 for practising driving with her mother, which police said was ""non-essential"". Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton later acknowledged this was not a fair fine because the rules were unclear and there was no precedent. But Victorian authorities stand by the fact that a driving lesson is not essential, and Patton has said any future cases will be fined. An L-plater can drive for essential activities, such as buying food or for medical care. In Queensland, the Chief Health Officer's direction is to only undertake essential travel. So, again, you could supervise your child driving to and from these essential activities. The WA government is recommending all learner driver lessons, outside essential travel, also be deferred for now but the transport department is ""prioritising driving tests for emergency services and personnel and for heavy vehicles to keep the freight industry operating"". Easter holidays? Stay home. Credit:  Sorry. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told Australians to stay at home this Easter weekend, saying failure to do so ""would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together"". An influx of visitors to holiday spots exposes communities in those areas to infection and could strain local medical services if someone becomes ill. In Victoria, Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton has said that if people have more than one ""ordinary place of residence"" then they can move between them. ""You got a holiday house? You can go to that,"" he told 3AW radio. But go there, go straight there and stay there, only going out for one of the four valid reasons – to shop for food and other essentials; to access medical services or provide caregiving; to go to work or education; and to exercise – or you can be fined. In NSW, taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse to be moving about. A man told 3AW radio on April 7 he had received a $1652 fine for non-essential travel after visiting his beach house on the Mornington Peninsula to check its security. ""I went down by myself. On the way home, I thought, I'll make a little detour and get rid of an empty gas bottle …"" he said. Towing a caravan and setting it up somewhere is also out in Victoria – and an ordinary place of residence is not a short-term holiday rental. ""You should be cancelling your booking for the Easter weekend. If you've booked an Airbnb, you should be staying home in your permanent residence,"" Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said. Airbnb have cancellation policies in place that allow you to cancel and get a full refund if you booked before March 14.  In NSW, the public health orders specifically spell it out: ""Taking a holiday in a regional area is not a reasonable excuse."" And NSW Police have explicitly said not to go on holidays. They've even revealed they will be using number plate recognition technology to patrol highways and caravan parks over the Easter weekend. Short-term rentals such as Air BnBs can be used for work, education or for caring purposes but not for holidaying. In Queensland, which has also closed its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has gone so far as to say, ""Easter holidays are cancelled this year"". Queensland police have strongly suggested they will issue an on-the-spot fines of $1334 to people travelling to a second house for no good reason, such as a holiday house or apartment near a beach. If you are able to make a convincing case that your travel is for essential purposes, such as for work, that might be fine but if the ""work"" is simply mowing the yard or so on then it is not advisable. In WA, the state has not only closed its borders but has broken up the state into nine regions - drivers cannot pass beyond those checkpoints without a valid reason. You couldn't travel from Perth to a holiday home in, say, Dunsborough, in the South West region, unless you were an essential worker or travelling on compassionate grounds. Meanwhile, South Australia and the ACT have warned people not to pitch tents in national parks or travel to coastal or regional communities. While you can't go to church, some Easter services are being broadcast on television and some are being ""live-streamed"", which means you can watch them on your computer broadcast in real time. Of course, there won't be any parishioners, just the priest and whoever is needed to film the service. Search online for details. Yes if you have to. You can even have removalists but you must adhere to physical distancing rules. You bet. In every state and territory, blood donations are exempt from the current restrictions. Fishing? It depends where you live.Credit:  ""No one likes playing golf more than I do,"" Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews has said. ""You might want to play golf but you don't need to play golf. No round of golf is worth someone's life."" Victoria's Chief Medical Officer, Brett Sutton, has ruled out not just golf but fishing, boating, hunting, camping and ""all recreational activity beyond basic exercise"". ""Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your [golf] clubs at home."" In NSW, hunting is suspended but fishing is OK – the Department of Primary Industries characterises it as exercise. Golf is fine, too. (Golf courses were initially closed on advice of the federal government but, after reconsideration, the NSW Office of Sport deemed golf an activity that can be played in line with Public Health Orders.) And so is boating. A ""reasonable excuse"" to use your boat could be to exercise (for example, kayaking, sailing, paddling); fish; get to and from work when you can't work from home; get groceries; and provide help or care to an immediate member of the person's family. Again, social distancing rules always apply – at the boat ramp and on your boat. You should be in your boat alone or with just one other person; or with family who ordinarily live in the same household as you. In Queensland, even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. Golf is good in Queensland as long as it is with just two people who are physically distant. Boating was banned but now boaties can locally fish or travel for food but not recreation (it's not clear where this leaves anglers). Other forms of water sports, including kayaking and paddleboarding, are also still allowed in Queensland, and state-run boat ramps remain open. Even so, the federal provisions limiting public gatherings to two people or less still apply, and even if two people are in a tinnie they are still required to socially distance. WA has not expressly banned recreational fishing or boating but fishers have been encouraged to stay at home and recreational fishing body Recfishwest says you should head out only for essential food gathering. Golf is OK, though. Some clubs are open and some have opted to shut. You have to play in a one or a two, physically distancing as you go, and call the club first, both to see if they're open and to get an allocated tee-time. The ACT has banned all outdoor recreation beyond exercise as non-essential. You can do these things, if it's essential or for compassionate reasons (say, you physically cannot wash and style your own hair) but governments strongly urge people aged 70 or over, or 60 with chronic medical conditions, to avoid contact because they are at higher risk of complications or death from COVID-19. So, while banks and hairdressers are deemed essential services and remain open, it's better if you speak to your bank over the telephone and see how they can assist you; or potentially request that a hairdresser visit you at home; or find a relative, carer or support person who can help you. Now is the time to prevail on others. You can phone the Coronavirus Hotline on 1800 675 398 for more information. Victoria's Council on the Ageing has a phone hotline from 9.30am until 4pm on 1300 135 090. In Queensland, the Community Recovery Hotline, a free call on 1800 173 349, will link seniors and other vulnerable Queenslanders to essential services and support. If you want to talk through how you are feeling and gain advice and support to suit your circumstances, phone Beyond Blue's new Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Service on 1800 512 348. WA Police have set up around-the-clock checkpoints and mobile policing among WA’s nine major regions. The Kimberley and Goldfields-Esperance regions have been completely locked down, meaning any person who is outside the region can only enter if: People who cross into another region without valid reasons could face a $50,000 fine. A hard state border closure is also in force. Anyone seeking to come into WA will now be turned away unless they have a valid exemption. Who is exempt from the border closure?  There will also be exemptions for fly-in-fly-out workers and their families but strict 14-day quarantine measures will need to be followed, paid for by the industry. So anyone travelling from interstate or overseas will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival, and anyone who does not adhere to this law can be prosecuted.   People in WA will be allowed through road blocks if they want to donate blood. It is exempt from the current restrictions in all states and territories. As of April 7, NSW Police have issued 122 personal infringement notices under the Public Health Act since March 17. Among the latest was an off-duty policewoman who was observed allegedly drunk on a city street being assisted by a man.

Clear examples include Airbnb parties with 20 guests, where every attendee was fined; a seven-person dinner party at a house; three friends playing video games in a loungeroom who did not live together; a group of friends hanging out in a park; and four people walking the streets seeking drugs.

72,/national/the-two-factors-concerning-experts-as-new-covid-19-cases-begin-to-fall-20200406-p54hhm.html,The two factors concerning experts as new COVID-19 cases begin to fall,"The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on Monday was the lowest in nearly three weeks but experts are divided on whether Australia has flattened the curve, after the number of deaths jumped over the weekend and the proportion of cases with an unknown source continued to rise in NSW. There were 108 new cases reported nationally on Monday, down from 139 on Sunday and 324 on Saturday, but the number of deaths surged by nearly 78 per cent per cent since Thursday. A total of 18 deaths have been reported since Thursday, bringing the national toll to 41. ""The ultimate sign that [the curve was flattening] would be the number of deaths but the good thing in Australia is that total deaths is very low compared to other countries, and because the number is so small it can bounce around a lot,"" professorial research fellow at Victoria University and former World Health Organisation staff member Maximilian de Courten said. He said the latest deaths also reflect case numbers from previous weeks, rather than the present situation. ""The trend in a fall in the number of new cases will translate to fewer deaths in two weeks. Nobody wants to call it too early but [the numbers] look encouraging."" The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on Monday was the lowest in nearly three weeks but experts are divided on whether Australia has flattened the curve.Credit:Rhett Wyman However, Stephen Leeder, a public health professor at the University of Sydney, said case figures could easily start to rise again. ""There's a lot of fluctuation in the figures and it depends a lot on the rate of testing and other factors,"" Professor Leeder said. The number of new cases reported daily has dropped at regular intervals in the past month before surging again. There has been a more sustained fall in the number of new cases in NSW since late-March but Professor de Courten said the growing proportion of cases with an unknown source of infection was concerning. Nearly 400 of the 2640 cases recorded in NSW by Sunday were locally acquired and had no known links to any other confirmed case or cluster, representing 15 per cent of the state's total cases. This proportion has been rising steadily for the past two weeks, from 9 per cent on March 24. In comparison, only 6.6 per cent of all cases in Victoria had an unknown source of infection by Sunday. ""Public health experts have a keen eye on NSW and why that figure is higher, and whether that's [trending up] or coming under control,"" Professor de Courten said. ""For that reason we still hold our breath. If community spread decreases, that means we're becoming more efficient in testing and identifying cases."" Additionally, although the number of new cases in NSW has trended down for about a week, the average number of new tests conducted every day so far this month has fallen to 2700, from nearly 4000 per day last month. The number of total cases as a proportion of total tests conducted in NSW has continued to grow since early-March and was at 2.13 per cent on Sunday. NSW Health did not respond to questions about why the number of new daily tests has fallen.

73,/national/the-two-factors-concerning-experts-as-new-covid-19-cases-begin-to-fall-20200406-p54hhm.html,The two factors concerning experts as new COVID-19 cases begin to fall,"The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on Monday was the lowest in nearly three weeks but experts are divided on whether Australia has flattened the curve, after the number of deaths jumped over the weekend and the proportion of cases with an unknown source continued to rise in NSW. There were 108 new cases reported nationally on Monday, down from 139 on Sunday and 324 on Saturday, but the number of deaths surged by nearly 78 per cent per cent since Thursday. A total of 18 deaths have been reported since Thursday, bringing the national toll to 41. ""The ultimate sign that [the curve was flattening] would be the number of deaths but the good thing in Australia is that total deaths is very low compared to other countries, and because the number is so small it can bounce around a lot,"" professorial research fellow at Victoria University and former World Health Organisation staff member Maximilian de Courten said. He said the latest deaths also reflect case numbers from previous weeks, rather than the present situation. ""The trend in a fall in the number of new cases will translate to fewer deaths in two weeks. Nobody wants to call it too early but [the numbers] look encouraging."" The number of new COVID-19 cases reported on Monday was the lowest in nearly three weeks but experts are divided on whether Australia has flattened the curve.Credit:Rhett Wyman However, Stephen Leeder, a public health professor at the University of Sydney, said case figures could easily start to rise again. ""There's a lot of fluctuation in the figures and it depends a lot on the rate of testing and other factors,"" Professor Leeder said. The number of new cases reported daily has dropped at regular intervals in the past month before surging again. There has been a more sustained fall in the number of new cases in NSW since late-March but Professor de Courten said the growing proportion of cases with an unknown source of infection was concerning. Nearly 400 of the 2640 cases recorded in NSW by Sunday were locally acquired and had no known links to any other confirmed case or cluster, representing 15 per cent of the state's total cases. This proportion has been rising steadily for the past two weeks, from 9 per cent on March 24. In comparison, only 6.6 per cent of all cases in Victoria had an unknown source of infection by Sunday. ""Public health experts have a keen eye on NSW and why that figure is higher, and whether that's [trending up] or coming under control,"" Professor de Courten said. ""For that reason we still hold our breath. If community spread decreases, that means we're becoming more efficient in testing and identifying cases."" Additionally, although the number of new cases in NSW has trended down for about a week, the average number of new tests conducted every day so far this month has fallen to 2700, from nearly 4000 per day last month. The number of total cases as a proportion of total tests conducted in NSW has continued to grow since early-March and was at 2.13 per cent on Sunday. NSW Health did not respond to questions about why the number of new daily tests has fallen. Professor Leeder said the response to the pandemic has ""been handled remarkably well"" by governments and the community in Australia. Australia's infection curve also compares well to other countries such as the US and the UK, which are ""still on a very steep increase"", Professor de Courten said.

74,/business/the-economy/where-will-all-the-money-come-from-to-fund-the-stimulus-20200403-p54goi.html,Where will all the money come from to fund the stimulus?,"The Morrison government has unleashed stimulus worth more than $200 billion in a bid to save Australia from a very deep and prolonged coronavirus-induced recession. Announcing this week's $130-billion wage subsidy for workers, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg justified the spending by declaring: “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.” But where is all this money coming from? Was it sitting there all along? Who will we have to repay when all this is over? And will we ever get the budget back into black? Understanding what is about to happen to the government's budget requires a basic knowledge of a few things. The federal government has a commitment, over the long run, to balance incoming money from tax collections with outgoing spending on welfare, health services etc. When the government raises more revenue than it spends in a year - for example because a mining boom has turbocharged company tax collections - its budget is said to be in surplus. These surplus funds can then be used to pay down any existing debt. When the Morrison government boasted of getting the budget ""back into black"", it only ever meant that it was going to start running annual budget surpluses – not that it had eliminated debt altogether. In fact, Australian governments have never completely paid off debts accumulated in previous downturns and crises, according to Deloitte Access Economic's Chris Richardson. It's just that economic growth has been so rapid as to dwarf the size of the debt relative to our national income. ""We have always had debt,"" says Richardson. Debt is incurred when government spends more money than it raises in a year – either because revenue has fallen short or spending demands have risen, or both – and the budget falls into deficit. In order to be able to keep paying its regular incoming bills – such as public service wages – the government must borrow to fund any shortfall, adding to any existing pile of debt. Prior to the global financial crisis, the Howard government had managed to reduce Australia's net debt to effectively zero, thanks to the mining boom. After a decade of running big deficits, however, Australian government debt today is, in dollar terms, higher than at any other time in history. As a percentage of our economy, however, net debt is about where it was in the mid-1990s in the aftermath of the early '90s recession. Last financial year, Australian government net debt stood at $373 billion or 19.2 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares favourably to other nations. Both the United Kingdom and the United States carry net government debt worth about 80 per cent of their economies. At the time of the last budget, the Australian government was forecasting it would achieve a budget surplus this financial year and use the surplus funds to pay down net debt to $360 billion, or 18 per cent of GDP. Now, however, net debt can be expected to top half a trillion dollars. On level three of the Treasury building in Canberra's parliamentary triangle, sits a group of people known as the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM). These people are the government's debt managers. Essentially, they act as intermediaries between the government and its potential lenders. Every couple of days, depending on requirements, they set up online auctions for things called government bonds. These bonds are essentially government promises to repay borrowed money, plus interest, to investors. Investors lodge bids to buy these bonds by indicating what interest rate they will accept, and it's all over in minutes. As of April 3, the AOFM had $579.2 billion of these bonds on issue to investors. We call this the level of Australia's gross debt, with net debt figures much lower, reflecting the offsetting value of various assets also held by the government. In order to fund the stimulus package, the Australian government will simply instruct the AOFM to conduct more frequent and larger auctions of these bonds. As a result, the level of outstanding government debt will go up and so too will the total interest bill that must be paid out. So who buys these bonds? According to the AOFM, just over half of Australian government bonds are held by non-residents. These include foreign banks, central banks and investors, including big pension funds. Even during a crisis, big global pension funds continue to receive a steady stream of contributions from workers and they need somewhere to park the money. The remainder is held by Australian entities, including banks, super funds and other institutional investors. The Reserve Bank has also started to purchase Australian government bonds. It is seeking to keep interest rates low by adding to demand for such bonds. The Reserve has said it will not buy bond directly at the AOFM auctions, to avoid crowding out other lenders, but will instead pick them up in the secondary market. Ultimately, however, we can expect the central bank to become a bigger owner of Australian government bonds. The good news is that debt is very cheap at the moment because interest rates are low. It has been observed that the world has a savings glut of money looking for attractive investment returns, of which, given increased risk aversion in the post-GFC era, there have not been a lot. So far, AOFM auctions for Australian government bonds have tended to be oversubscribed. So, while the value of Australian government debt in dollar terms is historically high, the interest bill on that debt as a proportion of the broader economy is not. The government paid $14 billion in net interest payments on its borrowings last financial year. But as a per cent of GDP, net interest payments were just 0.7 per cent of GDP, compared to 1.7 per cent in the aftermath of the early 1980s and early 1990s recessions. With interest rates as low as they can go, however, and debt set to soar, that interest bill will rise. Slowly, over time. When the virus has run its course, and particularly if the stimulus has been successful in protecting jobs, we can expect spending needs to subside and economic activity to lift, producing more tax revenue. When we start to run budget surpluses again, we can start to pay down the accumulated debt. This may take a very long time. But it is not impossible. The mining boom of the 2000s helped the Howard government restore the budget to balance after the 1990s recession. Chris Richardson is keen to dispel the idea that borrowing today will impose an unfair burden on future generations. With interests rate so low, the interest bill on the additional $213 billion of borrowings will be just $1.6 billion a year. ""That’s not nothing,"" says Richardson. ""You’d much prefer not to have to pay that much extra in interest every year ... Yet these costs are far from scary."" Were, however, the government to fail to act to counteract this economic crisis, Richardson fears the budget – and nation – could end up in a much worse state, as joblessness soars, revenue plummets and welfare costs soar. Richardson says Australia must now be on a war footing: ""Australia’s economy will grow again on the other side of this war. So, here’s a simple suggestion: let’s just let our debts from this new war simply become a smaller share of our growing economy over time. That’s what we did with the war-time debts of the past. And it’s probably the smart play this time too."" ""There are lots of things to be scared of,"" concludes Richardson. ""The fight for our health is a long way from being won. But don’t be scared of the debt – its costs aren’t that bad. And chances are that taking on this debt will be a great investment in Australian livelihoods.""

MasterChef's free-wheeling new judges Melissa Leong, Jock Zonfrillo and Andy Allen.Credit:Network Ten As reliable a fixture of the TV calendar as mushrooms in autumn, the cooking competition that changed the way Australia eats is back. And this time it’s packing relatable, do-try-this-at-home comfort. “We’re not seeing trends being picked up where everyone is doing exactly the same food in exactly the same style,” says judge Melissa Leong, a food writer and judge from SBS’ The Chefs’ Line. “What the world needs now is the ability to be comfortable with who we are, both in ourselves and in our food, and this season has that in spades.” Leong and fellow judges Andy Allen and Jock Zonfrillo aren’t household names (qualifier: yet) but the Endemol producers have left no stone unturned in ensuring the show’s 2020 reboot minus the familiar faces of Matt Preston, Gary Mehigan and George Calombaris stands its best chance in the prime-time arms race. Paving the way for Australia’s acceptance of the new judging troika, MasterChef Australia: Back To Win reintroduces 24 of the higher-profile alumni from previous seasons, among them Poh Ling Leow, Hayden Quinn, Dani Venn and Khanh Ong. “These are 24 contestants who are beloved and known by Australians and the global audience for MasterChef Australia and I think it’s a really smart move,” says Leong. “It does give us the opportunity for people to get to know us through that filter. It’s a fair indication of a high degree of intelligence from the brains trust at Endemol.” Past contestants and winners get a second chance in season 12 of MasterChef Australia.Credit:Network Ten More than a decade into MasterChef, the opportunity to breathe new life into the format has initiated other subtle yet important changes. Past seasons have led to instant spikes in sales of particular ingredients: goats’ cheese, for example, pork belly, and pink ling (just ask series sponsor Coles, which stocks the contestants’ pantry and gets instant market insights into what floats Australians’ gustatory boat). Zonfrillo, the restaurateur who has put native ingredients in the spotlight at his three-hatted Adelaide restaurant Orana, signed up with the intention to insinuate them into the everyday food conversation. This year we’ll see the Indigenous plants, proteins and spices he’s spent his career championing included as a matter of course in the contestants’ pantry. “It was my non-negotiable term,” says the Scottish-born chef. “The important thing was to make sure it wasn’t the standalone Indigenous episode, where it’s isolated out like some kind of leprosy. It had to be integrated into everyday MasterChef much like a carrot or an onion. I wanted it to be natural rather than a tokenistic ‘look at this’ teaching moment. It’s time it went to the next level and got into people’s homes.” Here come the judges: Jock Zonfrillo, Andy Allen, guest Gordon Ramsay and Melissa Leong in the new-look MasterChef.Credit:Network Ten Ingredients such as mountain pepper (“a basic spice people can use an alternative to black pepper”); lemon myrtle (“fantastic when you put a few leaves into a chicken roast”); and Geraldton wax (“It should be on the supermarket shelves, for Christ’s sake; it’s great in a stir-fry or braise”) are part of the MasterChef 2.0 mise-en-place. “It’s been emotional, coming into it not knowing if they’d reach for the ingredients,” says Zonfrillo, “but they did.” MasterChef 2.0 is also the perfect time to reflect on the capriciousness of fate. Andy Allen is the season-four winner who has become a restaurateur in his own right (he’s teamed up with the Sydney-based Three Blue Ducks stable). His appointment to the judges’ table marks him as one of the MasterChef graduates to have best capitalised on the media career prize fluttering from the confetti cannon. By way of comparison, his fellow season-four traveller Ben Milburn, with whom he filmed the SBS series Andy and Ben Eat Australia, is on the other side of the bench as a contestant. “A lot of eyes were on the choice of new judges,” says Allen. “I do feel humbled they picked me.” He’s been heartened by 2020s renewed focus on comfort cooking returning the franchise to its more accessible roots. “Last year I saw some things I never thought I’d see on TV, much less on MasterChef. There was an episode when they were in Japan and someone was cooking shabu shabu and I just thought, no one’s going to relate to that. This year it’s going back to real people serving real food with a lot of flavour. We’re not looking at pretty stuff for the sake of it.” This year’s viewers will not need to be eagle-eyed to notice the effects of the uninvited guest at the months-long dinner party. The arrival of COVID-19 forced a reset part-way through filming, cancelling the appearance of some international guest judges and modifying the typical challenge format. The cooking benches will be moved further apart, while for the judges there will be no more Gary, Matt and George-style eating off the same plate like a bunch of share-house mates. “Social distancing is very strange but we’re doing what we need to do,” says Leong. “It was funny to walk onto set and realise we can’t stand as close to each other and we can’t eat from the same plate. It’s impossible to ignore all the handwashing. But they can still make the show look and feel good.” As for anyone concerned that the nation’s talent pool of TV-ready amateur chefs has been swallowed up by endless MasterChef-inspired cooking competitions – well, you can take some coronavirus-inspired heart. “Who knows what people are doing with all this extra time at home?” says Leong. “They have YouTube, produce and a whole lot of time, so it bodes well for next year.” WHAT: MasterChef (new season) WHEN: Ten, from Monday, April 13 Larissa is a writer and reviewer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Dubecki ,"April 8, 2020"

Past seasons have led to instant spikes in sales of particular ingredients: goats’ cheese, for example, pork belly, and pink ling (just ask series sponsor Coles, which stocks the contestants’ pantry and gets instant market insights into what floats Australians’ gustatory boat). Zonfrillo, the restaurateur who has put native ingredients in the spotlight at his three-hatted Adelaide restaurant Orana, signed up with the intention to insinuate them into the everyday food conversation. This year we’ll see the Indigenous plants, proteins and spices he’s spent his career championing included as a matter of course in the contestants’ pantry. “It was my non-negotiable term,” says the Scottish-born chef. “The important thing was to make sure it wasn’t the standalone Indigenous episode, where it’s isolated out like some kind of leprosy. It had to be integrated into everyday MasterChef much like a carrot or an onion. I wanted it to be natural rather than a tokenistic ‘look at this’ teaching moment. It’s time it went to the next level and got into people’s homes.” Here come the judges: Jock Zonfrillo, Andy Allen, guest Gordon Ramsay and Melissa Leong in the new-look MasterChef.Credit:Network Ten Ingredients such as mountain pepper (“a basic spice people can use an alternative to black pepper”); lemon myrtle (“fantastic when you put a few leaves into a chicken roast”); and Geraldton wax (“It should be on the supermarket shelves, for Christ’s sake; it’s great in a stir-fry or braise”) are part of the MasterChef 2.0 mise-en-place. “It’s been emotional, coming into it not knowing if they’d reach for the ingredients,” says Zonfrillo, “but they did.” MasterChef 2.0 is also the perfect time to reflect on the capriciousness of fate. Andy Allen is the season-four winner who has become a restaurateur in his own right (he’s teamed up with the Sydney-based Three Blue Ducks stable). His appointment to the judges’ table marks him as one of the MasterChef graduates to have best capitalised on the media career prize fluttering from the confetti cannon. By way of comparison, his fellow season-four traveller Ben Milburn, with whom he filmed the SBS series Andy and Ben Eat Australia, is on the other side of the bench as a contestant. “A lot of eyes were on the choice of new judges,” says Allen. “I do feel humbled they picked me.” He’s been heartened by 2020s renewed focus on comfort cooking returning the franchise to its more accessible roots. “Last year I saw some things I never thought I’d see on TV, much less on MasterChef. There was an episode when they were in Japan and someone was cooking shabu shabu and I just thought, no one’s going to relate to that. This year it’s going back to real people serving real food with a lot of flavour. We’re not looking at pretty stuff for the sake of it.” This year’s viewers will not need to be eagle-eyed to notice the effects of the uninvited guest at the months-long dinner party. The arrival of COVID-19 forced a reset part-way through filming, cancelling the appearance of some international guest judges and modifying the typical challenge format. The cooking benches will be moved further apart, while for the judges there will be no more Gary, Matt and George-style eating off the same plate like a bunch of share-house mates. “Social distancing is very strange but we’re doing what we need to do,” says Leong. “It was funny to walk onto set and realise we can’t stand as close to each other and we can’t eat from the same plate. It’s impossible to ignore all the handwashing. But they can still make the show look and feel good.” As for anyone concerned that the nation’s talent pool of TV-ready amateur chefs has been swallowed up by endless MasterChef-inspired cooking competitions – well, you can take some coronavirus-inspired heart. “Who knows what people are doing with all this extra time at home?” says Leong. “They have YouTube, produce and a whole lot of time, so it bodes well for next year.” WHAT: MasterChef (new season) WHEN: Ten, from Monday, April 13 Larissa is a writer and reviewer Copyright © 2020", Larissa Dubecki ,"April 8, 2020"

84,/culture/movies/virtual-cinema-streams-on-theme-for-cloistered-film-buffs-20200408-p54i7k.html,Virtual cinema streams on theme for cloistered film buffs,"“Who would have thought that being closed already would be a positive?” says Katrina Sedgwick, director of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image. In May 2019, ACMI shut down its Federation Square site for a major renovation, while continuing to present film screenings in other Melbourne venues such as the historic art deco Capitol theatre. Andrei Tarkovsky's transcendent science-fiction epic Solaris is playing in ACMI's virtual cinemateque. In the COVID-19 era, all such events are off the table, but “we’ve been in a good position to pivot”, Sedgwick says. ACMI’s screen education programs, aimed at both primary and secondary students, have in recent times been delivered mainly online, and can be accessed via the ACMI website by teachers, parents and other members of the public. Also continuing online are ACMI’s screen industry programs such as the Running Free series of skills workshops, with new videos uploaded every Wednesday and Friday to the ACMI YouTube channel. And what of the Melbourne Cinematheque, Australia’s largest film society, hosted by ACMI though run independently by volunteers? For many years, the Cinematheque has screened double features on Wednesday evenings, spanning the whole of cinema history and often showcasing rare imported 35-millimetre prints, as with the Marlene Dietrich season in progress in March when Melbourne's cinemas were shut down. For the city’s dedicated cinephiles, it’s a devastating loss. “There’s a big audience that comes together every Wednesday night,” says ACMI’s director of film programs Kristy Matheson, “and that’s a genuine community. And it’s a very ritualised community. So for that to stop very abruptly, it just doesn’t make any sense.” Andrei Tarkovsky's transcendent science-fiction epic Solaris was selected for this week's ACMI virtual cinemateque. In response, ACMI and the Cinematheque committee have joined forces to create what they are calling a “virtual” Cinematheque. Each Tuesday, they’re announcing a themed double bill of films which viewers in Australia can access via streaming, watch on Wednesday night (or in their own time) and discuss on social media using the hashtag #acmivirtualcteq. Accompanying critical writing has also been made available, again via the ACMI website. Without being too heavy-handed about it, the programmers have sought out films that resonate with current circumstances, kicking things off a fortnight ago with Offside and The White Balloon, both by the outspoken Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has effectively spent the past decade under house arrest. Next came two films from the fabled British team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, I Know Where I’m Going and A Matter of Life and Death, both made around the end of the Second World War, and both concerned with place and local community, as Cinematheque co-curator Adrian Danks points out. This week highlights the Soviet-era output of Russia’s fabled Mosfilm studio, pairing Andrei Tarkovsky’s science-fiction classic Solaris with the long-suppressed social realist drama The Story of Asya Klyachina, an early work by Tarkovsky’s sometime collaborator Andrei Konchalovsky, who would go on to an eclectic career including the Hollywood cop movie Tango and Cash. Admittedly, this virtual cinematheque is a far cry from watching films on the big screen in a public, communal space. “It is most definitely not a replacement for the Melbourne Cinematheque,” Danks says, “but an initiative that we hope will help people at this moment.” On the other hand, an advantage of online delivery is that participation, again, isn’t restricted to those in Melbourne. “If folks anywhere else in Australia want to join in the fun, they're warmly welcomed,” says Matheson. In the meantime, work continues on the renovations at ACMI’s Federation Square site, while Matheson and her team continue to plan the film programs to follow the reopening. Sedgwick notes that the arts and entertainment industries have been the “canary in the coalmine” where the COVID-19 shutdown is concerned. “We were the first that had to stop, in terms of our cinemas, our theatres, our music venues.” But equally, she says, the arts play a crucial role in holding the community together at a time like this, which, she emphasises, won’t last forever. “When we come out of our cocoons, ACMI is going to be this wonderful, new, free offer for the people of Victoria.” Jake Wilson is a film critic for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

86,/sport/nrl/project-apollo-splutters-as-nine-gets-out-the-whacking-stick-20200409-p54iof.html,Project Apollo splutters as Nine gets out the whacking stick,"Minutes after news broke on Wednesday night about the NRL's incredible bid to restart its competition on May 21, I received a call from someone on the Project Apollo team. “Did you know about this?” he asked. “Did you? You’re on the committee!” Replay   No. He didn’t know. Turns out most of the innovation committee, which was formed less than two weeks ago to carefully and thoroughly explore when the premiership can recommence, didn’t know anything about it, either. Yet here ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys was about an hour later, talking exclusively to Nine News, confirming that a May 21 or May 28 restart was imminent. The fact barely anyone on the very committee formed to investigate strategies to restart the competition knew about its own recommendations suggests they are merely puppets. It also suggests they were appointed with a return date and an outcome already determined. Problem was, nobody got around to telling long-time broadcast partner Channel Nine, which pays the NRL $125 million a year to show its matches, about any of this. Nine already had its nose firmly out of joint, angered that it hadn't been given a seat at the Project Apollo table. Sources at Nine — publisher of the Herald — say the media company has become increasingly angered about the way negotiations have played out since the NRL decided to suspend the competition on March 23 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has become increasingly hands-on with those discussions — and he hasn’t liked what he’s seen in the past two weeks. When confidential details from one meeting with NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg and chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo were leaked to the press, it only added to the animosity. Channel Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has taken control of broadcast negotiations with the NRL.Credit:Peter Braig When the Herald broke the story on Wednesday night about the planned May 21 kick-off, it blindsided Nine. It was the final straw. So, at 11am on Thursday, Nine got out the whacking stick — and it whacked hard. A statement released to Nine News and the Herald said the coronavirus pandemic “has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years” and revealed it had “bailed” out the game with a $50m loan in the past, but that “much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. Around the same time, the innovation committee was meeting at League Central, discussing the game’s fabulous early return to the field … Then everyone’s phones start lighting up with messages and phone calls. Nine’s stunning broadside can be interpreted several ways. The immediate thought was that the company wants out of its broadcast deal, a line that’s been pushed by News Corp for weeks and, in some respects, understandably so after Nine announced to the Australian Stock Exchange it would save $130m if the NRL didn’t play another match this year. Indeed, News Corp has done a solid job pushing a particular narrative throughout this crisis, highlighting that Nine didn’t make its quarterly broadcast payment on April 1 … while often neglecting to mention that Fox Sports also didn’t make its payment. The play is understandable: Fox Sports and Kayo rely on subscriptions — and therefore content in the form of matches — to survive. Nine considers the game a “loss leader” — something that is great for its brand and news division despite the heavy costs involved with broadcasting matches. Many inside Nine’s Willoughby bunker are adamant the long-time broadcaster of rugby league doesn’t want to walk away from the game. Relax, they say, we haven’t heard commentator Ray Warren screaming “Papenhuyzen!” or “Sivo!” or any other player's name for the last time. Sunday matches leading into the 6pm news bulletin, the State of Origin monolith and the finals series mean too much to Nine. Rather, the attack on the NRL was seen as purely strategic as Marks plays hardball in renegotiating the broadcast deal. He argues the game is an inferior product if it isn't played before crowds and the season extends into October, November and December. In doing so, though, the statement is an extraordinary smackdown of the NRL’s culture, and in particular Greenberg, who was claiming only days ago talks with Nine had been quite “positive” and “productive”. Meanwhile, V’landys has been rather effusive in his praise of Marks in recent days, telling the Herald earlier this week: “Hugh is a good man. He’s a very good CEO. He’s looking after Channel Nine’s interests …” Marks was approached for comment for this piece but declined. Playing hardball is one thing, but some have seen the play as opportunistic. Nine might broadcast the game, it might pay the NRL handsomely, but it doesn’t own the game. And who is Nine to tell the NRL how to waste its money anyway? Is Project Apollo going to look more like Apollo 11 (which reached the Moon) or Apollo 13 (which didn’t and became a Tom Hanks movie)? After a meeting-a-thon on Thursday, club bosses were left feeling that June 4 was a more realistic start date than May 28, which the NRL announced it is now aiming for. “It was a waste of time,” huffed one chief executive. “We’d read it all in the paper already.” What’s clear is that the idea of players locking down in a “bubble” has been burst. The only thing that really matters now is working out how the NRL can get around border issues with Queensland and New Zealand. You can bet a whole lot of Kiwis on either side of the Tasman will be watching with interest to see if the Warriors get preferential treatment in coming into the country. Raelene Castle was close to announcing a rich new broadcast deal with Optus before coronavirus changed everything.Credit:Getty And you thought they only played the Blame Game in rugby league! Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle is under heavy fire as the embattled code struggles through uncertain times — and, in many respects, she deserves it. It explains the deep level of frustration and pain felt by the many people who still love and care for the game. That said, Castle’s crucifixion for not agreeing to a deal with long-time broadcaster Fox Sports pre-coronavirus is unfair. Sources familiar with negotiations report she was only a week away from stitching up a lucrative deal with Optus, one that was far better than the offer on the table from Fox Sports, which had been bullying her for weeks into agreeing to terms. That’s right: a week. Then the coronavirus went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like infecting nearly 1.5m people across the world. The Rugby Union Players Association might also be at war with Castle but a couple of staffers on the lowest of wages at RA tell this column she exhausted every option in trying to save their jobs. Interim chairman Paul McLean has declared that Castle has “the full support of the board” — never a great sign — but it is unlikely she will be frogmarched anytime soon.

Sources at Nine — publisher of the Herald — say the media company has become increasingly angered about the way negotiations have played out since the NRL decided to suspend the competition on March 23 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has become increasingly hands-on with those discussions — and he hasn’t liked what he’s seen in the past two weeks. When confidential details from one meeting with NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg and chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo were leaked to the press, it only added to the animosity. Channel Nine chief executive Hugh Marks has taken control of broadcast negotiations with the NRL.Credit:Peter Braig When the Herald broke the story on Wednesday night about the planned May 21 kick-off, it blindsided Nine. It was the final straw. So, at 11am on Thursday, Nine got out the whacking stick — and it whacked hard. A statement released to Nine News and the Herald said the coronavirus pandemic “has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years” and revealed it had “bailed” out the game with a $50m loan in the past, but that “much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. Around the same time, the innovation committee was meeting at League Central, discussing the game’s fabulous early return to the field … Then everyone’s phones start lighting up with messages and phone calls. Nine’s stunning broadside can be interpreted several ways. The immediate thought was that the company wants out of its broadcast deal, a line that’s been pushed by News Corp for weeks and, in some respects, understandably so after Nine announced to the Australian Stock Exchange it would save $130m if the NRL didn’t play another match this year. Indeed, News Corp has done a solid job pushing a particular narrative throughout this crisis, highlighting that Nine didn’t make its quarterly broadcast payment on April 1 … while often neglecting to mention that Fox Sports also didn’t make its payment. The play is understandable: Fox Sports and Kayo rely on subscriptions — and therefore content in the form of matches — to survive. Nine considers the game a “loss leader” — something that is great for its brand and news division despite the heavy costs involved with broadcasting matches. Many inside Nine’s Willoughby bunker are adamant the long-time broadcaster of rugby league doesn’t want to walk away from the game. Relax, they say, we haven’t heard commentator Ray Warren screaming “Papenhuyzen!” or “Sivo!” or any other player's name for the last time. Sunday matches leading into the 6pm news bulletin, the State of Origin monolith and the finals series mean too much to Nine. Rather, the attack on the NRL was seen as purely strategic as Marks plays hardball in renegotiating the broadcast deal. He argues the game is an inferior product if it isn't played before crowds and the season extends into October, November and December. In doing so, though, the statement is an extraordinary smackdown of the NRL’s culture, and in particular Greenberg, who was claiming only days ago talks with Nine had been quite “positive” and “productive”. Meanwhile, V’landys has been rather effusive in his praise of Marks in recent days, telling the Herald earlier this week: “Hugh is a good man. He’s a very good CEO. He’s looking after Channel Nine’s interests …” Marks was approached for comment for this piece but declined. Playing hardball is one thing, but some have seen the play as opportunistic. Nine might broadcast the game, it might pay the NRL handsomely, but it doesn’t own the game. And who is Nine to tell the NRL how to waste its money anyway? Is Project Apollo going to look more like Apollo 11 (which reached the Moon) or Apollo 13 (which didn’t and became a Tom Hanks movie)? After a meeting-a-thon on Thursday, club bosses were left feeling that June 4 was a more realistic start date than May 28, which the NRL announced it is now aiming for. “It was a waste of time,” huffed one chief executive. “We’d read it all in the paper already.” What’s clear is that the idea of players locking down in a “bubble” has been burst. The only thing that really matters now is working out how the NRL can get around border issues with Queensland and New Zealand. You can bet a whole lot of Kiwis on either side of the Tasman will be watching with interest to see if the Warriors get preferential treatment in coming into the country. Raelene Castle was close to announcing a rich new broadcast deal with Optus before coronavirus changed everything.Credit:Getty And you thought they only played the Blame Game in rugby league! Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle is under heavy fire as the embattled code struggles through uncertain times — and, in many respects, she deserves it. It explains the deep level of frustration and pain felt by the many people who still love and care for the game. That said, Castle’s crucifixion for not agreeing to a deal with long-time broadcaster Fox Sports pre-coronavirus is unfair. Sources familiar with negotiations report she was only a week away from stitching up a lucrative deal with Optus, one that was far better than the offer on the table from Fox Sports, which had been bullying her for weeks into agreeing to terms. That’s right: a week. Then the coronavirus went and spoiled it all by doing something stupid like infecting nearly 1.5m people across the world. The Rugby Union Players Association might also be at war with Castle but a couple of staffers on the lowest of wages at RA tell this column she exhausted every option in trying to save their jobs. Interim chairman Paul McLean has declared that Castle has “the full support of the board” — never a great sign — but it is unlikely she will be frogmarched anytime soon.

Dramatic days in rugby league are par for the course but even by the code's lofty standards, Thursday was notable, with the scathing critique of the governing body making waves around the game. Replay   The broadside from Nine, which owns The Sydney Morning Herald, was received by league officials as an explosive negotiating tactic and seen as heaping more pressure on NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg, who is out of contract at the end of October and fighting to save his job. Nine chief executive Hugh Marks was incensed about the broadcaster being left out of the code’s planning to resume the season amid the coronavirus crisis, having already told the NRL he believed the rights had less value with no crowds in the stadiums and if the competition stretched beyond October because of programming clashes. In a blistering statement, Nine said millions of dollars had been squandered over the years by “a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters”. “At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,” a spokeswoman said. “But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years. Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we’ve bailed them out many times including a $50m loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters.” In a conference call with clubs in the afternoon that preceded a meeting of the game's commissioners, V’landys told CEOs he was confident of reaching common ground with broadcasters, albeit after a period of negotiation. The NRL issued its own statement, saying “we are disappointed by Nine’s comments”. “We are continuing to work on a number of scenarios for the 2020 season in consultation with all of our stakeholders including our broadcast partners,” the statement continued. “Our obligation is to resume the competition as soon as possible, within public health guidelines. No decisions have been made.” ARL Commission chairman Peter V'landys.Credit:AAP V'landys told the Herald on Thursday night he would be speaking to Marks directly in an effort to reach a peace deal. “If Hugh walks away unhappy and I walk away unhappy that means we’ve done a good deal,"" V'landys said. “We value Channel Nine and Hugh Marks as our broadcast partner and I’ll do everything in my power to keep our broadcast partner happy.” Asked about Nine's criticism of the NRL's spending, V'landys replied: “The cost structure of the game is unsustainable, and that’s the whole game, and we need to rectify that. The coronavirus has brought forward a car crash we were going to have at some time.” V'landys said Greenberg's job was safe. “Nothing has changed in my eyes at the moment. Todd is focused on the job ahead,"" he said. Neither Nine nor Foxtel had a place on the so-called Project Apollo innovation committee, which has been headed by former NSW captain Wayne Pearce and on Thursday made recommendations about the competition re-starting on May 28 or June 4. Former Penrith general manager and premiership-winning coach Phil Gould, a commentator on Nine’s coverage, was asked to join the committee but Gould said on Thursday: “I was not invited as a representative of Nine. I declined for my own personal reasons.” The standoff fuelled speculation Nine, whose five-year $625 million contract with the NRL runs until 2022, could end its decades-long association with rugby league, and that a broadcaster like Network 10 could take on the free-to-air rights. A spokesman for the CBS-owned network declined to comment but Nine has indicated it wants to negotiate a revised deal and not walk away from the game. A central point of talks between the administration and broadcasters will be about the absence of crowds, which Nine argues makes the game an inferior product and is not what it signed up for. Sources close to discussions about what shape the competition will take when it resumes believe there is a good chance it will be played behind closed doors for the rest of the year, as would the State of Origin series. Nine and Foxtel have also told the NRL the extension of the season into the months usually occupied by other sports including cricket decreases the value of the rights, which ordinarily are worth $13m per round in total. While Nine argues its deal with the NRL has not been fulfiled and therefore a new one needs be agreed, the NRL believes it is on a solid legal footing because of the force majeure clause in its broadcast contracts. Such provisions are included in contracts to account for unforseen circumstances out of an organisation's control and tend to refer to events such as a war, government order or an epidemic.

""That's why maintaining those grants, to make sure we could light up as soon as we need to, is really important.

Nor will the network even agree to pay a pro-rata amount for games telecast, given it will be played in empty stadiums, devoid of the theatre of the crowd, possibly all through 2020. Furthermore, Nine boss Hugh Marks probably wants to renegotiate the final two years of the 2018-22 contract. In fact, he almost certainly seeks to extend the existing contract at significantly reduced rates. The days when networks bought sports rights to prevent the opposition acquiring them – as Manly bought North Sydney first-graders and relegated them to reserve grade – are over.

Fox Sports, which televises exclusively five games a week to Nine’s simulcasted three, has been sidelined, too.

NRL clubs are finding that ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce and ex-member for Dubbo Troy Grant, a former NSW Nationals leader, have formed a triumvirate, with V’landys dominating and everyone else subservient. Clubs are equally in the dark, unsure whether the competition, due to restart on May 28, will be located in Sydney or Queensland, or whether it will be two conferences or one. Now, with the Herald suggesting all remaining rounds will be played, it would seem V’landys, while not talking to the telecasters, is at least listening, or more accurately, reading Marks’s play. While Fox Sports hasn’t attacked the NRL with the unprecedented venom of Nine, it’s not as if the Murdoch empire hasn’t played a hard line with the other football codes in these belt-tightening times. It is a network that has previously demonstrated a duty of care to Australian sports – it paid a restructured FFA above market rates to unshackle it from a nationalistic, sectional club structure and it elevated rugby union from shamateurism, launching Super Rugby 25 years ago with a $US550m 10-year contract. But Fox Sports is bleeding red ink. It is dependent on $1.07 billion in shareholders' loans, has made 200 staff redundant and stood down another 140 on Tuesday. Those numbers could yet double as it seeks to further protect its bottom line. Now Fox Sports is refusing to make another rights offer to Rugby Australia and will seek to free itself from soccer, with both sports having already sacked most of their staff. So, where does that leave rugby league? It is a sport on the federal government’s anti-siphoning list, meaning it must be offered to a FTA broadcaster before Foxtel can bid. The financial meltdown, aka the Corona Correction, won’t result in NRL being screened on the ABC, because no commercial network can exist without NRL or AFL. Channel Ten had NRL in the 1990s, lost AFL rights 10 years ago and, as Global Sport and Media’s Colin Smith says, it has caused ""a downward spiral ever since and led to their insolvency”.

100,/sport/nrl/why-artificial-intelligence-could-be-secret-to-next-nrl-broadcast-deal-20200408-p54i9t.html,Why artificial intelligence could be secret to next NRL broadcast deal,"Artificial intelligence used by the Israeli Army is revolutionising sports broadcasting globally and could be the financial saviour of the NRL in the next broadcasting contract. As the COVID-19 pandemic closes down attendance at events, sports are looking to leading-edge artificial intelligence to add value to the broadcast of matches. Replay   With Tel Aviv becoming a second Silicon Valley, artificial intelligence algorithms developed for the Israeli Army can be used to predict a try in an NRL game. Israeli start-up company WSC Sports, whose founders are all ex-Israeli Army personnel, has developed technology in use in the broadcast of NBA games. However, it is not packaged separately to media buyers. Rugby league is a made-for-TV sport, but faces a problem with the X and Y generations drifting away from linear TV. The code’s challenge is to appeal to a generation that prefers to watch highlights on smartphones, rather than invest in a 100-minute telecast of a game on a big screen. Technology that uses advanced data science across multi camera angles and algorithms of historic try-scoring situations to effectively predict a try – packaged in 20-second or longer segments – would be additionally attractive to the short-attention-span generation. Could artificial intelligence have predicted James Tedesco's State of Origin series-winning try last year?Credit:AAP Colin Smith of Global Media and Sports believes the NRL’s digital arm, nrl.com, which has more than a million visitors, could link with WSC Sports to use their technology and sell near live highlights separately to interested broadcasters. Alternatively, nrl.com could be sold to one of the big digital giants, such as Netflix or Amazon, to stream vision on mobile phones. Smith, who admits to being a critic of former ARLC chairman John Grant when he invested $150 million over six years in nrl.com, agrees with incumbent chairman Peter V’landys that, currently, it is an asset with minimum value. However, he believes it can be reconfigured and build on its existing fan engagement, saying: ""What nrl.com must have is long-term, multi-year rights to NRL content that provide a growing stream of revenues for the ARLC or new owners. ""Most of the sports viewership of generations X and Y is via their smartphone and it’s unlikely when they are older with families, mortgages [and paying off COVID-19] they will ever return to sport on linear TV. ""Sports like the NRL must design live or near live content they will watch and critically pay for. One offering of nrl.com could be based on the technology that was invented by the Israelis to protect their citizens."" In the same way some veteran league watchers called the thrilling Cowboys try that drew the 2015 NRL grand final seconds ahead of it being scored, algorithms can be used to anticipate tries and fed into broadcasts of games. TV network bosses would probably say, ""I already pay my commentators to do that"", but no human eye can simultaneously do the work of multi angles and advanced data science with unique algorithms. The ""anatomy of a try"" can be projected onto the big screen at stadiums but is primarily aimed to supplement highlights packages provided to smartphones. ""The NRL, as a matter of urgency, should build the business case and financial model that defines the value of a reconfigured nrl.com that includes all of its current content and live/near live highlights,"" Smith says. ""I accept that current broadcast rights do not enable the NRL to offer this content in addition to what has already been contracted. But, with the ARLC probably looking at a long-term TV contract in the post-coronavirus world, nrl.com could become a significant asset to sell. ""Designed appropriately and quickly, it could address the NRL revenue challenges. ""The payment by the new owner of nrl.com would be an upfront acquisition fee plus an ongoing royalty fee to the NRL. The contract should be open to the current NRL broadcasters plus the four digital behemoths – Google, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook – plus the sports betting agencies and the OTT specialists such as Eleven, DAZN."" Grant, when speaking to the Herald following criticism on his legacy by outgoing Souths boss Shane Richardson, claimed nrl.com could always become a saleable asset. ""If monetisation was made a priority, nrl.com could be worth a great deal of money,"" he said. Given the parlous state of ARLC finances as a result of coronavirus shutdown, the incumbent broadcasters probably have the upper hand in negotiations. However, Smith believes nrl.com could be the code’s gold pass, achieving Grant’s ambition of it being ""a Netflix for rugby league fans"".

Could artificial intelligence have predicted James Tedesco's State of Origin series-winning try last year?Credit:AAP Colin Smith of Global Media and Sports believes the NRL’s digital arm, nrl.com, which has more than a million visitors, could link with WSC Sports to use their technology and sell near live highlights separately to interested broadcasters. Alternatively, nrl.com could be sold to one of the big digital giants, such as Netflix or Amazon, to stream vision on mobile phones. Smith, who admits to being a critic of former ARLC chairman John Grant when he invested $150 million over six years in nrl.com, agrees with incumbent chairman Peter V’landys that, currently, it is an asset with minimum value. However, he believes it can be reconfigured and build on its existing fan engagement, saying: ""What nrl.com must have is long-term, multi-year rights to NRL content that provide a growing stream of revenues for the ARLC or new owners. ""Most of the sports viewership of generations X and Y is via their smartphone and it’s unlikely when they are older with families, mortgages [and paying off COVID-19] they will ever return to sport on linear TV. ""Sports like the NRL must design live or near live content they will watch and critically pay for. One offering of nrl.com could be based on the technology that was invented by the Israelis to protect their citizens."" In the same way some veteran league watchers called the thrilling Cowboys try that drew the 2015 NRL grand final seconds ahead of it being scored, algorithms can be used to anticipate tries and fed into broadcasts of games. TV network bosses would probably say, ""I already pay my commentators to do that"", but no human eye can simultaneously do the work of multi angles and advanced data science with unique algorithms. The ""anatomy of a try"" can be projected onto the big screen at stadiums but is primarily aimed to supplement highlights packages provided to smartphones. ""The NRL, as a matter of urgency, should build the business case and financial model that defines the value of a reconfigured nrl.com that includes all of its current content and live/near live highlights,"" Smith says. ""I accept that current broadcast rights do not enable the NRL to offer this content in addition to what has already been contracted. But, with the ARLC probably looking at a long-term TV contract in the post-coronavirus world, nrl.com could become a significant asset to sell. ""Designed appropriately and quickly, it could address the NRL revenue challenges. ""The payment by the new owner of nrl.com would be an upfront acquisition fee plus an ongoing royalty fee to the NRL. The contract should be open to the current NRL broadcasters plus the four digital behemoths – Google, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook – plus the sports betting agencies and the OTT specialists such as Eleven, DAZN."" Grant, when speaking to the Herald following criticism on his legacy by outgoing Souths boss Shane Richardson, claimed nrl.com could always become a saleable asset. ""If monetisation was made a priority, nrl.com could be worth a great deal of money,"" he said. Given the parlous state of ARLC finances as a result of coronavirus shutdown, the incumbent broadcasters probably have the upper hand in negotiations. However, Smith believes nrl.com could be the code’s gold pass, achieving Grant’s ambition of it being ""a Netflix for rugby league fans"".

Brian Borruso said in court papers on Tuesday he tried to take a selfie as Woods approached his tee shot left of the 13th green in the third round at Innisbrook. Replay   But Joe LaCava ""intentionally shoved"" him, causing him to stumble and fall into the crowd. Josh Drechsel, the lawyer representing Borruso, said the lawsuit was filed two years after the tournament to get a better understanding of the injuries, described in the lawsuit as ""either permanent or continuing."" Mark Steinberg, the agent for Woods at Excel Sports Management, did not immediately reply to a text seeking comment. LaCava said he had no comment. Tiger Woods' caddie Joe LaCava has been accused of ""intentionally shoving"" a fan.Credit:AP Drechsel, meanwhile, issued a public plea for evidence from fans who might have been at the 13th green that day and witnessed the incident. One video Dreshsel has shows LaCava approaching the fans with his left arm extended saying: ""You've got to back it up."" Drechsel says he wants to find the fans who could be heard on another video. ""One says, 'I love Tiger, but I don't like him' and another voice is heard saying, 'He just pushed him. He just shoved him right out of there.'"" The lawsuit says Borruso went to the hospital to be treated for his injuries. Woods played the Valspar Championship for the first time in 2018, a key event in his return from back surgeries. Before record crowds, at times standing a dozen rows deep around tee boxes, he came within one putt on the 18th hole of forcing a play-off and finished one shot behind Paul Casey. Woods was named as a defendant because he employs LaCava, who previously was the long-time caddie for Fred Couples and began working for Woods in the autumn of 2011. Drechsel said he asked the PGA Tour for video from the tournament but said the tour told him it was unable to provide any without a court order. AP Copyright © 2020", Doug Ferguson ,"April 9, 2020"

Remarkably, even losing bets were offered cash-out figures and those customers were given bonus bets in way of an apology. The cash-out option on quaddies remains unavailable to customers as Tabcorp tests the software. Favourite Rubisaki wins the last leg of Saturday's quaddie at Randwick but by then some punters had cashed out for a windfall.Credit:AAP Tabcorp has worked through 1353 cases on the Victorian, ACT and NSW TABs and has paid punters the final quaddie dividend if they cashed out and were alive going into the fourth leg of the exotic bet, regardless of whether they had the winner in the final leg. “Those customers who weren’t alive in the quaddie at the time, but nonetheless received and accepted an incorrect cash-out offer, have received an apology message from us and a bonus bet,” TAB’s Adam Hamilton said. “The remaining group that were alive after the third leg will be given the greater of the correct cash-out amount or the full quaddie payment irrespective of whether they got the final leg or not. “This group was notified of that last night and that payment process has begun. These customers will also receive an apology bonus bet. “Almost all impacted customers have had their full account access restored.” One punter posted a picture on social media that they accepted an offer of $235,447.87 for just over 51 per cent of the Sydney quaddie, which ended up paying just $7506.80 for 100 per cent in NSW. The Cash Out option allows punters to take a dividend at any point for a quaddie, a bet where you have to select the winners of four selected races, usually for a smaller percentage of the dividend. The TAB froze the accounts of punters involved and the majority of those are now active again. It was fortunate for the TAB that the only betting on Saturday’s meeting was done through accounts with all agencies and PubTABs shut because of the coronavirus crisis. “[The] incorrect cash-out offers were generated as a result of a systems error. Where these were accepted, in some cases this led to incorrect credits being made to those customers' accounts,” Hamilton said. “We have been working through this issue to ensure we provide the correct reconciliation of balances. “The process has now been finalised. Communications went out to impacted customers last night and payments to those eligible have been initiated, while customers who weren’t eligible received an apology bonus bet.” Tabcorp managing director for wagering and media Adam Rytenskild apologised to customers involved in the quaddie drama. “I’m sorry for the frustration this technical fault has caused some of our customers,” Rytenskild said. “Rectifying the problem has been our top priority this week and our people have been working around the clock to fix it to ensure customers that are entitled to receive payment get those funds as soon as possible and that all impacted customers are looked after. “That process is nearing completion with payments and bonus bets being distributed.” Racing writer for The Sydney Morning Herald Copyright © 2020", Chris Roots ,"April 9, 2020"

Three months into his stay at a specialist spinal unit at the Pinderfields Hospital in Yorkshire, Masoe was told last week he would need to move home to continue his rehabilitation due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, doctors managed to persuade hospital officials to keep him on the ward so his improvements could be monitored more closely. “I’m just making the most of every day in here,” Masoe said in an interview with Sky Sports. “I’ve made so much progress in myself and I’m very grateful to be in here “In just one week I've learnt how to transfer from my chair into a bath chair, I’ve started to walk with crutches. “I’ve got my own walking frame, so I walk around my bed just with a frame.

As other football codes get on the front foot with plans to restart respective competitions, rugby’s predicament is far more complex given the amount of international travel and convoluted beast that is Super Rugby, which was paused seven rounds into the season. Replay   Rugby Australia’s general manager of professional services, Ben Whitaker, is a leading figure on a committee – a 'Think Tank"" if you will – that features Australian Super Rugby club chief executives, other RA officials and the Rugby Union Players Association. The group catch up via a phone hook-up twice a week and have been doing so for the last three weeks. They analyse a number of drafted models that fluctuate from kick-offs as early as May and as late as November, while also taking into account what the international season could entail. Ideas are then presented at weekly meetings with SANZAAR, which is keeping an eye on the fast-changing situations in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. First and foremost, Whitaker has stressed that player safety is paramount and that rugby is not sitting on its hands despite a perception that may be the case. The Sunwolves have had to remain in Japan due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Credit:Getty “I wouldn’t have thought we’re that different [to other codes],” Whitaker told the Herald. “It might be a bit different how we’re communicating it. “We’re ready to go once the restrictions for sport, but more importantly the community, are able to be lessened. Like all sports, we’ve got direct connections in through government to make sure we’re on top of the latest information. “We’re really well positioned to deliver Super Rugby and Test-match footy as soon as we can start playing. We’re updating our modelling that makes us as as agile as possible.” The immediate priority is getting rugby back on Australians shores, thus ensuring there is a broadcast revenue stream. A five-team competition, with the four Super Rugby sides plus the Western Force was scrapped late last month due to escalating restrictions. Whitaker has revealed the Sunwolves, an Australian conference rival who were set to be cut from Super Rugby at the end of this season, have flagged interest in being involved. Border restrictions would need to be relaxed – only Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members are able to enter the country – and the team subjected to a self-isolation period but it is certainly an option. Six teams would provide three games a weekend and more content. “The modelling is inclusive of them and they’re very keen to participate if and when they can,” Whitaker said. “We’ve engaged with the Western Force as well to be part of it. That’s how six teams would come together quite quickly. “If it was possible, you can see isolation periods coming into play. If that wasn’t an option … we’d move to another model.” A lot will depend on the international calendar, with travel restrictions potentially ruining plans for Test matches in 2020, which would be a disaster for not only RA but other unions around the globe. “Our No.1 goal is to deliver both levels of footy,” Whitaker said. “The inability to travel internationally is worst case scenario but we have the model for that. We’re very hopeful we don’t have to go down that path.” So what about the idea of a ‘bubble’, whereby teams can bunker down in one location to train and play away from the general public? It seems even the NRL has gone cold on the idea and while it is not warmly received by rugby’s decision-makers, Whitaker said it couldn’t be ruled out. For something like the Rugby Championship, it could be extremely beneficial. “Our advice is that would be very difficult to implement immediately,” Whitaker said. “It doesn’t mean it’s not an option in the future if it enables rugby to get up and running. The health and safety of our participants and community must be absolutely guaranteed.” A Bledisloe Cup fixture at Twickenham on October 31 was another left-field suggestion tossed out, as well as a three-match series against the Kiwis in Australia in December. Club rugby is expected to run concurrently with a domestic competition, while a supercharged four-week Australian Club Championship with 16 teams has been discussed, which could see Test players return if there is no international action. “If we’ve maximised the chance to play Super Rugby, then that could be an option,” Whitaker said. “I have to emphasise though we want to deliver our professional rugby comps first and foremost.” Tom Decent is a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald Copyright © 2020", Tom Decent ,"April 9, 2020"

Should she run her horse in the Doncaster or not? James Innes jnr returns after winning the Doncaster on Nettoyer.Credit:Getty ""I said, 'I'm not sure she can win the Doncaster, but you can definitely win [the Coolmore Legacy Stakes]. It's fillies and mares, a mile at Randwick which is perfect. She races really well fresh',"" Boss recalled. ""She decided to go to the Doncaster and I thought, 'please don't do that'."" But Roche did. And coming from last on the turn under group 1 rookie James Innes jnr, Nettoyer provided one of the biggest boilovers in Doncaster history. Boss had ridden lightly weighted three-year-old Brandenburg into third - and after the race didn't know how to react. He smiled, laughed and shook his head all at the same time. Behind the barriers at the trials I said Nettoyer could almost win the race. They laughed. ""That was never the plan [for Nettoyer to run in the Doncaster],"" he said. ""I rode her in the Ranvet [Stakes] and if you go back and have a look at the run and the sectionals, it was unbelievable. I said to Wendy, 'this thing is absolutely airborne'. ""Behind the barriers at the trials on Friday the boys were saying, 'if you can't win what can?' I said Nettoyer could almost win the race. They laughed. But I said, 'this horse can nearly win'. I didn't expect her to win like that [though]. ""I was always booked to ride her [in the Coolmore Legacy]. That's just the way it is."" So a week after celebrating his first major by heading straight to his parents' place to pick up some toilet paper, Innes jnr will make way for big race veteran Boss. Even after her Doncaster heroics, bookmakers still don't seem completely convinced. Nettoyer was a $9.50 second pick with BetEasy on Wednesday, a long way behind Chris Waller's three-year-old Funstar ($2.80). None of it seems to faze Boss though, the three-time Melbourne Cup winner who had an extraordinary spring carnival winning NSW's two richest races in The Everest (Yes Yes Yes) and Golden Eagle (Kolding). Yet you suspect he would get just as much as a kick out of the cantankerous Nettoyer chalking up a second group 1 win in the space of a week. ""In a race she's really good,"" Boss said. ""You've just got to cuddle her and talk nicely to her. You've almost got to dangle that piece of pizza in front of her. If you try to stand over her she'll just lie down. ""It's a really good story and when James won it we were all so happy for him. That prize money is life-changing for him, a young guy with a young family. It reminded me of when I was that age and it's life-changing, those sort of moments."" Boss will also ride Melbourne Cup winner Vow And Declare in a mouth-watering Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Danny O'Brien's regular rider for the horse, Craig Williams, is prevented from travelling interstate due to the strict biosecurity measures in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Boss will also link up with Etah James in the Sydney Cup and Godolphin's Colette as he chases a fourth victory in the Australian Oaks.

The Panthers could be back on the field much earlier than expected.Credit:Getty Following the meeting, a recommendation will be put to the commission and a decision on the structure and future of the game is likely to be announced. The Rugby League Players Association has organised a meeting with its players following the commission decision for final approval. The alternative proposal is a two-conference system, splitting the competition in half, although it seems likely that system will begin with both conferences playing out of Sydney. After high-level discussions between the NSW government and NRL powerbrokers, Sydney-based players will be allowed to remain at home when the competition resumes, which was well received by the RLPA, whose members were reluctant to undergo solitary confinement.

I can assure you that we want to work with the NRL. Government has a role here. I’ve had a conversation with the Premier that if the NRL can put forward it’s measures, it’s protocols, we will work with them to get through this season.” Border restrictions will see the North Queensland Cowboys, Brisbane Broncos, Gold Coast Titans, Melbourne Storm and New Zealand Warriors move to Sydney for at least two weeks, potentially at Olympic Park.

The Knights and Raiders are expected to stay in Newcastle and Canberra respectively and travel to Sydney on game day. The Warriors, who will be given exemptions to travel restrictions by the New Zealand and Australian governments, will likely have to isolate together for 14 days, but they will be able to train. The NRL is optimistic of the competition returning on May 21, although May 28 seems the more likely of the two dates. Broncos and Cowboys players could be asked to base themselves in Sydney under the proposal expected to be approved on Thursday.Credit:AAP Delicate negotiations between the governing body and its broadcast partners were held this week and will continue, with State of Origin now firming to be played in the traditional mid-season format. If the NRL succeeds in its plans for a May return, the grand final will be played in its traditional time slot, the first Sunday in October. Twenty-four hours ago, the NRL was preparing to isolate teams in a western Sydney bubble. The coaches' representative on the NRL innovation committee, Sydney Roosters mentor Trent Robinson, had a phone hook-up with some of his counterparts on Wednesday and informed them of the strict measures that were likely to be put in place in a bubble precinct. But those plans have been significantly affected by the state government’s most recent assessment of the crisis. The government has expressed its confidence in the NRL to respond to any changes in the health situation. A secondary outbreak could see the NRL return to the bubble model later in the year, although the advice it has received predicts the daily increase in COVID-19 cases will be less than 1 per cent by the time of the NRL's planned return in mid-May. The NRL is hopeful that by mid-June all states will relax their restrictions and it will be able to return to playing games at venues around the country, albeit without crowds in attendance. Teams could be free to return to training as early as the end of this month. Competition start: May 21 or May 28 Games played: 2 (competition points will stand). Games remaining: 13.

The eight-team national competition has been delayed until at least the end of June and chief executive Chris Symington says a range of scenarios are being explored dependent on when they can begin play. The coronavirus crisis has put the NSW Swifts' Super Netball title defence on hold.Credit:AAP ""We are still working to get an understanding of what's possible from a logistical point of view and also what's achievable for our teams and our broadcaster,"" Symington said. The competition was set to begin on May 2 and run over 14 rounds (or 18 weeks) including a split round and three weeks of finals. Symington said there was no ""drop-dead"" date for the competition to begin and felt netball had an advantage over competitions such as AFL and NRL because the lack of physical contact meant multiple games could be played within a shorter period. ""Given the nature of the sport there is the ability to potentially play mid-week, so you could condense and run a shorter version of the season – so the same amount of matches but over a shorter time frame,"" Symington said. ""That could halve our time frame to eight weeks because you could also look at packaging our three weeks of finals into one weekend or sudden death play-offs, so that's also on the table."" He said that a Netball World Cup tournament-style approach was also a possibility. ""That's something we could potentially do and capture as much content as we could in that time-frame without placing too much load on the athletes,"" Symington said. ""They would probably all go to a single location – where that is is anyone's guess at this stage. ""But you could take all teams to a single location as you would for a World Cup ... and you play a tournament style with multiple matches within a short period of time. ""That's a last resort based on timing toward the end of the year."" Symington recognised there could be some broadcasting challenges among a packed sporting schedule toward the end of the year with their free-to-air partner Nine Network also committed to the NRL. ""There's no doubt there's potential for a bottleneck to occur at the back half of the year when the shackles hopefully come off,"" he said.

Grant, the former NSW deputy premier, is also part of an innovative committee put together to help orchestrate the resumption of the NRL season. A 15-round regular season, two of which have already been completed, is widely tipped to be given the green light by the ARL Commission. That would result in a traditional mid-season State of Origin series and a finals campaign in September, which would culminate in a grand final in October. It could leave the door open for a possible international window, however a mooted Kangaroos tour to Europe would be unlikely to go ahead.

The Rosehill trainer has five horses lining up in the $2m feature, including Verry Elleegant, who lost to Queen Elizabeth rival Addeybb before she came out the following week and blew her opposition away. Waller knows Verry Elleegant can not try and eyeball tough Brit Addeybb halfway up the straight and must opt for a different game plan. He also has enormous respect for Japanese raider Danon Premium. ""We can't dare take on Addeybb head to head and beat him,'' Waller said. ""We need to tactically beat him somehow. But we have a good tactician aboard in Nash Rawiller, and he has a good draw to make it a bit easier for her. ""The Japanese horse is a very good horse and trained by a very good trainer, Mitsumasa Nakauchida, who has international experience.'' Crowds will be locked out for a fourth straight Saturday due to COVID-19 restrictions, which would have been more disastrous 12 months ago with the enormous interest in Winx's swansong. Waller is in pursuit of a group 1 for a third straight Saturday after Verry Elleegant won the Tancred Stakes and Nature Strip lit up Randwick in the TJ Smith Stakes. ""But I see racing at the moment as a job, something we must keep running day to day, and it's not about winning big group 1s,'' Waller said. ""Yes, they're a bonus, but our job is about making sure the staff are safe, we put on the show responsibly and we give people something to follow.'' Even without Winx.

""I spoke for about 20 minutes and cried the whole time,'' said Waller, who will on Saturday mark the one-year anniversary of the greatest horse possibly ever bowing out of racing at Randwick.  Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of Winx farewelling racing.Credit:Getty ""It took me about six months to [recover emotionally]. There was that mental drain. ""I'm not the best of speakers, and I'll often choke up at certain points, but I remember speaking at this charity function about a month afterwards and I couldn't get through it. That made me realise I wasn't yet over it. ""I still shed a tear with the key moments, but no longer every time I mention her name.'' Waller said he had never experienced pre-race pressure like he did last year when Winx started the overwhelming favourite with the 20,000-plus fans who packed Randwick and the millions more glued to their TV screens hoping to witness sporting history. For many of us, we reached the pinnacle of our careers on that day. The wonder mare did not disappoint as she made it 33 straight wins and a third straight Queen Elizabeth Stakes. ""For many of us, we reached the pinnacle of our careers on that day,'' Waller said. ""It's different to a sporting game when you might have 60 or 70 per cent of the crowd going for one team and 30 or 40 per cent of the crowd going for the other team. Everyone wanted to see Winx win. ""Two years ago Winx won her second Queen Elizabeth, we won the Sydney Cup [with Who Shot Thebarman] and Oaks [with Unforgotten].

While Japanese star Danon Premium and English Ranvet Stakes winner Addeybb dominate the top of betting followed by Te Akau Shark and Verry Elleegant, which have both won group 1 races this autumn, Vow And Declare is a $20 outsider. Vow And Declare wins the Melbourne Cup.Credit:Eddie Jim “I can't believe he's out the gate in betting. He's a really good horse, isn't he?” jockey Glen Boss said as he prepares to take the reins of the Melbourne Cup winner on Saturday. “He's just a really good horse. I can't believe he's nowhere to be spoken about. “He's the fresh horse on the scene. He's very effective at the trip. His first run was a ripper and he just showed he's back. “Regardless of all that, he's just a really good racehorse. You can't pick apart his form and say he got lucky winning the Melbourne Cup.” Traditionally, Australian Melbourne Cup winners are held in high regard when they return, but it appears as if Vow And Declare has been cast purely as a stayer. Trainer Danny O’Brien has targeted Vow And Declare at the Queen Elizabeth Stakes as part of the  preparation for his Melbourne Cup defence in November and indications are he has come back a better, stronger horse. The Declaration Of War four-year-old ran home into third in the Australian Cup behind Fifty Stars and subsequent All-Star Mile winner Regal Power at his first run since his win on the first Tuesday in November, and O’Brien just wants Saturday to be a strong test over the Randwick 2000m. We want it to be willing because he is a strong stayer, and I don’t think the soft ground will worry him. “He has had the Australian Cup run and a really strong gallop on race day the other day,” O'Brien  said. “He is going to present really well for the Queen Elizabeth. If the race was 2400m I would be very confident of [winning], but 2000m is just outside of his best trip. “But if it was to become a test of stamina, that would be a big advantage for him. We want it to be willing because he is a strong stayer, and I don’t think the soft ground will worry him. “Bossy has a ride on him for a win last year and has always had a big opinion of him.” Boss summed up his contenders but wouldn't want to be on any other horse on Saturday than Vow And Declare, who he won the Tatt’s Cup on in Brisbane last year. “You know what Chris's filly [Verry Elleegant] is doing, she's absolutely airborne at the moment,” Boss said. “I think a couple of our horses might have the measure of [Addeybb], but the Japanese are so good at travelling and [Danon Premium] has obviously got really good form. It could blow us all away, but who knows. “But don’t count my bloke out of it.” Vow And Declare will stay in work from now until the Melbourne Cup, but O’Brien is looking to re-program him with no Queensland carnival. “The plan was always Australian Cup, Queen Elizabeth and then Brisbane. Obviously the Queensland part of it is out now,” O’Brien said. “He could even end up running in the Andrew Ramsden [a Melbourne Cup qualifier at Flemington in May] which is weight-for-age, and we will look for other races. “We are going to do exactly what we did with him last year. He was first-up in April and his last run was in the Melbourne Cup and he just stayed in work. “We are just going to chip away.

His pair of Kiwis already have international form references from the spring and he believes they are going better now. Te Akau Shark and Melody Belle are ready for the international challenge of the Queen Elizabeth StakesCredit:AAP Te Akau Shark closed off into third behind Lys Gracieux in last year's Cox Plate, while Melody Belle was runner-up to Magic Wand in the Mackinnon Stakes. “We know where we stand in terms of international form and if they run up to their spring form, the Kiwis will be competitive,” Richards said. “We have have them in the right sort of shape to do that, if not a bit better than the spring. “I have a lot of respect for the internationals but we still have got to have a crack at them and we knew would have to beat them in this race.” Te Akau Shark has become a two-time group 1 winner this preparation but is still a $6 third pick in the betting behind Japanese star Danon Premium, the $3.60 favourite, and the Ranvet Stakes winner Addeybb at $4.60. After a hat-trick of wins to start his campaign, Te Akau Shark was found out when back in the field as the George Ryder Stakes become a sprint home, where he could only manage third behind Dreamforce. There has been a drama around Te Akau Shark having a bruised foot since after he stepped on stone at Randwick, but he hasn't missed any fast work and Richards believes a testing 2000m will suit him. “He was caught out by the slow speed last time and things didn’t go our way. He is a horse that settles and can accelerate off a good speed,"" Richards said. “We have spaced his [runs] because he enjoys that time to recover and he is very sharp going into Saturday. Melody Belle wins the Empire Rose Stakes at Flemington in the spring.  Credit:Getty Images “I think up to 2000m, it is important that he gets some cover and switches off. “I think if they go along at a genuine tempo he will quicken better than most of them at the end of 2000m. He is a lot stronger now [than the spring]."" Te Akau Shark's preparation has been designed to match last spring and it is the same with Melody Belle, who backs up after being fourth in Nettoyer's Doncaster last weekend. She had a similar back-up in the spring and ran out a strong 2000m. “I just thought with her if we went to the mile again [in the Coolmore Legacy] we would get caught wanting a little bit,” Richards said. ""This has always been her target race. What have tried to do is mirror what we did in the spring where she won the Empire Rose and backed up well in the Mackinnon Stakes at 2000m. “Opie has stuck with the Shark but Kerrin McEvoy is good replacement and I would expect her to run well.” Richards will watch on television from lockdown in New Zealand and is hopeful of another Australian group 1 double. He kicked the autumn off in style with Te Akau Shark and Probabeel in the Chipping Norton Stakes and Surround Stakes on February 29. Probabeel gets to her final destination in the Australian Oaks and Richards is hoping the track will get towards a good rating. “She is in good shape. We would rather sunshine than rain this week,” Richards said. ""I think she will sprint better on top of the ground. ""I don’t think the 2400m is a problem for her.
