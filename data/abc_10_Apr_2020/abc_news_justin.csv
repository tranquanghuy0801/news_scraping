Authorities including the Premier and the Police Commissioner have repeatedly urged people to cancel their long weekend travel plans and not to take unnecessary journeys, to protect the community from the spread of coronavirus. ""This Easter, this school holidays, travel around this state is completely and utterly off. We do not want people heading out,"" Premier Steven Marshall said on Sunday. However, Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns including Port Elliott and Victor Harbor, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, have noticed a rise in travellers.   She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had begun arriving in recent weeks, and the local population was still continuing to swell. ""We've got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we're very concerned,"" Ms Green said. ""Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing — the locals have been talking [about this] on social media."" Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town yesterday, despite the fact local accommodation was closed.   She said while some of them were ratepayers who owned holiday houses in the area, she urged anyone who did not need to be in the area to stay away. ""The shops are just packed and no-one's taking the social-distancing rules into consideration, and it's not fair to us,"" she said. ""It's a bit concerning because we've got such an elderly population here, it's one of the high risk areas. ""We want you to come but just not at the moment.""   Coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in South Australia and there have been 421 confirmed cases. ""At the locations people tend to holiday we'll be out in force. We'll have police horses, we'll be using the police helicopter, the police plane, and also drones to monitor areas where we believe crowds are likely to gather,"" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. ""We've also been in touch with most holiday camps and caravan parks. ""People are not welcome in those areas and some shops are refusing to serve people who do not reside in those areas."" Extra police will monitor border control points, ""limiting the opportunity for people to visit those well-known holiday areas"".   Police yesterday confirmed eleven people had been fined after a house party in Port Augusta on Tuesday night, after the group repeatedly ignored directives from officers. ""The crowd were forcibly dispersed,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""We are prepared to show some tolerance … but where this is a blatant disregard for those warnings, we will take action.""     The Commissioner also warned people who spit or deliberately cough to scare others on public transport could be committing an offence. It follows anecdotal reports of people intentionally coughing near drivers or other passengers to cause distress. ""Any action like that, that is done to cause fear of infection may well constitute a criminal offence,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""If those matters are reported and we're able to identify those people we will take action. This is an abhorrent act.""      ",,"April 10, 2020"

The week-long storm has destroyed homes, cut off power and killed dozens in four Pacific island countries. Local disaster teams in Vanuatu hope to reach some of the worst-affected areas today. Glen Craig from the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council estimates up to 90 per cent of homes in the country's second largest town, Luganville, have been damaged. ""It's worse than what we thought,"" he said. ""People here are positive. I think they're still a bit shell-shocked at the moment but they know that help is coming but help will need to come fast. ""Hopefully Australia and New Zealand military, especially, can start to mobilise — the airfield's fine for landing heavy aircraft.""   Aid groups predict Vanuatu's recovery could take more than 12 months. The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"", with fears the damage in some places has been worse than Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million — more than half of the country's annual GDP. Kendra Gates Derousseau, the country director at World Vision in Vanuatu, told the ABC damage she had seen in Luganville and video of Pentecost Island, ""indicate that the damage is significantly worse than tropical Cyclone Pam"". ""The body of Harold was smaller than Pam, so the damage is less expansive in terms of numbers of islands, but the islands that were hit — it almost looked like a tornado had ripped through Luganville,"" she said. ""Instead of things being wind-blown and toppled, they were literally torn to pieces.""    The ADF will deliver relief supplies such as blankets, lanterns, shelter and hygiene kits. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the assistance for Vanuatu was ""part of our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder during times of crisis."" Foreign Minister Marise Payne said there would likely be more assistance announced in the coming days. ""We are acutely conscious that this comes on top of the impact and difficulties created by COVID-19 for those countries and so our support is all the more important,"" Senator Payne said. New Zealand announced on Wednesday it would provide $480,000 to Vanuatu to help rebuild after the cyclone. According to Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, however, ""no foreign personnel are being brought to Vanuatu for response efforts at the present time"". ""This will be an internally run operation,"" it said. Any crew unloading supplies would wear protective gear and remain on the runway, authorities said.   The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, severely damaged tourist resorts in Tonga yesterday.   Local police reported three tourist resorts north of the capital, Nukualofa, had been virtually flattened. Damage caused by Harold in Fiji, meanwhile, was worse than anticipated, the Red Cross told the ABC. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said the country was ""hit hard"" but that he was ""still waiting for the full damage report"". Flooding caused by the cyclone continues to affect much of the country. A tornado flipped the roof off a local college, Mr Bainimarama said in a message posted to Twitter. ""We've been through many cyclones before, even stronger than Harold. We always bounce back."" At least 27 people were killed in the Solomon Islands during the storm after they were swept off a ferry. Australia has already provided support to the Solomon Islands and has offered assistance to Fiji and Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide further help to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" Senator Payne said. ""It will be some time before the full impact of this disaster is known.""   Pacific nations have implemented measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite having relatively few reported cases.   While Vanuatu has not confirmed any cases of COVID-19, there are concerns the relief effort could compromise the vulnerable nation.  ""Foreign-donated humanitarian supplies, which have initially come from our partners from Australia, New Zealand and France, are being handled to strict health protocols to negate any risk of COVID-19 coming to Vanuatu,"" a statement said. Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu had no intensive care beds and that if coronavirus hit, ""it would have the potential to devastate the population"".   Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Wednesday agreed to establish a Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19, which it said would allow for assistance to be expedited and distributed equitably among member countries. Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, said coronavirus ""poses a real and extreme danger to the health and security of the Pacific peoples"". ""Never before has the full forum membership simultaneously been in crisis.""   The European Union, meanwhile, announced 119 million euros ($205 million) to assist Pacific nations to strengthen their health, water and sanitation systems in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ''The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge of our time,"" EU ambassador for the Pacific, H.E. Sujiro Seam, said.   Fijian authorities have urged parents to keep their children indoors. ""Even though the cyclone has passed, the threat of floods is still present and we still need you to stay home because of COVID-19"", a statement said. Observers fear cyclone relief efforts will be further compounded by the economic consequences of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Ms Gates Derousseau said tourism was 40 per cent of Vanuatu's budget, and was ""unlikely to come back anytime soon"". Australian National University development economist Christopher Hoy told the ABC countries in the region such as Tonga and Samoa were already suffering from severe debt distress.",Pacific Beat      By Max Walden and Catherine Graue,"April 10, 2020"

Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the man died in a Newcastle hospital, bringing the total coronavirus death toll in NSW to 22. He said he recognised the totals were more than ""just numbers"". ""These are people whose families will be missing them today,"" he said. ""On behalf of all of the community of New South Wales, and on behalf of the Government and all involved, our sincerest sympathies are with your family.""   NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the 69-year-old man ""acquired the disease locally, probably during a recent trip interstate... to Queensland"".

6,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-restrictions-fines-disobey-the-law-your-rights/12140644,Coronavirus restrictions mean on-the-spot fines if you disobey the law. These are your rights,"The message to everyone during the coronavirus pandemic is to stay at home and only leave if you really need to for, say, food, health care or exercise. Police now have powers to issue on-the-spot fines to people for breaches of public health orders as part of the coronavirus restrictions. Hundreds of fines have already been issued in many states, for example: Victorian police also pulled over and fined a 17-year-old learner driver for ""non-essential travel"", but later withdrew the fine. This last case shows penalty notices can be overturned. So, what should you do if you have been issued with a notice by police, especially if you think you have been unfairly fined?   Penalty notice schemes allow police to swiftly impose a fixed fine and avoid prosecuting the matter in court. Police and politicians tend to describe their benefit as reducing red tape and cutting costs. But many Australians are unaware of their rights and options if they receive a penalty notice. The following information is not intended to replace independent legal advice. You should also check your state or territory's rules and procedures.   Check the notice for the payment due date.  If you are experiencing financial hardship and cannot pay the fine, contact the fines administration agency to see if you can request an extension or ask to pay by instalments.     The directions of some COVID-19 orders are vague and have been hastily drafted. Many Australians are struggling to keep up with what's allowed and what isn't. Police have also had insufficient time and training to understand the orders, including what constitutes a reasonable excuse. This can give rise to arbitrary — and perhaps incorrect — interpretations of the provisions. You can request an independent review of the police officer's decision to issue a penalty notice. The request should be directed to the relevant fines administration agency before the penalty due date.   If successful, your penalty notice may be withdrawn or you could receive a caution in place of the fine. Grounds for a review may include: Review processes often allow you to provide copies of evidence to support your claim, such as photos and documents. If you disagree with the findings of the independent reviewer you can elect to go to court. A court may find you guilty or not guilty. If convicted of the offence, you may be liable for a larger fine and imprisonment for up to six months. You should seek legal advice if you intend to go to court. The right to seek an independent review or go to court is rarely exercised. As the NSW Law Reform Commission observed in 2012: The penalty notice system does not have the transparency normally associated with justice systems in democratic societies … Most people simply pay the penalty. Only 1 per cent elect to go to court, so that the guilt or innocence of the recipient is rarely scrutinised. If you don't pay the fine by the due date, you will usually be given a reminder notice and may incur additional financial penalties. If you still do not pay the fine by the extended due date, you may receive fines enforcement sanctions, including driver licence or vehicle registration suspension or cancellation, or property seizure.   In the rush to quickly enforce social distancing and social isolation rules, the flaws of on-the-spot fines regimes have received little attention. They do not punish everyone equally. A wealthy person is much less likely to feel the weight of a $1,000 fine — and suffer the consequences of fines enforcement sanctions — than someone who is unemployed or has had their income drastically reduced.   There is also insufficient evidence of the deterrent effect of penalty notices, particularly on those who do not understand the law or what they did wrong, those who are too poor to pay the fine or, alternatively, those who are so wealthy that the fine has a negligible impact. An important aspect of the rule of law is that citizens are made aware of the law so they can moderate their behaviour to comply with it. The speed at which the COVID-19 orders have been introduced, their breadth and their arbitrary interpretation by individual police officers can result in people unwittingly breaching the law and being unfairly punished.

10,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"

The 52-year-old man was charged with serious assault of a public officer over the alleged incident at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital on Wednesday. He is due to appear in court on June 30. ""I was disgusted to hear that report and concerned for the wellbeing of that particular nurse, nobody should treat our health workers like that,"" Health Minister Steven Miles said. Queensland's total of known coronavirus cases now sits at 965 following the latest 13 infections.   Mr Miles said the rate was much lower than in late March, adding that in the past week, there were 93 new cases, down from the peak week, which recorded 380. He said most people who fell ill would only have a mild illness and just 5 per cent were forecast to end up in intensive care. ""Other countries have seen up to 7 per cent death rates,"" he said. ""If we can keep our death rate well below 1 per cent, that will be amongst the best in the world and that's what we're aiming for.""   Mr Miles said modelling suggested the state would need about 1,000 intensive care beds during a coronavirus peak, which was less than the current number available in the public and private health systems. ""We already have more capacity than we anticipate ever needing,"" he said. ""We've ordered extra ventilators, identified all the ones available in the state, we have anaesthetic machines that can be converted into ventilators, we have manufactures who are re-kitting to make ventilators."" There are 897 people in mandatory quarantine in Queensland, in hotels, and police have issued 289 infringement notices, up to $13,000, for breaching public health emergency orders. ""I know police had to replace the waterfilled barricades with concrete barricades,"" Mr Miles said of the border-control measures. ""Everyone should be aware the police are out there enforcing these rules, they're on the border, they're at the beaches, they're making sure everyone complies."" Mr Miles urged people not to seek out ""loopholes"" in the rules and to spend the Easter long weekend at home.

14,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"

China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"

Saudi officials said late on Wednesday the ceasefire would last for two weeks, adding the move was in response to UN calls to halt hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yemen has not reported any confirmed cases of COVID-19, but experts warn an outbreak could be catastrophic for the war-torn country whose healthcare system has been largely decimated by the conflict.   On Wednesday, Houthi rebels sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war, Reuters reported. But on Thursday, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti dismissed the Saudi offer as a ploy by the kingdom to boost its international standing, while a spokesman for the rebel forces accused the coalition of several attacks after the ceasefire began.   ""This announcement does not express a genuine intention to achieve peace,"" Mr Bukhaiti said. ""The Saudis are still employing their air, land and naval forces to tighten the siege on Yemen … this is an announcement only to restore [their positions], to close ranks.""   Saudi Deputy Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted on Thursday that the ceasefire ""will hopefully create a more effective climate to de-escalate tensions"" and enable the sides to work towards a political settlement.  He also said Saudi Arabia would contribute $US500 million ($790 million) to UN relief efforts in Yemen this year, and an additional $US25 million ($40 million) to combat the pandemic. ""It is up to the Houthis to put the health and safety of the Yemeni people above all else,"" the Prince wrote. The war in Yemen has killed more than 100,000 people and many civilians welcomed the ceasefire.   ""We are tired of the war,"" said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden. ""If the war hasn't already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease."" Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the truce could be extended to allow warring parties to discuss ""a comprehensive political solution in Yemen"". He said the coalition hoped for three-way peace talks in which the Houthis, the UN-backed government of Yemeni President Abed Rabo Mansour Hadi, and a military team from the coalition would sit down to negotiate a durable settlement. In a statement, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis to engage ""in good faith and without preconditions"" in the talks to agree on a nationwide truce mechanism.   UN and international aid agencies warned that an outbreak of the new coronavirus in Yemen could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on a population with degraded immunity and war-weakened health infrastructure. ""After five years of war, vulnerabilities are high and immunities are low across the population as a whole,"" UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said from Sanaa on Thursday. ""If the virus enters Yemen and spreads, the impact will be huge, possibly catastrophic.""   An International Rescue Committee [IRC] representative in Yemen said that more than half of Yemen's medical facilities were not functioning and that millions of Yemenis have no access to proper hygiene, water or sanitation. ""This [ceasefire] promises to be a much needed respite for the 24 million Yemenis in desperate need of humanitarian aid,"" said Tamuna Sabedze, IRC's Yemen country director.

18,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-easter-victorians-told-to-stay-home-this-weekend/12140378,"Coronavirus deaths rise to 13 in Victoria, as millions poured into family violence support services","Victoria's death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 13 after another person died overnight.   The number of confirmed cases in the state is now 1,241 after 13 more cases were confirmed overnight. There are now 158 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus, one more than yesterday. There are 43 people in hospital, seven more than yesterday, and 13 people are in intensive care. Another 120 people have recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 926. Police have issued another 98 fines in the past 24 hours to people flouting stage three restrictions, and carried out 754 checks on people who should be in self-isolation.   Elsewhere in the country, a 69-year-old man died from coronavirus complications overnight in New South Wales, bringing the national death toll to 53. The rise in the national death toll comes as 280 Australians have arrived in Melbourne after leaving a number of locations in Peru. They immediately boarded buses and were taken to hotels in the city for two weeks of self-isolation. More Australians stuck in Peru, Argentina and South Africa are expected to be brought home over the next week. The figures come as the Minister for Prevention of Family Violence Gabrielle Williams announced the State Government would invest $40.2 million in crisis accommodation and specialist services for people suffering or at risk of family violence.   The Government will put $20 million towards short-term accommodation for people who do not feel safe isolating or recovering from COVID-19 at home. Another $20.2 million will help family violence services meet the expected increase in demand during the health crisis. The package will include about $5 million for technology and protective equipment and targeted funding will be provided to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. The Government has also announced a plan to help Victorians experiencing homelessness who need to self-isolate. Housing Minister Richard Wynne has announced $8 million will be put towards using decommissioned aged-care homes at four Melbourne locations to house 200 people sleeping rough, and provide them with healthcare.   To be eligible for the program, people must either be waiting on test results, have a positive coronavirus diagnosis, be required to self-isolate but have nowhere to do so, or have been discharged from hospital and require accommodation to recover. ""People without secure accommodation are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they can't self-isolate or quarantine, this will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus,'' Mr Wynne said.   The housing will be operated by Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria with outreach staff providing 24-hour support. Mr Wynne also said public housing tenants' rent assessments would not be affected by any Federal Government financial stimulus payments over the coming months.   As the country gears up for a different kind of Easter, authorities around Australia are pleading with people to remain at home and not travel to regional or coastal areas this weekend. On Thursday, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville said police would be checking on travellers on roads and in tourist hotspots to make sure they were complying with coronavirus restrictions. State MP for South Barwon  Darren Cheeseman has called for Surf Coast Shire Council to close all beaches this weekend to deter people from travelling to the coast. ""They should be closed to all activity, including surfing, swimming, fishing, walking, and sunbathing,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Meanwhile, Victorian emergency departments have reported a 20 per cent drop in patients with injuries as the state's stage three lockdown continues. The Department of Health said there had been a reduction from an average of 5,000 patients per day to 4,100 per day. But while there had been an overall drop in the number of people presenting to emergency departments, some areas have seen an unexpected spike during the lockdown.   Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had received ""an influx of patients with severe burns"" from home cooking and barbecuing. ""If you are going to be cooking, please pay attention,"" she said. ""And if you're going to be barbecuing, please, please do not throw accelerants like methylated spirits or petrol onto the fire to try and get it going."" However, hospitals and medical professionals have expressed concern that emergency department numbers might be down because people were delaying vital treatment.   Stroke Foundation chief executive Sharon McGowan said some patients who were worried about being a burden on the health system or contracting COVID-19 at a hospital were not seeking help when they needed it. ""We've already heard from our clinicians on the ground of two cases where individuals with the early signs of stroke actually delayed calling triple zero,"" Ms McGowan said. Ambulance services across Victoria have also seen a 20 per cent drop in emergency calls prompting Ms McGowan to urge Australians not to play down medical emergencies during the pandemic. ""We must be looking after ourselves in Australia. Every stroke is a medical emergency, every stroke is a triple zero call.""    ",,"April 10, 2020"

How normal that seems, now everything is surreal, with the nation ""holidaying"" in this peculiar, unpleasant limbo. As we contemplate the grimness we should also remember it could be much worse.  It's early days but we've dodged the horror of Italy, France, Britain, and the US. So far in Australia, the virus is being contained, the ""curve"" of new cases flattened.   Nevertheless, this Easter millions of Australians see little but uncertainty ahead, as they worry about their health, their jobs or lack or them, their businesses. The economic fear inevitably remains dialled high despite a trimmed-down Parliament (only 50-plus House of Representatives MPs out of 151) on Wednesday passing the government's $130 billion wage subsidy package.   Earlier in the week, Scott Morrison had received a Newspoll bounce in his approval, just as Kevin Rudd did in the global financial crisis. Bad as the GFC was, it's clear this crisis will be much more fraught to exit. We are only just into the restrictions but already the debate is intensifying about how and when we get out of them — a result of the relatively good news and people's natural impatience. The question occupying cooped-up households, half-dead businesses, and anxious governments (and their health advisers) is: what now? The immediate answer is simple. We need to endure Easter in a virtual monastery.  When Health Minister Greg Hunt says ""this in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus"", it is likely only a minor exaggeration. The longer term answer to ""what now"" will involve practical and ethical judgements, and contested views.     The exit strategy is uppermost in Morrison's mind — he has always bracketed ""livelihoods"" (aka the economy) with ""lives"" in his language. We're not going to jump from where we are now to that ""other side"" he and others talk about.  We will walk on a long perilous journey requiring complex decisions about steps and timing, with the risk of serious mistakes, and the certainty of pain. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says: ""We are on a life raft. We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.""  The national cabinet has asked its health experts for navigational advice. But the issue always comes back to the health-economics balance. The much-anticipated modelling the government has released didn't provide much of a compass. It told us the obvious: if we'd let the epidemic rip — which we were never going to — the health system would have been overwhelmed. The present policy is one of ""suppressing"" the virus — isolating cases, tracking contacts. Morrison believes it would be too costly to aim to eliminate COVID-19 here — the New Zealand route.   So the future choice is between attempted continued containment until there is a vaccine — a big operation in testing and tracing — or pursuing some form of ""herd immunity"".  The latter would allow the virus to move through the community (while protecting the most vulnerable).   The herd immunity path (there'd be a nicer name) would be very controversial and take more lives than attempting to maintain the suppression approach. Asked on Thursday whether it was possible, when we do unwind the various restrictions, to simultaneously pursue a suppression policy, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said: ""It's entirely possible, and that would need to be the aim. … The suppression strategy needs to be sustainable in the medium term whilst we work out things like when a vaccine becomes available, whilst we bring new molecules online to be able to treat the virus."" What is important as discussion gets underway about lifting some restrictions is that we get transparency on the health advice. This is being promised, but it's no good having modelling long after decisions are made.   There has been more than a dash of ""we know best"" in how the Government has explained things so far.  ""We're acting on medical advice"", it has said, to justify this or that measure.  But the official health advice has sometimes appeared less than consistent, and been criticised by some experts. Morrison has canvassed easing restrictions on a patchwork basis, first in places where and when it seems safest to do so. Those places would in effect be trials for elsewhere. This is logical but won't be easy.  If combined with the continuation of the suppression policy, governments must be willing to reimpose controls if case numbers increase again. And strict health protocols should be in place for how businesses and organisations deal with fresh cases. A present challenge is to manage the pressures from stakeholders and the community for an easing timetable. Innes Willox, chief of the Australian Industry Group, wrote this week in The Australian: ""We need a path back to getting the economy going again. … Businesses owners and their backers will quickly change direction, make other arrangements or move on if they don't have some hope or sense that the current restrictions aren't limitless.""   After an initial period when anyone who criticised the Government was likely to be attacked for betraying ""Team Australia"", a degree of political normality is returning, at a muted level.  Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

Children, restless and ready to arrive, can taste two weeks of school holiday freedom. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" come the eager cries from the back seat. But the road we are on this Easter — as families, friends, as individuals and as a state — is a road to nowhere. Stuck at home, ordered to stay inside where possible, gathering outside only groups of two, it is an Easter like no other. And it is one in which the road to a post-pandemic normal seems to be vanishing in the distance.   The journey to where recovery begins, to where we can once again enjoy life's simple pleasures, even a Sunday lunch at a long family table, has only just begun. Almost a month into Australia's dramatic hard-line response to the coronavirus outbreak, people are wondering when that moment will come. And it is not only the children asking: ""Are we there yet?"" The answer from the state's leaders is sadly and simply: ""No"". We are not even close. If this is a marathon, the starting gun has only just been fired. WA Premier Mark McGowan this week again likened the coronavirus crisis to fighting a war. ""We've only just started our battle here in Western Australia,"" Mr McGowan said. ""The months ahead are going to be hard. They are going to be frustrating, tedious and at times even boring. ""It will test us all, but this is going to be one of the hardest things many of us will ever do.""   The State Government has moved quickly to implement what it acknowledges are extreme measures as it grapples with the crisis.   It closed WA's borders last Sunday night, effectively rendering the state an ""island within an island"". Now, only those with exemptions to that rule are allowed in. There is also no travel allowed between the state's vast regions. Those measures and countless others, some which have had devastating consequences for local business, industry and employment, have helped ""flatten the curve"". It is a nation–wide approach to slow the spread of the virus and ease the pressure on the health system, to ensure it is in the best position to care for those who do get sick. In WA, the rate of infection has remained relatively low. Six people have so far died. There are 495 diagnosed cases, although the number of new reported infections eased significantly last week. But it is important to keep in mind the criteria for those who can be tested has been quite restricted to date. That testing regime expanded on Thursday, so more results may start to reveal just how far the virus may have spread in the state.   The State Government has been encouraged by the low rates of infection, but its message was clear this week: The virus is still out there. There is no room for complacency. ""We need to keep on doing what we are doing,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Even though the numbers in WA are promising we all know just how serious this virus is. The harsh and sad reality is we will continue to lose West Australians to the virus. ""So we have no reason to get complacent now."" The State Government is pleased with the public's response to the changes, with a majority adopting and adapting quickly to the restrictions in place. But with businesses shuttered and livelihoods either lost or threatened, people across the community are wondering just how long life will be like this.   ""It's early days, these are early days and we're not going to see a quick fix for this,"" warned Health Minister Roger Cook. And Mr McGowan repeated his message that people should expect it to be the reality for six months. ""I am afraid that's the message,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Look forward to a hard, long six months.""   He said if a vaccine, or what he referred to as a ""holy grail"", was developed that timeframe would obviously change. But there is no guarantee of when, or even if, a vaccine will be available to protect the population from COVID-19 Mr McGowan knows his challenge going forward will be to keep the public's goodwill intact over the long term. ""I just hope that in a month or two … people understand that it has to continue on,"" he said. The State Government must continue to manage the delicate balance between lives and livelihoods over that time. It will need to make constant assessments about if and when restrictions can be eased over the coming months, while facing certain calls from business and industry to release the pressure. It is what one international expert explains as the three-way tug of war — ""combating disease, protecting economy and keeping society on an even keel"". Another infectious disease expert, Michael Osterholm, told the ABC's 7.30 this week a middle ground needed to be found where younger people, who were less at risk, could start to be incorporated back into everyday life. ""And then when we have evidence the virus is not circulating widely, we surely let other members of our society make the decisions for themselves,"" he said. ""And then as soon as we see that virus activity picking up immediately, we do the shelter in place again and try to squelch it.""   An expert closer to home — Executive Dean of UWA's Health and Medical Sciences Faculty Professor Jon Watson — said the forecast six-month time frame was realistic. But he believes some restrictions could be eased over the months to come. ""Gradually people will, if the curve continues to flatten, there will be requests from business and industry and tech and science and export industries, to start to relax the quite significant restrictions we have at the moment,"" Professor Watson said. But his prediction is that the 'island within an island' policy may be the last to go.   ""My sense is maybe WA will open internally for business before it opens to the other states, and then the third step will be opening internationally,"" Professor Watson said. The Premier himself is wary of making any predictions about when that might be a possibility. But he said restrictions would be reviewed monthly and amended where possible. So while it feels like we are sitting still — quite literally in our homes over the Easter break — we are moving closer the other side of this pandemic. And the Premier is urging patience and goodwill. Reminding every West Australian that it all comes down to saving lives. ""This Easter long weekend, will be very different,"" Mr McGowan said.

26,/news/2020-04-10/darwin-ranger-jailed-for-drug-importation/12137930,Darwin council ranger sentenced in NT Supreme Court for supply of dangerous drugs,"A former Darwin council ranger, who used her job to scope out vacant properties for drug deliveries, has been sentenced in the Northern Territory Supreme Court for the ""careful and methodical"" supply of dangerous drugs.    Kirsten Rose Strickland, 41, worked for the City of Darwin when she organised for more than 100 parcels of drugs ordered on the dark web to be delivered to empty Darwin properties and Australia Post offices. ""The addresses were not randomly chosen by you, rather, you operated in a careful and methodical fashion,"" Justice Peter Barr said in sentencing. ""You identified unoccupied dwellings which were advertised for rent or for sale, to which you could have drugs delivered.  ""You also acquainted yourself with Australia Post mail routes and the timing of postal deliveries."" Between June 2018 and January 2019, Strickland ordered 154 packages of drugs from 41 international vendors and had them delivered to 30 different Darwin properties, addressed to 74 different identities.    The Northern Territory Supreme Court heard police located detailed maps of Darwin city, postal timetables and drug paraphernalia during a search of Strickland's Darwin CBD apartment.  In November 2018, after investigations by a joint taskforce of NT Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police and others, officers followed Strickland as she collected parcels from empty letterboxes around Darwin while driving a council vehicle and wearing her ranger uniform.  An empty package, containing traces of MDMA, was recovered in a bin outside the Darwin Council offices.  ""At the time of your arrest on 16 November 2018, Australian Border Force and NT Police had identified and intercepted 32 consignments of drugs ordered by you addressed to non-existent recipients,"" Justice Barr said. A further seven packages were delivered after Strickland had been taken into custody.  The court heard Strickland had never used drugs until she ""became deeply depressed"" and began using ecstasy in January 2018 at the age of 40.  A mental health report indicated a link between Strickland's mental health issues and drug use, however, Justice Barr rejected any argument that it led to her supply of commercial quantities of drugs.    ""Your depressive illness does not explain your venture into drug importation and commercial supply in what was a well-organised and methodical operation, both logistically and in terms of meticulous record keeping,"" Justice Barr said.  The court heard there was a ""significant element of fraud and dishonesty"" as well as Strickland's drug supply crimes. Strickland profited about $100,000 from the sale of dangerous drugs over six months. ""You somehow convinced yourself at the time of offending that you were not a drug dealer and you were just ensuring high-quality drugs for yourself and your friends,"" said Justice Barr.  ""However, rationalisations and excuses for criminal conduct are common."" Strickland pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying dangerous drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and almost 50 times the commercial threshold of MDMA.  She was sentenced to six years in jail, with a four year and three-month non-parole period. The 41-year-old is no longer an employee of the City of Darwin.",By Melissa Mackay,"April 10, 2020"

Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.   ""Far from people staying at home, they were being drawn out,"" he said. ""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last? Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said. ""There's a sense that the pandemic has exposed all sorts of gaps in policy ""A whole series of things that people have been advocating for years but got nowhere, are they going to become possible after this?""

""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last? Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said. ""There's a sense that the pandemic has exposed all sorts of gaps in policy ""A whole series of things that people have been advocating for years but got nowhere, are they going to become possible after this?""

32,/news/2020-04-10/would-you-move-out-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-covid19/12129508,Coronavirus sees university students move out to give their homes to people in need,"More than 200 university students have moved out of their apartments in Brisbane so their building can be turned into crisis housing for people experiencing homelessness, so they are not exposed to coronavirus.   Savangi Mund, 23, is studying a Masters in Data Science and moved into the Atira Glen Road student accommodation at Toowong in July last year. Ms Mund is one of 280 students who have agreed to move out of their self-contained rooms and relocate to a nearby apartment block. ""I was more than happy to do so,"" she said. ""In times like this, I feel proud to be doing my own little part."" Ms Mund and many other students are in the middle of university exams and assessments but moved out within a week of being asked if they would give up their rooms to those in need. About 257 international students and 27 domestic students have agreed to vacate the building at Toowong and move elsewhere.     Student accommodation provider Scape Australia was approached by the Queensland Government to see if student apartments left vacant after international travel bans due to coronavirus could be put to better use. Scape Australia executive director Craig Carracher said they had up to 2,000 empty beds across their six student living apartments and had so far been able to free up 532 beds in the Toowong apartment building.   Mr Carracher said there was a mixed response from students when they were first asked. ""There were some frustrations, there was some misunderstandings about the intent as well, but on the whole we had 280 students in premises at the time and the vast majority have been very supportive and relocated within one week,"" he said.  ""You can imagine in these difficult times if someone knocked on your door and said, 'look we'd like to consider doing something good here and would you be prepared to relocate to a room in another building a couple of hundred metres away?'   ""If that doorknock came to your home, I think you'd be concerned as well during a pandemic when you've been told to stay home.""  All costs associated with moving have been covered with students choosing to either relocate to another student accommodation building, move into residential housing or move back home for the semester break.   Mr Carracher said the students were supporting the community during the public health emergency. ""These students are incredibly resilient and brave,"" he said. ""They're thousands of kilometres from their own home, from their own support network, and they've been incredibly supportive. ""I think that goes a long way to talk about the character of international students in Australia and their contribution to the communities they live in."" Queensland Minister for Housing and Public Works Mick de Brenni said the crisis accommodation would be used for people at risk or experiencing homelessness so they have a safe place to live and avoid the coronavirus. He said the new residents would have round-the-clock security and support, with meals and laundry service available. ""Supporting Queenslanders does not end with giving them a roof over their head, in fact that is just where it starts,"" Mr de Brenni said. ""In partnership with service providers, we'll invest in integrated care to ensure the stay has positive legacy outcomes for all the temporary residents. ""By housing vulnerable Queenslanders, we improve their health outcomes, and we also give the skills needed to transition to stable independent living.""   The State Government is working with Bric Housing, St Vincent de Paul, Mission Australia, and the Salvation Army to move about 300 people into the self-contained rooms. Mission Australia Queensland director Darren Young said there was concern in the sector about how to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the homeless community and said the apartments were a positive solution.  ""They are people who perhaps were not the best at managing their health, they're transitory, they're mixing with people in similar circumstances and that environment is ripe to transmit the infection,"" he said. ""The State Government approached us and two other providers to say, 'you're running three accommodation facilities in inner-city Brisbane, where the accommodation is shared, people are living in common areas'.   ""They looked to find a solution to move people to a safer environment, which is a single room with their own toilet, kitchenette facility, bathroom so they can isolate if needed and keep themselves safe while we transition through COVID-19."" Mr Young said the initial focus would be on moving residents already accessing housing services in Brisbane, with 30 people from Mission Australia's Roma House at Spring Hill among them. ""We're going to focus on them first to get them into a safer place, but there is room potentially to expand further and bring more capacity about who we can take in that is rough sleeping and give them a safe environment,"" he said.

36,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.

The Australian dollar jumped to a one-month high of 63.4 US cents this morning as the record Fed stimulus weakened the greenback. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the world's biggest oil producers have struck a deal to cut production by a record amount (10 million barrels per day), but that was not enough to prevent a further slump in oil prices.   The Australian share market is closed for the Easter long weekend, but might enjoy solid gains when it reopens next Tuesday. It may follow a strong lead from Wall Street's benchmark index (the S&P 500), which surged by 12 per cent this week — its biggest weekly gain since 1974. Overnight, the S&P index added 1.5 per cent to close at 2,790 points. The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index lifted by 286 points (or 1.2 per cent) to 23,719, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 8,154. European markets also jumped. London's FTSE and Germany's DAX were up by 2.8 and 2.2 per cent respectively. The spot price of gold also surged to a one-month high, around $US1,684 an ounce. Global markets were propped up by hope the number of new coronavirus cases was slowing down and the latest announcement from the US central bank on further stimulus being pumped into the system. The Fed said it would allocate a massive $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) to further shield the US economy from the economic damage from coronavirus.   It had already cut interest rates to almost zero and re-launched its quantitative easing program in March, pledging to buy an unlimited number of bonds. Under its latest stimulus measures, the Fed will offer four-year loans, through the banks, to struggling American businesses. This new ""Main Street"" facility will funnel up to $US600 billion in loans (of at least $US1 million) to companies that have up to 10,000 employees or less than $US2.5 billion in revenue. Firms receiving the loans ""must commit to make reasonable efforts to maintain payroll and retain workers"" and not use the funds to refinance existing debt. The central bank will also spend up to $US500 billion purchasing municipal bonds from local governments, which are on the front lines of the health crisis and are also facing a possible collapse in their tax revenue as unemployment spikes and businesses shut under tough social-distancing rules. Many of these programs are due to lapse in September, but Fed chair Jerome Powell said the Fed would spend whatever it takes to get the pandemic under control and get the economy back on track. ""We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,"" Mr Powell said. ""We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery."" It was enough to make investors ignore the bad news — that 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance claims last week, according to figures released by the US Labor Department. That brought the total to 16.8 million people who had lost their jobs in the past three weeks.   The record number of applications for unemployment benefits are the result of businesses such as restaurants, bars and other social venues being closed. ""In its first month alone, the coronavirus crisis is poised to exceed any comparison to the [2008] Great Recession,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, an online recruitment firm. ""The new normal for unemployment insurance claims will be the canary in the coal mine for how long effects of the crisis will linger for the millions of newly unemployed Americans."" The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed on Thursday to cut oil output by a record 10 million barrels per day (or 10 per cent of global supplies) for two months. All members will reduce their output by 23 per cent, with Saudi Arabia and Russia each cutting 2.5 million bpd and Iraq cutting over 1 million bpd. But the price of Brent crude tumbled by 2.5 per cent to $US32 a barrel. Its value has plummeted by half since the year began. Investors are worried these supply cuts still won't be enough to combat the unprecedented plunge in oil demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   OPEC+, which includes non-members like Russia, is also expecting the US and other producers to join in its effort to cut production (by 5 million bpd) and prop up prices to help deal with the deepest oil crisis in decades. Global fuel demand has plunged by around 30 million bpd (or 30pc of global supplies) as steps to fight the virus have grounded planes, cut vehicle usage and curbed economic activity. If an unprecedented 15 million bpd cut were to happen, it would not be enough to stop the world's storage facilities quickly filling up. And far from signalling any readiness to offer support, US President Donald Trump has threatened OPEC member Saudi Arabia, saying it could face sanctions and tariffs if it does not cut supply enough to help the struggling US oil industry. ""We are expecting other producers outside the OPEC+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow during G20,"" the head of Russia's wealth fund (and one of Moscow's top oil negotiators), Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the world's poorest countries would suffer the most if the COVID-19 fallout drove markets to their lowest levels since the 1930s. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" Ms Georgieva said, speaking ahead of next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. She said the IMF would release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that would show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak had turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn.    Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis.  Now the expectation is more than 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this year.    Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at high risk, she said.   ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Ms Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession.  As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries has totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the past two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Ms Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices.   Numbers released on Thursday by the US Government showed 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.  That amounts to about one in 10 American workers — the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since the world's largest economy began keeping records in 1948. And still more job cuts are expected.  The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent, a number not seen since the tail end of the Great Depression. Ms Georgieva said there was no question 2020 would be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF was forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said.  ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.""   She said she and World Bank president David Malpass would pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they could use for critical health needs. She also said the IMF was prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that needed help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board agreed to double the loan levels it would provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide about $US100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

46,/news/2020-04-10/flu-season-with-coronavirus-could-mean-extended-lockdown-covid19/12136870,A winter flu season means Australia's coronavirus lockdown could last for months,"Leading health experts believe the looming flu season means Australia's tough social-distancing laws will not be lifted for several months, despite the NSW Government considering easing of restrictions in May.   On Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said some restrictions on travel and personal contact would be reassessed every month. The number of COVID-19 infections has declined, but experts warned lifting the lockdown could spark an influenza outbreak. Last year in Australia, 812 people died from the flu. Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza said an influenza outbreak would further strain hospitals.   He warned schools, childcare centres and nursing homes were places influenza could spread quickly. ""If schools are fully opened again, we could see influenza spread back through schools and into the community,"" Professor Barr said. ""Similarly this could happen in aged care homes, which are currently in lockdown mode with reduced visits.""   Epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws, an advisor to WHO on the coronavirus crisis, said the threat of an influenza outbreak meant ""we are fighting a war on many fronts"". ""An influenza pandemic would not only put a surge of stress on GPs and hospitals, but it would cause a problem for rational testing of COVID-19,"" she said. Both viruses shared identical symptoms and would create a need for fairly healthy patients to be put through a battery of tests. She said the flood of tests would frustrate the real-time collection of coronavirus data and would delay any decision to end lockdowns. Levels of Influenza A — the most contagious and deadly type of flu — spiked in February and three serious outbreaks in aged care facilities took NSW Health authorities by surprise.   Any spread of Influenza A is tracked carefully by authorities and is the centre of global pandemics which kills millions of people every year. The Federal Government purchased a record 13.5 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines, at the coast of $80 million, to ensure free doses were widely available in 2020.   But Professor McLaws said it was not enough and that all 24.7 million Australians must be covered. ""You need 95 per cent of the population to get herd immunity,"" she said. ""We need to ramp up drive-in flu clinics to get the coverage we need."" The Australian Medical Association urged all Australian's to help prevent influenza spreading by scheduling a flu vaccination with their doctor. Kean Sing-Lim, president of AMA NSW, believed the winter flu preparations showed Australia was ""not out of harm's way"". He said evidence from the coronavirus outbreaks in Italy and China proved lockdowns needed to be enforced for several months to be effective. ""It's difficult to predict the severity of flu seasons ahead of time — we have to plan for the worst,"" he said.   A NSW Health spokesperson acknowledged the tough approach on coronavirus was ""effective prevention against influenza"" but would not speculate on future lockdown plans.  They said the Government was offering free flu vaccines to people over 65, young children, pregnant women, and Indigenous people through GPs. Dr Sing-Lim said physical-distancing laws in Australia were so far slowing the spread of infection. Yesterday, there were 2,733 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW with 39 news cases added to the tally — the lowest daily count in the state since March 16. ""Everyone is adapting [and] adaption is the key to survival,"" Dr Sing-Lim. ""One weekend of parties and fun could put us back months — we just have to keep being boring.""

The Australian Medical Association urged all Australian's to help prevent influenza spreading by scheduling a flu vaccination with their doctor. Kean Sing-Lim, president of AMA NSW, believed the winter flu preparations showed Australia was ""not out of harm's way"". He said evidence from the coronavirus outbreaks in Italy and China proved lockdowns needed to be enforced for several months to be effective. ""It's difficult to predict the severity of flu seasons ahead of time — we have to plan for the worst,"" he said.   A NSW Health spokesperson acknowledged the tough approach on coronavirus was ""effective prevention against influenza"" but would not speculate on future lockdown plans.  They said the Government was offering free flu vaccines to people over 65, young children, pregnant women, and Indigenous people through GPs. Dr Sing-Lim said physical-distancing laws in Australia were so far slowing the spread of infection. Yesterday, there were 2,733 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW with 39 news cases added to the tally — the lowest daily count in the state since March 16. ""Everyone is adapting [and] adaption is the key to survival,"" Dr Sing-Lim. ""One weekend of parties and fun could put us back months — we just have to keep being boring.""

50,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478,One coronavirus number will let us know if Australia's outbreak is getting worse,"The vast array of data on the coronavirus pandemic can feel overwhelming, as we all try to make sense of how fast COVID-19 is spreading around the world and the relentless daily count of new cases and deaths. Helpfully, there's one number that can tell us quickly and clearly whether the coronavirus outbreak is getting better or worse. It's called the growth factor. The main thing to understand is this — to be sure we're staying on top of the outbreak, we must keep this number below one. And here is how the growth factor for Australia's outbreak currently looks.   Put simply, the growth factor measures how fast the number of new cases is going up or down. And here's the key point: Calculating the daily growth factor is as simple as taking today's new reported cases and dividing it by yesterday's new cases. Because these numbers can be a little volatile, we're using a five-day moving average of new cases for our calculations.   Of course, the growth factor will change over time. Even though Australia's current growth factor is below one — meaning there were fewer new cases today than there were yesterday — that could change. But for now at least, things are headed in the right direction. Australia looks to be successfully flattening the curve but as public health officials keep reminding us, the fight against coronavirus is likely to be a long one. Even if the number of people sick with COVID-19 gets quite low, the virus could start spreading quickly again without ongoing vigilance. [Want to see how Australia's growth factor compares to the US, the UK and other countries around the world? Keep reading, or skip ahead.] A figure like this is only ever as good as the data being collected. So when reading the growth factor, there are two extra parameters to keep in mind: community transmission and testing. The number of coronavirus cases originating overseas is starting to decrease drastically at the moment, and there's a risk those falling numbers could hide something more worrying — a smaller but rising number of cases caused by spread by community transmission. Experts say the rate of that local spread may be a better indicator of just how well our physical distancing measures are working. It's been difficult to compile data on community transmission. So far, the data we do have only starts in April. It shows little difference in the growth factors for imported cases and local spread. However, there are about 89 cases still 'under investigation', meaning their origin remains unclear.   Another question mark around the data is testing. We will only find cases where we look for them and much of Australia's testing has been focused on people arriving from overseas and their close contacts. Even though Australia has tested a high proportion of the population by international standards, Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says our high testing rate and low positive rate are a ""red herring"".   ""If you're not testing the increasing number of people with symptoms in the community, then you only see what you test for. ""If we can look at that in more detail as we do the breakdown [of community transmission] within Australia I think that's going to be helpful, because I do think it ties to the lockdown. The lockdown is all about community acquisition, not about the boats that came in four weeks ago."" The unknown number of undetected cases currently in the community may prove crucial to keeping Australia's outbreak manageable. Several states have announced they're now expanding testing criteria to include a broader cross-section of the community. So it's important to remember that any rise in the growth factor could be, in part, a result of more widespread testing. ""As we expand our testing we expect it to go up but that doesn't necessarily mean community cases are going up, it means that testing is broadening to capture them,"" Professor Bennett said. Finally, it's worth remembering that even though the growth factor is a great litmus test for how well we're keeping Australia's outbreak in check, other numbers are important too. Now that we understand what growth factor means, it can also provide a useful insight into outbreaks around the world — and how different countries are faring in their efforts to bring coronavirus under control. The following charts focus on the countries with the largest overall coronavirus outbreaks around the world, as well as some of Australia's nearest neighbours.             As you compare those global figures, it’s even more important to factor testing regimes into your thinking. If one country is testing a lot and another is testing very little, it’s going to have a major impact on how their growth factors stack up.

51,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
52,/news/2020-04-10/australians-pool-cash-for-coronavirus-flights-out-of-india/12138010,"As coronavirus cases escalate in India, Australians pool their cash to arrange charter flights home","A group of expats and aviation experts have banded together to organise private charter flights to bring home hundreds of Australians stranded in India.   Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the Government for emergency flights.  ""I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,"" Mr Quinn told the ABC. ""People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.""   Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle.   ""But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,"" he said.  India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases.   ""People assume [Australians] hadn't heeded the calls from home,"" Mr Quinn said. ""The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn't."" As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts.  He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation.   Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" Mr Hempel said.   ""I know it's a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. ""I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out."" The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out.    ""[We're] elated, absolutely stoked,"" Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room.   ""We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare."" The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. ""We were nervous that it still wasn't real until we were literally in the car,"" Mr Munro said.   ""When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.""  Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through.  ""I think it should not have been their responsibility,"" he added.  Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx.   Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India's lockdown.   On April 9, Ms Payne said she had spoken with her Indian counterpart about organising a commercial flight to Australia. ""People think it's quite simple that you order charter flights,"" Mr Quinn said. ""But what people don't really understand [is] there's a lot of complex issues that Australia faced that other countries didn't."" The Australian Government has stopped short of ""endorsing"" the private charter flights, stating government officials and contractors have been instructed to not fly Lion Air until an investigation in a 2018 fatal crash is complete.   But Mr Hempel said he personally had no safety concerns about the airline. ""They're a large airline,"" Mr Hempel said. ""In this case, they've been extremely helpful and at the end of the day they're scrutinised by the [International Civil Aviation Organisation] and the same levels of organisation that Australian airliners are.""

53,/news/2020-04-10/the-rules-of-driving-during-coronavirus/12132208,Can I drive under coronavirus restrictions? How many passengers? Answering your Easter weekend driving questions,"As the Easter weekend approaches, there is a great temptation to hit the road, but authorities have warned drivers to think carefully before grabbing their keys. Conscious of keeping coronavirus under control, police across the country have redoubled their efforts to crack down on non-essential travel. So what is essential? Can you drive to see a partner or a relative? What about a quick trip to a holiday home or for a leisurely cruise around town? Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings. NSW drivers could spend six months in prison, or be forced to pay $11,000 plus $5,500 per day if they continue to break the rules.

55,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
