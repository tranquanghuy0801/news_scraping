In Australia, two more deaths have been confirmed, a new $5,000 fine for spitting on health workers has come into effect in New South Wales, and people have been warned to stay at home over Easter. This story is being updated regularly. You can also stay informed with the latest episode of the Coronacast podcast. One in 10 US workers lose their job in just three weeks   Yesterday, Australia recorded its lowest rise in infections in almost a month, with just 96 new cases. But leaders across the country are warning that progress could be reversed if people don't stay at home over Easter. Police are out in force, slapping fines on anyone found to be breaching the rules on physical distancing and non-essential travel. In Tasmania, the Premier warned there would be ""eyes in the sky"". That includes NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin, who has now been fined $1,000 for going to his beach house. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's rate of new infections was only dropping because people had been observing physical-distancing rules. ""It's important because we cannot undo the tremendous progress we have made together in recent times. So this Easter we are staying at home. Don't travel. Don't go away,"" he said. Two more deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed today, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales, taking the national toll to 53. A man who allegedly spat at a Brisbane nurse has been charged with serious assault of a public officer. Police said the incident happened at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's fever clinic on Wednesday. In New South Wales, police will be able to issue $5,000 on-the-spot fines from today for spitting or coughing on emergency service workers or employees going about their duties in a hospital or pharmacy. ""If you had said some time ago, when this crisis started, that people would go out and cough and spit on emergency service workers and people working in pharmacies and hospitals, I would have thought that was remote,"" NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said. ""But we already have seen this sort of activity."" The change under the Public Health Regulation 2012 was signed yesterday after an ""urgent"" request from NSW Health and representatives from unions for healthcare services and police.   The number of deaths in the state of New York has risen by 799, a record high for a third straight day. Meanwhile, New York City increased burial operations on Hart Island, an island where unknown and homeless people are buried, as it deals with dwindling morgue space. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said social distancing was working, and the latest death count reflected the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The number of patients newly admitted to hospital in the state dropped for a second day, to 200. Mr Cuomo said that was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"". New York has now recorded more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19, or nearly half of the total across the country. A University of Washington model often cited by US and state officials projects that COVID-19 will claim 60,415 American lives by August 4, with the peak coming on Easter Sunday. More than 450,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far.   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is now out of intensive care, where he was being treated for COVID-19. The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ""in good spirits"", but he remained in hospital and would continue to be closely monitored. The news came as Britain recorded a slightly lower daily death toll from the virus, with 881 people losing their lives. The day prior, the figure was 938. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Mr Johnson, said the UK had not reached the peak of its coronavirus crisis and it was too early too lift its lockdown. UK officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Mr Raab led a nationwide show of appreciation for health service workers, with people across Britain giving a round of applause — many from their front doors and windows — for the National Health Service as part of the #ClapForCarers campaign. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the UK has recorded 65,863 cases of coronavirus and 7,992 deaths.   The Federal Government says it won't be relaxing coronavirus social restrictions so the nation's sporting codes can start playing again unless medical advice says it is safe to do so. The NRL yesterday said it wanted to restart its competition at the end of May, but Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told Sky News he expected the NRL would have to change its plans again if social restrictions remain in force. ""I'm sure that the NRL would not want to breach plans, I think that they would not want to breach legal requirements,"" he said. ""I suspect that they are making assumptions on where Australia would be at that point in time, and that's fair enough for them. I mean, of course, they've got to plan."" The NRL, along with other major sporting codes such as the AFL, suspended its season as tough rules to stop the spread of coronavirus came into force.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned the country will not return to normal until a vaccine is developed, saying that could be ""a very long way off"". The warning came after Canada lost a record 1 million jobs in March and unemployment soared to 7.8 per cent — with Canadian Government data suggesting the real jobless rate was closer to 25 per cent. Local governments across Canada have ordered non-essential businesses shut to combat the spread. Health officials in the country say the death toll is set to soar from more than 500 currently, with the two most likely scenarios showing between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths by the end of the pandemic. ""While some of the numbers released today may seem stark, Canada's modelling demonstrates that the country still has an opportunity to control the epidemic,"" Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said. Canadian officials say if all goes well, the first wave of the outbreak could end by July or August, but that there would be subsequent smaller waves.   Tired of waiting for a rescue from Canberra, a group of Australian travellers and aviation specialists have come together to organise charter flights for a rescue mission out of India. India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb its rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases. About 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, decided to help. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" he said. The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar.   The United States has reached a grim milestone: roughly one in 10 workers has lost their job in the past three weeks. Another 6.6 million people sought unemployment benefits last week, taking the total number of applicants to 16.8 million since the pandemic hit. It's the largest and fastest string of job losses in records dating back to 1948, and economists in the United States expect job losses could hit 20 million in April. With more than 95 per cent of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, businesses have shut down across the country. Nevertheless, Wall Street closed out its best week in 45 years, with the S&P 500 surging by 12 per cent. The US Federal Reserve has launched its latest effort to support the economy through the crisis, announcing programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.63 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses. The death toll in France has risen by 1,341 to 12,210 people, the fourth highest tally in the world after Italy, the United States and Spain. That figure includes people who died in care homes over the last two days. More encouragingly, the number of people in intensive care has fallen — albeit slightly — for the first time since the outbreak began. In Italy and Spain, which together have about 33,000 deaths, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But Spain's Prime Minister warned that nationwide confinement would likely last until May. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has surpassed 1.5 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.   The International Monetary Fund says the pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth ""sharply negative"" in 2020, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021. Even though governments have already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $US8 trillion ($12.6 trillion), the IMF said it was likely that more would be needed. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" she said. Ms Georgieva said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF would expect a partial recovery in 2021, but she also warned the situation could actually get worse. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook. It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,"" she said. The IMF will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.   Australian churches will be live streaming — and, in some cases, televising — their Easter services so the faithful can still experience them despite the bans on physical attendance. A Good Friday service from St John's Cathedral in Brisbane will be broadcast on ABC TV at 4:00pm. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney will live stream an Easter Vigil Mass at 6:30pm on Saturday, while its Easter Sunday Mass at 10:30am will also be broadcast on Channel Seven. As well, synagogues that will be streaming Passover services include the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, ACT Jewish Centre in Canberra, and Temple David in Perth. Across the globe, Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly-empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside, while in England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video.   UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned the Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a rise in ""social unrest and violence"". He said the United Nations faced its ""gravest test"" since the organisation was founded 75 years ago. ""This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d'etre of the United Nations itself,"" he said. The Security Council, which had been silent so far on COVID-19, issued its first brief press statement after a closed meeting. It expressed ""support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected"".   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia is being evacuated based on medical advice, as the spread of coronavirus in the country continues to surge. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has assessed that the risk of coronavirus in Indonesia is now too high for diplomats regarded as most vulnerable. It's understood Ambassador Gary Quinlan is regarded as a high risk for acute illness if he were to catch the virus. He's being relocated back home temporarily but will continue as ambassador from Canberra.   Australia's consul in Bali has already returned for similar reasons. The ABC has also learnt that an Australian man has died in Jakarta with symptoms of COVID-19, although he was not tested for the disease. At least one other Australian is known to have been severely ill. There have been 280 confirmed deaths in Indonesia, with 3,293 cases. But a low rate of testing means the true number of deaths and cases is likely to be far higher. The number of cases in Indonesia is expected to peak around May.   Iran's Supreme Leader has called on Iranians to create the sense of Ramadan in their homes, since public gatherings are banned as the country tries to contain one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Schools and universities remain closed in the Islamic Republic and a ban on cultural, religious and sports gatherings has been imposed. Ramadan begins at sundown on April 23 and lasts for 30 days. ""Because of being deprived of public prayings, speeches and so on during Ramadan, we should create the same senses in our homes,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech. His remarks came as Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced that Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen by 117 to 4,110. There are now 66,220 coronavirus cases, he said, noting that 32,309 people have recovered.            ",,"April 10, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-10/saudi-led-ceasefire-in-yemen-amid-coronavirus-hopes-for-peace/12140410,Saudi-led ceasefire in Yemen begins after UN calls for stop in fighting amid coronavirus pandemic,"A ceasefire declared by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen has come into effect, potentially paving the way for peace talks to end the five-year-old war that has pushed millions to the brink of famine.   Saudi officials said late on Wednesday the ceasefire would last for two weeks, adding the move was in response to UN calls to halt hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yemen has not reported any confirmed cases of COVID-19, but experts warn an outbreak could be catastrophic for the war-torn country whose healthcare system has been largely decimated by the conflict.   On Wednesday, Houthi rebels sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war, Reuters reported. But on Thursday, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti dismissed the Saudi offer as a ploy by the kingdom to boost its international standing, while a spokesman for the rebel forces accused the coalition of several attacks after the ceasefire began.   ""This announcement does not express a genuine intention to achieve peace,"" Mr Bukhaiti said. ""The Saudis are still employing their air, land and naval forces to tighten the siege on Yemen … this is an announcement only to restore [their positions], to close ranks.""   Saudi Deputy Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted on Thursday that the ceasefire ""will hopefully create a more effective climate to de-escalate tensions"" and enable the sides to work towards a political settlement.  He also said Saudi Arabia would contribute $US500 million ($790 million) to UN relief efforts in Yemen this year, and an additional $US25 million ($40 million) to combat the pandemic. ""It is up to the Houthis to put the health and safety of the Yemeni people above all else,"" the Prince wrote. The war in Yemen has killed more than 100,000 people and many civilians welcomed the ceasefire.   ""We are tired of the war,"" said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden. ""If the war hasn't already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease."" Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the truce could be extended to allow warring parties to discuss ""a comprehensive political solution in Yemen"". He said the coalition hoped for three-way peace talks in which the Houthis, the UN-backed government of Yemeni President Abed Rabo Mansour Hadi, and a military team from the coalition would sit down to negotiate a durable settlement. In a statement, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis to engage ""in good faith and without preconditions"" in the talks to agree on a nationwide truce mechanism.   UN and international aid agencies warned that an outbreak of the new coronavirus in Yemen could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on a population with degraded immunity and war-weakened health infrastructure. ""After five years of war, vulnerabilities are high and immunities are low across the population as a whole,"" UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said from Sanaa on Thursday. ""If the virus enters Yemen and spreads, the impact will be huge, possibly catastrophic.""   An International Rescue Committee [IRC] representative in Yemen said that more than half of Yemen's medical facilities were not functioning and that millions of Yemenis have no access to proper hygiene, water or sanitation. ""This [ceasefire] promises to be a much needed respite for the 24 million Yemenis in desperate need of humanitarian aid,"" said Tamuna Sabedze, IRC's Yemen country director. The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in a stalemate for years.     ABC/wires",,"April 10, 2020"
2,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
3,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
4,/news/2020-04-10/adf-plane-to-deliver-relief-to-vanuatu-after-cyclone-harold/12140456,Australian aid to help Cyclone Harold relief efforts as COVID-19 frustrates response,"An Australian Defence Force (ADF) plane will head to Vanuatu within days to deliver relief supplies to the small Pacific nation after it was devastated by this week's Cyclone Harold.   The week-long storm has destroyed homes, cut off power and killed dozens in four Pacific island countries. Local disaster teams in Vanuatu hope to reach some of the worst-affected areas today. Glen Craig from the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council estimates up to 90 per cent of homes in the country's second largest town, Luganville, have been damaged. ""It's worse than what we thought,"" he said. ""People here are positive. I think they're still a bit shell-shocked at the moment but they know that help is coming but help will need to come fast. ""Hopefully Australia and New Zealand military, especially, can start to mobilise — the airfield's fine for landing heavy aircraft.""   Aid groups predict Vanuatu's recovery could take more than 12 months. The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"", with fears the damage in some places has been worse than Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million — more than half of the country's annual GDP. Kendra Gates Derousseau, the country director at World Vision in Vanuatu, told the ABC damage she had seen in Luganville and video of Pentecost Island, ""indicate that the damage is significantly worse than tropical Cyclone Pam"". ""The body of Harold was smaller than Pam, so the damage is less expansive in terms of numbers of islands, but the islands that were hit — it almost looked like a tornado had ripped through Luganville,"" she said. ""Instead of things being wind-blown and toppled, they were literally torn to pieces.""    The ADF will deliver relief supplies such as blankets, lanterns, shelter and hygiene kits. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the assistance for Vanuatu was ""part of our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder during times of crisis."" Foreign Minister Marise Payne said there would likely be more assistance announced in the coming days. ""We are acutely conscious that this comes on top of the impact and difficulties created by COVID-19 for those countries and so our support is all the more important,"" Senator Payne said. New Zealand announced on Wednesday it would provide $480,000 to Vanuatu to help rebuild after the cyclone. According to Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, however, ""no foreign personnel are being brought to Vanuatu for response efforts at the present time"". ""This will be an internally run operation,"" it said. Any crew unloading supplies would wear protective gear and remain on the runway, authorities said.   The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, severely damaged tourist resorts in Tonga yesterday.   Local police reported three tourist resorts north of the capital, Nukualofa, had been virtually flattened. Damage caused by Harold in Fiji, meanwhile, was worse than anticipated, the Red Cross told the ABC. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said the country was ""hit hard"" but that he was ""still waiting for the full damage report"". Flooding caused by the cyclone continues to affect much of the country. A tornado flipped the roof off a local college, Mr Bainimarama said in a message posted to Twitter. ""We've been through many cyclones before, even stronger than Harold. We always bounce back."" At least 27 people were killed in the Solomon Islands during the storm after they were swept off a ferry. Australia has already provided support to the Solomon Islands and has offered assistance to Fiji and Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide further help to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" Senator Payne said. ""It will be some time before the full impact of this disaster is known.""   Pacific nations have implemented measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite having relatively few reported cases.   While Vanuatu has not confirmed any cases of COVID-19, there are concerns the relief effort could compromise the vulnerable nation.  ""Foreign-donated humanitarian supplies, which have initially come from our partners from Australia, New Zealand and France, are being handled to strict health protocols to negate any risk of COVID-19 coming to Vanuatu,"" a statement said. Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu had no intensive care beds and that if coronavirus hit, ""it would have the potential to devastate the population"".   Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Wednesday agreed to establish a Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19, which it said would allow for assistance to be expedited and distributed equitably among member countries. Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, said coronavirus ""poses a real and extreme danger to the health and security of the Pacific peoples"". ""Never before has the full forum membership simultaneously been in crisis.""   The European Union, meanwhile, announced 119 million euros ($205 million) to assist Pacific nations to strengthen their health, water and sanitation systems in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ''The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge of our time,"" EU ambassador for the Pacific, H.E. Sujiro Seam, said.   Fijian authorities have urged parents to keep their children indoors. ""Even though the cyclone has passed, the threat of floods is still present and we still need you to stay home because of COVID-19"", a statement said. Observers fear cyclone relief efforts will be further compounded by the economic consequences of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Ms Gates Derousseau said tourism was 40 per cent of Vanuatu's budget, and was ""unlikely to come back anytime soon"".

5,/news/2020-04-10/who-set-to-launch-international-appeal-for-billions-of-dollars/12140124,World Health Organisation announces plan to appeal for more than $1.5 billion from international governments,"The World Health Organisation is preparing to launch an appeal for more than $US1 billion [$1.5 billion] to fund operations against the coronavirus pandemic.   Now 100 days since the WHO was alerted to the first case of COVID-19, and after more than $US800 million [$1.2 billion] having already been pledged or received, the organisation says it will release a revised strategy plan and new funding appeal. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus believes the pandemic is much more than a health crisis, requiring a whole-of government & society response. ""For the past 100 days, our unwavering commitment has been to serve all people of the world with equity, objectivity and neutrality. That will continue to be our sole focus in the days, weeks and months ahead,"" Dr Tedros said. The appeal and strategy plan will commence in coming days.   The UN agency needs more resources than ever as it leads the global response against the disease that has infected 1.5 million people and killed more than 89,000.   ""It will be well over $US1 billion, maybe several billion,"" an envoy told Reuters.   The new appeal follows an earlier three-month appeal for $US675 million [$1 billion] through April, mostly for agencies operating on the ground rather than the WHO itself. It also comes against a backdrop of controversy after US President Donald Trump criticised the organisation over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested his administration might re-evaluate US funding. Mr Trump accused WHO of being ""China-centric"" and criticised its alleged missteps.   US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later said Washington was re-evaluating US funding to the body.   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded to Mr Trump's threat to withhold funding, by saying the WHO is ""absolutely critical"" to the war against COVID-19. ""Now is the time for unity, for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences,"" Mr Guterres said.   The United States is the biggest overall donor, contributing more than $US400 million [$600 million] in 2019 to the UN agency, roughly 15 pe cent of its budget, in comparison, China's contribution was about $US44 million [$70 million]. China, however has contributed $US20 million [$31 million] to the WHO's coronavirus appeal so far, exceeding the $US14.6 million [$23 million] from the United States. Reuters    ",,"April 10, 2020"
6,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-poverty-study-research-oxfam-anu/12136222,"Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty by coronavirus economic fallout, study finds","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy could see as many as 580 million people — 8 per cent of the world's population — pushed into poverty, according to researchers.   Aid groups, meanwhile, are calling on rich countries to cancel foreign debt held by developing nations in light of projections that decades of poverty alleviation efforts could be lost. A paper released by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research projects that if consumption contracts in developing countries by 20 per cent, it could see an increase in poverty for 400 to 600 million people globally. ""We were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow COVID-19 in developing countries,"" said Professor Andy Sumner, one of the lead authors from King's College London.   ""Our findings point towards the importance of a dramatic expansion of social safety nets in developing countries as soon as possible and — more broadly — much greater attention to the impact of COVID in developing countries and what the international community can do to help.""   ""Even under our most conservative scenario, too conservative to be realistic … we're still talking about 100 million extra people [falling] into extreme poverty,"" said Christopher Hoy of the Australian National University, another author of the report.   In the Middle East and North Africa, he said, it was ""very possible"" that poverty rates could return to what they were in 1990. The research was released as scientists said they were concerned a new wave of coronavirus would spread across Asia. Humanitarian workers have warned that the pandemic could prove devastating in much of Asia and the Pacific, due to widespread poverty, crowded living conditions and weak healthcare systems. CARE Australia fears a ""nightmare scenario"" if the disease takes hold in Papua New Guinea and Australia's other Pacific neighbours.   In Indonesia — the world's fourth most populous nation — projections have shown up to 240,000 people could die  if no control measures were taken. Mr Hoy warned ""the economic crisis was potentially going to be even more severe than the health crisis"". ""In Indonesia, for example, extreme poverty is quite low but a lot of people are just above the extreme poverty line,"" he told the ABC.    ""In our moderate scenario we'd expect to see a 50 per cent increase in the people living in extreme poverty. Under our extreme scenario it would more than double."" Lyn Morgain, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said that while a number of countries in South-East Asia had technically reached middle income status, it obscured the fact that development was uneven and that there continued to be ""profound and deep poverty in many of those nation states"".   Successive Australian governments have cut aid to South-East Asia and South Asia, in favour of funding programs in the Pacific.  Ms Morgain said that there was ""greater utility"" in a broader regional approach focused on Asia as well as the Pacific nations, especially during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not something we would regard as simply a favour to others. Our region has great strength and capability,"" she said. The ABC asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Australia's assistance to the region, but had not received a response at the time of publication.  Last month, the United Nations unveiled a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan and urged members of the G20, including Australia, to contribute to helping developing countries weather the economic storm caused by coronavirus. ""The only way for Australia to have a safe and prosperous future, is if Australia is in a safe and prosperous region,"" Mr Hoy said. The World Bank has predicted a global recession and estimated recently that nearly 24 million fewer people would escape poverty across the Asia Pacific in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic.  It called for ""urgent investment"" in healthcare systems and fiscal measures such as subsidising sick leave.   ""Countries in East Asia and the Pacific that were already coping with international trade tensions and the repercussions of the spread of COVID-19 in China are now faced with a global shock,"" said Victoria Kwakwa, the World Bank's vice president for East Asia and the Pacific.  ""The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined."" Along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank recently called on creditors to allow poor countries to suspend debt payments during the crisis. But Ms Morgain said this did not go far enough, and called for debts to be cancelled altogether.   ""What is vitally important is that we take the big structural choices like forgiving debt to allow countries to make their own path to recovery,"" she told the ABC. ""On the global stage there is also an opportunity for Australia to take a leadership role, with an understanding that like people people, countries can't get back on their feet if they're struggling with unethical levels of debt."" Tonga and Samoa, for example, have high levels of debt distress, Mr Hoy said.  ""One thing that Australia could do is step up and assist with that debt cancellation,"" he said.  The World Bank and IMF will meet in Washington next week to discuss global economic priorities. Researchers hope that the stark poverty projections inform decisions during these forums. ""The work we have ahead of us is completely unimaginable,"" Ms Morgain said. ""We can step in now and make decisions at the global level … to make things for everyone so much better on the other side of this pandemic.""     ",By Max Walden,"April 10, 2020"
7,/news/2020-04-10/china-reclassifies-dogs-as-pets-not-livestock/12140312,China's dogs to be recognised as pets not livestock under coronavirus regulation review,"China has drawn up new guidelines to reclassify dogs as pets rather than livestock, the Agriculture Ministry said as part of its response to the coronavirus outbreak.   Though dog meat remains a delicacy in many regions, the ministry said dogs would no longer be considered livestock. It uses the livestock designation for animals that can be bred to provide food, milk, fur, fibre and medicine, or to serve the needs of sports or the military. ""As far as dogs are concerned, along with the progress of human civilisation and the public concern and love for animal protection, dogs have been specialised to become companion animals, and internationally are not considered to be livestock, and they will not be regulated as livestock in China,"" the ministry said in a statement.   COVID-19 is widely believed to have originated in horseshoe bats, and could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale in the wet markets of the city of Wuhan, where the pathogen was first identified. China subsequently banned the breeding, trading and consumption of wildlife, and revoked all existing licences. It also promised to revise legislation to make the ban permanent.   The draft guidelines, which have been opened to the public for consultation, listed 18 traditional livestock species — including cattle, pigs, poultry and camels. It also added 13 ""special"" species that would also be exempt from wild-animal trading restrictions, including reindeer, alpaca, pheasants, ostriches and foxes.   Dog consumption has become increasingly unpopular in China, and the southern city of Shenzhen became the first to ban it last month. However, the Humane Society International, an animal welfare group, estimated about 10 million dogs a year were still killed in China for meat, including stolen pets. The city of Yulin, in the region of Guangxi, holds an annual dog meat festival in June.   ""This draft proposal could signal a game-changer moment for animal protection in China,"" said Humane Society International spokeswoman Wendy Higgins. Reuters    ",,"April 10, 2020"
8,/news/2020-04-09/cyclone-harold-vanuatu-damage-fiji-tonga-coronavirus/12136018,Tonga braces for Cyclone Harold damage after destruction in Fiji and Vanuatu,"As Vanuatu and Fiji emerge from a trail of destruction left by Tropical Cyclone Harold, Tonga is bracing for damage as the category five storm passes the island kingdom.    The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, passed by the south of Tonga this morning (local time). The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued warnings for the Tongatapu and 'Eua island groups with expectations of hurricane-force winds of up to 117kph. There are also warnings of gale force and strong winds for the Ha'apai, Tele-ki-Tonga and Tele-ki-Tokelau island groups and Vava'u, Niuatoputapu and Niuafo'ou islands. The meteorological service said it expected a damaging ocean swell to batter all of Tonga as the storm moves south-east.   Tongan National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) has advised people to stay away from coastal areas and avoid sea travel until the storm passes.    It is forecast to move out of Tongan waters and downgrade to a category three storm by 7:00pm (local time).   In Vanuatu, the devastation is widespread.  Power and water supplies are still down and the majority of homes have been damaged in some way, leaving many homeless. Christina Boelulvanua and her family were among the thousands of people who fled volcanic eruptions on Vanuatu's Ambae island back in 2018. But the tropical cyclone has smashed her new life to pieces.   ""It's so depressing for me and the family. I ran away from the volcano with my kids thinking 2020 would be safe but then came Cyclone Harold,"" she said. Ms Boelulvanua lives in Banban, a community set up for volcano evacuees in the island of Santo. Nearly everything in Banban has been flattened by Harold's winds. Every house has been damaged and food gardens are wiped out. ""Now it's all gone. All the bananas are down, yams are down. So it will take time before we start all over again,"" she said. Like many in Vanuatu, Ms Boelulvanua depends on her garden to feed her family. She told the ABC her family would eat the scraps the cyclone has left them, but she doesn't know what they'll do once it's finished. ""Some people who have paid jobs can still survive from buying food from the shop, but [for] others who depend on food crops, I can't see how they can survive,"" she said.   Fiji has begun assesses the damage left by Harold, which moved out of the country's waters overnight. Images and vision have emerged showing widespread flooding on the main island Viti Levu. Residents have also reported that roofs were ripped off buildings and roads blocked by fallen trees.     Fiji Red Cross director general Ilisapeci Rokotunidau told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the initial damage from the cyclone was far more severe than anticipated.   ""We didn't predict the amount of saturation there was on land. The floods came up quite quickly and into areas we didn't anticipate,"" Ms Rokotunidau said.  Naziah Ali, who lives in the town of Ba — located in the north-west of Viti Levu — told Pacific Beat her town was engulfed.  ""The town is flooded, most of the shops that you see open on a Wednesday have been closed and boarded up,"" she said. ""I can already envisage how much damage there's going to be to goods and other materials people have in their shops.""   She added that she saw widespread crop damage to nearby farms and sugar cane fields.    The damage from Harold has made Fiji's management of coronavirus more complex. The country has 15 confirmed cases. ""We are doing all of this amid COVID-19 restrictions, so a lot of the [country's] movement has been restricted,"" Ms Rokotunidau said.  ""One of the things we have stressed to our volunteers is their own personal safety as they prepare to [help families].""  She said she hoped the Australian Red Cross would donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to Fiji's Red Cross volunteers as they assist in the recovery effort amid COVID-19. The Australian Government has provided the Solomon Islands with more than $99,000 of emergency assistance funds, while New Zealand has also joined Australia in providing more than $480,000 in financial assistance to Vanuatu. A defence jet will leave Australia later today to deliver cyclone relief supplies to Vanuatu.  Australia has also confirmed an offer to Fiji of damage surveillance and humanitarian relief supplies. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told a press conference this morning that officials were ""assessing"" what immediate impact Cyclone Harold was having on Tonga.  ""We stand ready to provide what further help we can to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" she said.   Australia is working with the Red Cross and other NGOs to provide supplies like tents and water containers in Vanuatu. It is also helping with damage-assessment flights. The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP. The Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu was aboard one of the damage-assessment flights and she was joined by the Vanuatu country director for the NGO World Vision, Kendra Gates Derousseau. ""Houses were essentially pulled to pieces rather than just wind damage. It was catastrophic,"" Ms Gates told the ABC's Pacific Beat.   Ms Gates Derousseau said that eight of her staff ""had lost everything"", including one pregnant staff member who had to run for cover with her family.  ""[She] described [being] in the middle of the cyclone, having to take her two young children by the hands and run about 100 metres to another house because a large tree had fallen on her house,"" she said.  With the double-whammy of managing coronavirus mitigation and cyclone recovery, Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu's full recovery would take years, and would need international help.  ""Given the COVID-19 crisis, I would anticipate that at least the economy will take many years to start again, particularly because Santo [Island] was a massive tourist destination,"" she said.  ""The north of the island is also the big agricultural centre. So there will be significant damages sustained because of the loss of crops and the loss of the ability to both internally and externally export. ""[But] the Vanuatu people are proving themselves resilient, [and] they will need international assistance to continue with that journey.""

Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas' hospital in London on Sunday evening (local time) with a persistent high temperature and cough caused by COVID-19, and was transferred to intensive care on Monday. The 55-year-old British leader, who tested positive for the new coronavirus nearly two weeks ago, has received oxygen support but has not been put on a ventilator. ""The latest from the hospital is that the Prime Minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving,"" Mr Sunak said at a daily coronavirus news conference. ""I can also tell you that he has been sitting up in bed and been engaging positively with the clinical team.""   US President Donald Trump, who said he had spoken with unnamed representatives of the United Kingdom, added that Mr Johnson appeared to be ""doing much better"". ""I just spoke with the representatives of the UK and I think that their great Prime Minister is doing much better today, or at least better,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""But certainly he has had a tough bout and he is still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better, and that's good.""   While Mr Johnson is out of action, the UK is entering what scientists say will be the deadliest phase of the outbreak.   The number of coronavirus-related deaths hit a new high on Wednesday, with 938 deaths in 24 hours, putting the total national death toll at 7,097. But the number of new infections and hospital admissions was starting to show signs of flattening, said Stephen Powis, the medical director of the National Health Service. ""We are beginning to see the benefits (of the lockdown) I believe. But the really critical thing is that we have to continue following instructions,"" he said.   ""We have to continue following social distancing, because if we don't the virus will start to spread again."" The Government is pondering the question of when to lift lockdown measures that are playing havoc with the economy. Mr Johnson's designated deputy, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, will chair a meeting on Thursday to discuss how to deal with a review of the lockdown measures. Britain's uncodified constitution, a collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents, offers no clear, formal ""Plan B"" if a prime minister is incapacitated.  In essence, decisions have to be made collectively by the Cabinet. Should Mr Raab become unwell, Mr Sunak will be the next in line to take over. Reuters    ",,"April 09, 2020"
10,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-intensifies-anti-foreigner-sentiment-in-china/12128224,"As coronavirus sparks anti-Chinese racism, xenophobia rises in China itself","As people of Asian descent face xenophobic attacks worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, foreigners in China are also increasingly reporting incidents of hostility and discrimination.   A comic posted to the popular social media platform Weibo last week, entitled An Illustrated Handbook on How to Sort Foreign Garbage, depicted foreigners being thrown into waste bins and disinfected by people in hazmat suits for supposedly breaching China's strict lockdown restrictions. One vignette depicts a dark-skinned man in a rubbish bin, with a caption reading: ""I was invited here, and cannot meet this small request [to follow quarantine rules] at all.""       Foreigners in the comic are targeted for ""disposal"" for a range of other alleged immoral acts, such as publicly praising China but secretly posting anti-China opinions online, scamming Chinese women into providing sex and money, and attacking health workers after testing positive for coronavirus. ""The epidemic prevention work has not yet finished. I didn't expect to have to sort foreign garbage again,"" laments one of the hazmat-clad officials. ""If you don't want to wear masks, go back to your home country."" Paul Mozur, a reporter for the New York Times based in Shanghai, tweeted that ""two weeks ago I was called 洋垃圾/foreign trash while quietly eating at a restaurant. These cartoons inflame already nasty sentiment."" It's not the first time foreigners have been depicted as a threat to public safety. In 2016, local officials in Beijing ran a public awareness campaign cautioning Chinese citizens against dating foreigners, who they claimed could turn out to be spies.   As it has claimed to have the pandemic under control, the Chinese Government has increasingly emphasised the threat of imported cases.   The number of new cases appears to have stabilised in China while skyrocketing in the US and Europe, but the official figures from China have been brought under scrutiny. For example, a Washington Post report last week suggested that the death toll in Wuhan alone could be as high as 42,000 — 16 times the official total. China's National Health Commission this week reported there had been no new domestically transmitted cases of COVID-19, and that all of the 32 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported on Monday were from overseas.  For the first time since the pandemic began, no new deaths were reported. While Beijing slammed Australia's decision to issue a ban on travellers from mainland China back in February, the Chinese Government closed their borders to all foreign nationals last month in an attempt to stop a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.  In a statement issued on March 26, the Foreign Ministry said it had decided to ""temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals holding visas or residence permits"".    Kynan, an Australian based in Shanghai who asked to have his surname withheld, told the ABC ""if I leave now I'm like banned indefinitely."" Around 90 per cent of imported cases in China have been returning Chinese nationals, according to official data.   Nevertheless, foreigners have reported being visited especially by local party officials or police to ensure they are abiding by quarantine restrictions. As businesses reopen, a fear of expatriates spreading COVID-19 also appears to be motivating some shops and restaurants to bar them from service. Jim Boyce, a Beijing-based restaurant reviewer, tweeted a shop's sign near his house in the Chinese capital reading: ""We do not accept foreign friends."" RF Parsley, another expatriate based in Beijing, posted a video of himself being turned away from a barber shop. Workers there told him they had been instructed by local officials not to serve ""foreign friends"". Canadian national Kyle Hadfield has lived in China for 14 years and runs an online group for expats. ""There has been a big increase in animosity towards foreigners and expats in China during the coronavirus outbreak, especially over the last couple of weeks,"" he told the ABC. People would weave away from him on the footpath or walk out of a lift as he entered, Mr Hadfield said.   ""Foreigners are being considered as a virus."" ""When a Chinese person overseas has a sign saying, 'I am not a virus', I kind of feel like I want to wear the same sign here,"" he said. Mr Hadfield, who has a wife and a daughter who are Chinese, said it is disheartening that he was facing xenophobia in the country he considers home.   Last week, three foreign nationals reportedly jumped the queue for COVID-19 testing in China's eastern city, Qingdao, which angered local residents and caused a stir on social media. The People's Daily, a state-run newspaper, condemned the behaviour in an editorial, arguing that foreign citizens should not enjoy ""special treatment"". ""China always attaches great importance to the safety and health of foreign nationals in China and protects their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with law,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian when asked about complaints of rising xenophobia this week. ""China opposes all forms of discrimination and prejudice.""   Foreigners' alleged refusal to wear protective face masks is another point of frustration among many. Last month, an Australian woman was fired and ordered to leave China after she breached lockdown conditions to exercise outside.   The case caused widespread anger on Chinese social media, with one Weibo user commenting: ""Our nation won't welcome people who don't respect our regulations."" Even the state-run Global Times newspaper reported that the pandemic was leading to ""unhappy or suspected discrimination experiences"" against expatriates. Kynan said, however, that he had not experienced discrimination. ""Can't say I've felt much difference here in Shanghai,"" he said, adding that he'd ""been to a few restaurants and bars which have been all fine apart from checking my [temperature].""   US President Donald Trump has been accused of fuelling hate crimes against Asian-Americans by insisting on calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"".   Chinese state media and senior officials have, meanwhile, promoted conspiracy theories, including that the disease originated in the United States or Italy, rather than China. The Australian Human Rights Commission recently told the ABC that around a quarter of people who have lodged complaints about racial discrimination in the past two months have been targeted because of COVID-19. A video posted to social media this week appeared to show an Australian man verbally abusing people outside the Chinese consulate in Sydney. ""Combatting the epidemic requires tackling its darker sides,"" said Fernand de Varennes, the UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues, in a statement.   ""Firm actions by states and all of us to safeguard the human rights of the most vulnerable and marginalised, including minorities, Indigenous communities and migrants, are urgent and necessary,"" he said.  ""COVID-19 is not just a health issue; it can also be a virus that exacerbates xenophobia, hate and exclusion.""    ",By Max Walden and Samuel Yang,"April 09, 2020"

The lockdown, implemented on March 22, has resulted in a ""significant improvement in air quality in the country"", as revealed by data analysis from India's Central Pollution Control Board. The report showed air quality in 85 cities had improved significantly as most vehicles remained off roads and non-essential businesses closed.  The report said: ""Data shows that on average, Indian cities had an AQI [Air Quality Index] of 115 between March 16 and 24."" ""The air quality started showing improvements from the first day of the 21-day lockdown. The average AQI fell to 75 in the first three days of the lockdown.""   Dozens of residents from the Jalandhar district in Punjab took to social media to share crystal-clear views of the snow-capped mountains, thanking the improved air quality for the awe-inspiring snaps. The mountain range is the world's highest with elevations of more than 8,000 metres, and includes the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest.   Some residents claimed it was the first time they had seen the peaks.   According to the latest figures from India's health ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has passed the 4,000 mark with more than 100 people dead so far. India has a population of around 1.3 billion people, with one of the world's most polluted cities, according to IQ Air pollution researchers. Ghaziabad, an area close to New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, had been ranked as the world's most polluted, with an average PM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019.  The microscopic particles, known as PM 2.5, are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, and are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system of a human.   Air pollution over China also plummeted in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to NASA. NASA and the European Space Agency's pollution monitoring satellites detected a significant decline in the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China since the lockdown. ""There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus,"" NASA said in a statement. According to NASA, the reduction in NO2 was first apparent near Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, where millions of people were quarantined. Environmental researchers also noticed air pollution levels plummeted in the Asia Pacific with carbon emissions also expected to drop, according to the Australian National University.

The bombs, dropped by pilots flying Sukhoi Su-22 military planes and a helicopter, contained poisonous chlorine and sarin nerve gas that affected 106 people in the town of Ltamenah, investigators said. The special investigative unit was established by members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in 2018 to identify perpetrators of illegal attacks.   Until now, the OPCW had only been authorised to say whether chemical attacks occurred, not who perpetrated them. Officials in the Government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its military backer Russia have repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and accuse insurgents of staging attacks to implicate Syrian forces. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement it was ""the latest in a large and growing body of evidence that the Assad regime uses chemical weapon attacks in Syria as part of a deliberate campaign of violence against the Syrian people"". Washington also assessed that Assad's Government retains enough sarin and chlorine and expertise ""to use sarin, produce and deploy chlorine munitions and develop new CW (chemical weapons)"", Mr Pompeo said. There was no immediate reaction from Damascus to the report. In Moscow the Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   The OPCW Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) said the 50th brigade of the 22nd air division of the Syrian air force dropped M4000 aerial bombs containing sarin on the town and a cylinder containing chlorine on a hospital.   The raids were conducted from the Sharat and Hama air bases, it said. ""Military operations of such a strategic nature as these three attacks only occur pursuant to orders from the highest levels of the Syrian Arab armed forces,"" the IIT report said. While individuals were identified by the OPCW investigators, their names have been redacted from the report, which was to be circulated to the OPCW's 193 member states on Wednesday. ""There are reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrators … were individuals belonging to the Syrian Arab air force,"" OPCW team leader Santiago Onate-Laborde said. The IIT is not a judicial body and it will be up to OPCW's members, the UN secretary-general and the international community to ""take any further action they deem appropriate and necessary"", OPCW chief Fernando Arias said.   In April 2018, an attack on the Syrian town of Douma led US President Donald Trump to carry out missile strikes on Syrian government targets with the backing of France and Britain. Created in 1997, the OPCW was initially a technical body to enforce a global non-proliferation treaty. It has become the focus of diplomatic conflict between Syria and Russia on one side and the United States, France and Britain on the other. ABC/wires",,"April 09, 2020"
13,/news/2020-04-09/how-bernie-sanders-lost-to-joe-biden/12135900,Why Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic presidential primary to Joe Biden,"The year was 1981. The place was Burlington, Vermont. And Bernard Sanders had just been elected the city's mayor by 10 votes, a race so close, and so full of novel ideas, that it drew national attention. ""The problem with the word socialism is that very often it gets equated to what's going on in the Soviet Union — with authoritarianism and totalitarianism and so forth,"" he said in the chanty cadence and shouty tone he'd come to be known for. ""Do I believe the profit motive is fundamental to human nature? The answer is no. I believe the spirit of cooperation is stronger.""   Had you placed those Sanders comments in the year 1991 or 2016 or 2020, no-one would have blamed you. Since that interview, the advent of his 40-year career in politics, Sanders has never once shied away from his ideas, using nearly every moment of his adult existence to fight for principles Americans consider too radical to put into practice. His will of belief was seen as his strongest asset by his supporters. But it may well be the reason he couldn't get the party to rally around him in the end. On Thursday he ended his second (and likely final) campaign for president, opening the door for his moderate rival Joe Biden to win the nomination and take on Donald Trump. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn in economic stagnation, watching America roil with protests and sit-ins, freedom rides and notions of change.   He lived in the thick of it, travelling to civil rights demonstrations and working as a political organiser, finally venturing into politics in his late thirties and successfully transforming a struggling small town into a blossoming city.  His popularity in Vermont landed him 16 years in the US House of Representatives, then three terms as a US senator. Though Sanders filled those offices as an independent, he almost always voted with the Democrats. His decision to run in 2016 was with that party in mind. He felt American progressives weren't hearing his far-left ideas. ""This is not an individual thing, this is not a personal thing,"" he said in a 2013 interview with Politico. ""It would be a disaster for this country to go through a campaign where you had candidates who are not talking about the collapse of the middle class, growing wealth and income inequality, growth in poverty, global warming."" He worried about the consequences of a failed run, but in the end, believed he had a decent shot of beating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. The establishment either did not, or did, and dreaded it. Coverage of his campaign launch ran on page 21 of the New York Times.   But by the end of that failed run, Sanders had become a household name thanks to a certain strength: voters knew what he stood for. Clinton put it this way in her campaign memoir, What Happened: ""I have a new appreciation for the galvanising power of big, simple ideas."" When Sanders announced he was running again in 2019, the New York Times ran the story on its cover.  The senator raised more than $US18 million [$29 million] through small, individual donations in his first six weeks of campaigning.   That fundraising power would continue to propel Sanders to the top of the historically big and diverse field of candidates. But all the while the moderate wing of the Democratic Party was still sceptical of Sanders' beliefs, and even progressives thought he had obstacles to the nomination. One was the belief that Sanders, age 78, was too old to take on the nomination. Those worries amplified in October when he suffered a heart attack, the kind of health disaster that would end other candidates' campaigns. For Sanders, the medical emergency was shortly followed by a rise in the polls, thanks in part to the strength of his campaign surrogates. The first rally Sanders held after his heart attack was headlined by Democratic darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   He only gained ground from there, earning endorsements from hundreds of celebrities and influencers and becoming the most popular candidate with Democrats under the age of 35. Even with that popularity — or maybe because of it — some worried that Sanders' stubborn commitment to progressive ideals could never do enough to unify the Democratic base. ""Everyone's just talking about electability,"" one Sanders supporter told the ABC ahead of the nation's first democratic nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. ""I'm putting my money on Biden, and I'll vote for him if he's the one that can beat Trump."" The first two primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire were messy, but Sanders walked away a winner in both. He defied expectations in the third, Nevada, by securing the normally-moderate Latino vote in overwhelming numbers. Turnout in the state broke records, in part thanks to Sanders' appeal. Everything changed with the fourth state, South Carolina, where 40 per cent of the Democratic electorate is African American. An overwhelming majority of that demographic coalesced around Joe Biden.   The win was so secure it was announced within the first two minutes of votes being counted. It'd be tough to overstate how critical this vote looked to US politics watchers. African American voters are among the most consistently Democratic, and a group historically shown to be harmed by a Republican president.   Though Biden heavily focused on African American voters throughout the campaign, his policies and voting record weren't always as favourable to them as they could be. With Sanders still preaching his big policies, Biden's win in South Carolina revealed that the voters at the core of the Democratic Party still had their minds set on one question: who would beat Trump?  Jason Johnson, former politics editor for the African American-focused publication The Root, put it this way: ""Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States."" The Democratic Party, too, started thinking about what white people would do in the general election.  The day before Super Tuesday, two popular moderate candidates dropped out of the race and threw their support behind Biden in a show of force against Sanders. Sanders' supporters were undaunted. In Los Angeles, more than 20,000 of them packed into an auditorium to hear him speak.   ""I think Biden did a lot of work in South Carolina … but people can't ignore the bloc of Sanders' support,"" one told the ABC then. Uncommitted voters believed differently. As Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, exit polls showed that an unusually high number of voters made up their minds 24 hours before voting, and a majority of those late-deciders chose Biden. In the US, concern about coronavirus hit suddenly and decisively around mid-March, pushing politics to the periphery in news bulletins but not necessarily in the minds of Americans. Healthcare was front of mind. So too was the economy. Presidential leadership mattered in a way it hadn't during the Russia probe or Ukraine scandal. With sports and TV shows cancelled, millions of Americans tuned in to the first one-on-one debate featuring Biden and Sanders.   Biden, aided by the lack of a cheering crowd, laid out step-by-step plans for how he'd fight the virus if he were president today.  Sanders stuck to the same policy ideas he always had, talking about redistributing wealth and overhauling the healthcare system. ""It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That does not solve the problem at all,"" Biden responded.  ""People are looking for results, not a revolution."" The next round of primaries again went to Biden. Then the next. Living through a world turned upside down, Americans went the way of South Carolina and decided they could no longer entertain the idea of a political revolution or a sudden shift to socialist policies. They wanted safety, security and predictability. They wanted Joe Biden. Three weeks and thousands of American COVID-19 cases later, Sanders concluded it would be better if he left the race to allow the party to unify around the presumptive nominee. ""Please know that I do not make this decision lightly,"" he told his supporters. ""If I believe we had a feasible path to the nomination I would continue, but it's just not there."" ""But let me say this very emphatically: As you all know, we have never been just a campaign. We are a grassroots, multiracial, multigenerational movement.""   It's the kind of thing that all politicians say when bowing out gracefully, but when Sanders says his campaign was more than a campaign, he really means it. The Republicans in Congress and the President may not have been thinking about Sanders when they passed the first coronavirus bill, but there are echoes of his platform throughout it: government-subsidised healthcare, unemployment insurance, tax cuts to gig workers.   The conservative governments of America's closest allies — Australia and the UK — have enacted similar stimulus packages despite standing opposite Sanders on the ideological spectrum. At a time when the world is at its most dark and desperate, leaders have turned to some of the ideas Sanders has promoted for decades. ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe,"" Sanders said at the beginning of his speech on Thursday. ""Together we have transformed, in the American consciousness, what kind of nation we can become."" He ended his remarks with a single pledge, as if it was ever a question in the minds of Americans — to keep fighting for what he believes in.  ",By Emily Olson in Washington DC,"April 09, 2020"
14,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-giant-pandas-finally-mate-during-lockdown-hong-kong/12136832,"After 10 years of trying, giant pandas finally mate during coronavirus lockdown at Hong Kong zoo","Everyone's handling the global pandemic in their own way.   You might be basking in your own filth watching the umpteenth hour of Netflix, or perhaps you're using all that spare time to try your hand at an ill-advised self-improvement project. Or, if you're anything like Le Le and Ying Ying, you're mating with your partner for the first time in a decade. The giant pandas, who reside at Hong Kong's Ocean Park, first began attempts at ""natural mating"" 10 years ago — but with the zoo now closed to the public due to coronavirus restrictions, it would seem the duo decided to make the most of their newfound privacy.   ""Since Ying Ying and Le Le's arrival in Hong Kong in 2007 and attempts at natural mating since 2010, they unfortunately have yet to succeed until this year upon years of trial and learning,"" Michael Boos, executive director in zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, said in a statement. ""The successful natural mating process ... is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination.""   According to Ocean Park, the pair began ""spending more time playing in the water"" and leaving ""scent markings"" around their enclosure towards the end of March, coinciding with the beginning of the panda mating season, which lasts until May. If successful, Ying Ying could show signs of pregnancy as early as late June — although the zoo notes that she could also experience a ""pseudo-pregnancy"". ""We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year and make further contributions to the conservation of this vulnerable species,"" Mr Boos said. According to the World Wildlife Organisation, there are just over 1,800 pandas left in the wild.      ",By Bridget Judd,"April 09, 2020"
15,/news/2020-04-09/is-asia-about-to-be-hit-by-another-wave-of-coronavirus-infection/12131944,"How bad could a second wave of coronavirus infections be, and where could they strike?","It is highly likely the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak will shift multiple times around the globe until a vaccine is found.   That is according to public health experts, who are warning that returning to normal life too quickly could risk a new wave of infections.  Even countries previously praised for their success containing the initial outbreak, such as Singapore and Japan, are now bracing for what some scientists fear is the second wave. The director-general of the International Vaccine Institute in Korea, Jerome Kim, warns that while some countries were considering relaxing measures to deal with the virus, the threat was far from over and remained unpredictable. ""It's really not over until it's over because just as easily the wind can shift and before you know it, the fire is back in your backyard,"" Dr Kim told the ABC from Seoul.   ""The epidemic is really like a fire. It passes through an area and hopefully it's gone forever. ""But we're pretty sure that it won't take much. It will take one person or two people going on a trip, being exposed for whatever reason, and coming back."" Professor Rob Moodie from the Melbourne School of Population Health at the University of Melbourne is among those monitoring the situation in Asia and Africa.   He also warns that we need to strike the right balance when it comes to keeping social distancing in place. ""We're going to get in a situation … [where we have to look at] the balance between is the cure worse than the disease? And that is the ultimate dilemma that we're facing right now,"" Professor Moodie said.  ""What is our end game in any country? When can we start to open things so people can get together again so they can protect their livelihoods? We don't know that yet."" Public health experts are also concerned about potentially ""rampant"" outbreaks in other parts of Asia, as well as Africa, meaning the epicentres of the virus could shift continually.   ""I think it's very likely to happen,"" Singapore-based Australian professor James Best from the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine told the ABC. ""There are other countries in Asia — India for example — and Africa where there could be a rampant outbreak as there has been in China initially, and then Italy, Spain, the US. ""As some of those countries go through the peak … there will be other places where infections spread and [they] will be the so-called epicentre. I think it's inevitable.""   Dr Kim said unless a vaccine or other preventative measures are developed, life will not return to normal. ""If we want to return to some situation like it was before, we're going to have to live with these outbreaks and respond to them quickly,"" he said. ""No one should feel completely safe from a COVID-19 recurrence."" After a slow rise in infections over the first three months of the year, Japan has now declared a state of emergency to deal with a sharp increase in cases.   Singapore's Government has this week ratcheted up a series of measures, including shutting down all workplaces, schools, and non-essential services, due to an increase in locally transmitted infections.    Professor Teo Yik Ying from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore described the second wave of cases as a ""rapid"" escalation which was ""deeply concerning"". ""Our second wave actually came from Singaporeans and permanent residents returning from countries that saw widespread community transmission,"" Professor Teo told the ABC. It is largely believed Singapore and Japan's health systems should cope with the second wave, and Professor Teo points out an increase in infections was anticipated by Singapore.    Professor Best said it was unlikely to experience a severe outbreak again given Singapore had already shown it had been able to ""flatten the curve"" to ensure the health system could cope.  ""If you have exposure within the population steadily over a period of six months, the system is able to cope with that,"" he said. ""People go into hospital or intensive care, they recover, and then the next wave is able to use those facilities."" But for Professor Best, the concern is if the waves of infections never stop. ""It's a huge burden on the healthcare professionals and they're going to be burnt out,"" he said. Authorities are facing a unique set of challenges as they try to anticipate and mitigate the spread of the virus.   Some experts suggest countries with dense populations — including India, Indonesia and the Philippines — could be at a disadvantage as they struggle to implement social distancing measures on a larger scale. Africa and Latin America are in the same boat, despite having so far reported low case numbers. Dr Kim said it is difficult to know at this point how severe the problem really is in those areas. ""It's really going to be important to know because in the end, Australia could be deciding to let go of some of the restrictions but if there's ongoing infection in South Asia or in Africa, Australia will never be completely secure."" Professor Moodie said the recent rise in cases shows countries need to take aggressive measures to contain the spread for prolonged periods and be able to put out ""spot fires"".   ""I think what we'll see now is [multiple] epicentres, much more than a global epicentre,"" he told the ABC. ""What we're going to see, particularly in Africa, is that it will bubble up and explode in many different countries."" Professor Moodie told the ABC the success of each country against the virus will depend largely on their wealth, their government, and their health system. ""I think we're in for a COVID era that is much longer than we originally thought,"" he said.   ""We'll see a second or third or fourth [wave] — that's what happened with the Spanish Flu as well."" More than 30 companies and academic institutions are understood to be working to create the vaccine for COVID-19.    Dr Kim said while a vaccine might be 12 to 18 months off, after that comes the question about which countries are prioritised for the vaccine.   ""Especially in the beginning, everyone is going to want it, but not everyone is going to be able to get it first,"" he said. ""This is the time to really think through the priority.""

16,"/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-could-cause-240,000-deaths-in-indonesia/12131778","Coronavirus is on the verge of exploding in Indonesia and 240,000 could die","Almost no-one thinks Indonesia is handling the COVID-19 pandemic well. Until early March, the government claimed it had no cases of infection, something the eccentric health minister Terawan Agus Putranto attributed to prayer.  The Home Affairs Minister urged the public to eat more bean sprouts and broccoli, while President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) sang the praises of jamu, traditional herbal remedies. The government had been in denial. Terawan dismissed as ""insulting"" a report by Harvard University researchers saying Indonesia must have unreported cases. As recently as last Friday, another minister was still arguing the virus cannot survive in tropical climates. Jokowi was apparently more concerned about the threat the virus posed to trade, investment and tourism.  In February, when many countries were imposing tough travel restrictions, he planned to offer discounts of up to 30 per cent to attract tourists. His government even allocated almost $8 million to pay social media influencers for tourism promotions.   On March 2, Indonesia finally acknowledged COVID-19 had reached the archipelago.  Jokowi admitted, as many suspected, his government had withheld information from the public ""to avoid panic"". And then it finally began to act. The government banned mass gatherings, imposed so-called ""large-scale social restrictions"" and barred foreigners from entering the country. It announced it will release 30,000 prisoners from the country's notoriously overcrowded and unhealthy prisons and will spend an additional $40 billion on medical needs, social support and relief for small and medium businesses Last week, Jokowi even toyed with the idea of declaring a civil emergency (similar to martial law) before quickly backtracking. It is not hard to see why Jokowi finally admitted what most Indonesians guessed long ago, but we still don't have all the facts. Indonesia has recorded more than 2,400 infections and 209 deaths, but these figures are based on just 11,500 tests, a tiny sample in a nation of nearly 270 million.   There are indications many cases and deaths are going undetected. Reuters examined data from Jakarta's Department of Parks and Cemeteries and found 4,400 burials were conducted in the province in March, an increase of 40 per cent above normal levels. But even by the conservative official figures, the mortality rate of 9 per cent is one of the highest in the world, although this could be because of insufficient testing. In any case, scientists at the University of Indonesia have predicted that if stricter measures do not start immediately, the situation could spin out of control, with up to 240,000 deaths by the end of April. Tragically, widespread testing, proper treatment and tough and effective social isolation measures are unlikely to happen soon. The government is scrambling to prepare its health system to cope, but this looks like an impossible task. Indonesia has just four doctors and 12 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and less than three intensive care beds per 100,000. These levels are way below World Health Organisation or Asia-Pacific standards. An extreme shortage of ventilators will likely result in many avoidable deaths, especially in regional areas.   A specialist COVID-19 hospital has been opened in Jakarta, and the old Vietnamese refugee camp on Galang Island is being refurbished to create another. But it will take a lot more than this if hundreds of thousands are infected – not least because Indonesia is a respiratory disease tinderbox. It has one of the highest proportions of male smokers in the world, and its five leading causes of death are all tobacco-related. The bad relations between the Ministry of Health and doctors won't help either. There is also a serious lack of protective equipment for health care workers. Some have been told they can turn up to work in raincoats.  At least 24 doctors have died so far, about 11 per cent of all recorded deaths.   Even social isolation will be extraordinarily difficult in such a densely populated country with a laissez-faire attitude to rules and a tradition of bribing police.  Moreover, up to 70 per cent of the workforce is employed in the informal sector and many live hand-to-mouth. Working from home may simply not be an option for them. To make matters worse, millions have been preparing for mudik, the traditional visit home for Muslims in the lead-up to the Idul Fitri (Eid) celebration on May 23.  Last year, more than 18 million Indonesians travelled during this time. It is hard to imagine an event more likely to trigger a catastrophic outbreak.   Jokowi has warned of the dangers of mudik, but seems reluctant to take tough measures to prevent it. He is in no-win situation. If he does ban mudik he will be a target for criticism from political enemies who like to portray him as an insincere Muslim. If he doesn't, he will be attacked for exposing millions to the virus. Already, Anies Baswedan, the high-profile governor of Jakarta, has criticised Jokowi's handling of the crisis, calling for much tougher measures to reduce the spread of the virus. But Jokowi appears to have again put economic considerations before public health, opting instead for ""large-scale social restrictions"" rather than quarantines or banning mudik outright.   Stricter regional quarantines or lockdowns would undoubtedly depress economic activity. What's more, under the 2018 Health Quarantine Law, the government would then incur the huge costs of being responsible for all the basic needs of citizens in those areas. It would also concern Jokowi that the virus has triggered an outburst of anti-Chinese hate speech, never far below the surface in Indonesia. Online trolls are accusing the Chinese of introducing the virus to Indonesia and wealthier Chinese of fleeing to the safety of Singapore. There have already been violent protests against Chinese workers in a number of locations. Jokowi's close association with former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian, coupled with the president's determined courting of Chinese investment, will make Jokowi vulnerable if anti-Chinese sentiment escalates further.   Jokowi has now brought in the police, armed forces and national intelligence agency to help manage the crisis. This is in line with the creeping securitisation that has marked Jokowi's rule, and these agencies will take any opportunity to gain a greater foothold. But it also suggests Jokowi is aware of the political dangers COVID-19 may create for him. Worryingly, the police seem more concerned with chasing down the president's online critics than taking actions that might help to prevent the spread of the virus. The Indonesian government has a mess on its hands — one largely of its own making.  Sadly, its people will likely pay a very high price for the months its leaders spent denying the obvious.

17,/news/2020-04-08/asia-pacific-students-migrant-workers-travel-stuck-coronavirus/12105458,Migrant workers and international students stuck in Australia due to coronavirus travel bans,"Asty Rastiya hasn't seen her children in almost three months.    The Indonesian mother of two, who came to Australia to study a PhD in journalism at Deakin University, spent that time renting a house and finding furniture: she wanted the home to be ""perfect"" for when her husband and two kids jumped on a plane from Indonesia to join her. But the coronavirus pandemic — and the global border closures surrounding it — has thrown Ms Rastiya's plans into disarray. Just like the hundreds of Australians trapped overseas due to nationwide lockdowns and grounded flights, migrant workers and international students have found themselves stuck in Australia, cut off from loved ones and facing economic uncertainty.   In Ms Rastiya's case, her husband and children were supposed to fly to Australia on March 22, but the Australian Government's travel ban for non-citizens and temporary residents, announced just three days before their planned departure, meant they wouldn't be allowed in.   ""My husband had resigned from his job. My family was ready to fly to Australia,"" she told the ABC. She said they scrambled to find another flight, but the ones they found were either too short-notice or too expensive. Getting home isn't a simple financial decision, either. Rastiya signed a 12-month rental lease (her agent and landlord have since offered some rental relief), and receives an allowance through the Department of Foreign Affair's (DFAT) Australia Awards Scholarship while studying in Australia. ""I wouldn't get my allowance if I decided to go home and would create another problem instead,"" she said. ""When I look at the people around me who lost their jobs, it made me feel guilty to just think about my feelings, so it's better for me to stay.""   She's also fearful of contracting the virus while travelling and then spreading it in Indonesia, which has more than 2,200 cases and almost 200 deaths. ""I wouldn't know whether the people who I meet in the airport have been infected, [whether] the things I'd touch [are contaminated with the virus] and I might carry the virus home,"" she said. She's also terrified for her family in the world's fourth most populous nation, where cases were slow to be detected and which, one study suggests, could have 250,000 infections by the end of the month unless strict physical distancing measures are taken. ""I'm very, very, very worried about them. I keep thinking about my parents as they are very vulnerable,"" she said. ""I can't do anything. I can only check on them by phone, through video call and keep reminding them to not leave the house.""   ""I'm so thankful to have a supportive husband, I had always underestimated him when it comes to taking care of our children,"" she added, holding back tears. ""He has sacrificed many things to send me [to Australia], and I just feel I would be too selfish if I decide to go home."" Neang Saran, 24, spent some of her childhood in a Cambodian orphanage. When she found out she'd be coming to Australia for a year to study a diploma in business, she couldn't wipe the smile off her face.   ""It was unbelievable. It was like a dream come true, because I was always thinking about coming — like applying for scholarships to study in Australia, get new experience in working life and experience in a new country. That was my dream,"" she said. She arrived in Australia a month ago and undertook preliminary English classes. But just one week in, the school was shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Going back to Cambodia would be difficult — the country has closed its land borders to stem the spread of COVID-19.  There are no direct flights between Cambodia and Australia and some transit hubs, like Thailand, have banned entry to foreigners.   Ms Neang's scholarship had included accommodation, but as it is now on hold, she is stuck in Melbourne without any means of supporting herself. For now, she's relying on the kindness of some acquaintances for a place to stay and food.   ""I feel like I'm lucky that I know people here who have a beautiful heart and are kind to me, but if I hadn't known them I would be homeless,"" she said. She's worried about her family and friends back in Cambodia. The country has just over 100 cases, but a more severe outbreak could overwhelm its already under-resourced healthcare system.   ""The health system in Cambodia is not as good as here … and also I am worried about my family financially,"" Ms Neang told the ABC. Before arriving in Australia, she was working in Phnom Penh as a digital marketing and communications officer and was using about half of her wage to support her family.  Her mother is financially dependent on her, and her brother is trying to put himself through university in Cambodia. She had planned to work part-time while studying so she could support herself and also send money back to her family. But job opportunities quickly dried up, with businesses closing as the coronavirus spread.   Her plans for entrepreneurship in 2020 have stalled, but Ms Neang still counts herself lucky that she can talk with her family on video calls ""to see them every day and bring back my smile"". ""Things changed and I don't know what to do … It's not only me but everyone that is having trouble,"" she said. ""But I'm OK. I'm trying to think in a positive way so I can feel better and not be upset."" Lizzie Meng is an Australian citizen, but for the past decade, China has been her home.   She and her three children have been living in China since 2010, but when the COVID-19 epidemic was first declared there earlier this year, she flew to New Zealand. As new COVID-19 cases dwindled in China and began to skyrocket in other parts of the world, Ms Meng decided it was time to take her children home, via Australia. But the family of four were stopped by the Australian Border Force while transferring at Sydney Airport, one hour after the ban on all Australian citizens and permanent residents travelling overseas came into force at midday on March 25.   Ms Meng said she wasn't aware of the travel restrictions before she arrived in Sydney.   ""I immediately crashed and cried when I heard about [the travel restriction],"" Ms Meng said. She didn't have any friends or relatives in Sydney, so decided to fly to Melbourne, where they are currently undertaking 14 days of self-isolation.  ""I was so touched for our friends treating us like we were their families,"" she said. Ms Meng said she still wanted to go home, despite the risks of contracting COVID-19 during long-haul flights and airport layovers.  ""The global pandemic might not be finished until Christmas. Don't I need to go back to where I live in China?"" she said, adding the children also needed to go to school. ""I have to go with the risks."" The Department of Home Affairs was approached for comment and directed the ABC to recent announcements about allowing migrants on the Pacific Workers Scheme to extend their visas by 12 months. Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said there has always been an expectation that temporary visa holders and first-year international students are able to support themselves. However during the crisis international students who have been in Australia longer than 12 months will be able to access their superannuation. ""For those people who are foreign nationals here on a temporary basis … if you cannot support yourself in Australia, then please consider departing the country, going home where you can get that support,"" he said in a press conference on Saturday.

18,/news/2020-04-08/as-wuhan-reopens-some-fear-another-wave-of-coronaviru-infections/12129228,Wuhan is beginning to lift its coronavirus restrictions but some still fear another wave of COVID-19 infections,"It's taken 76 days, but the city where the devastating coronavirus pandemic all started is finally ending its lockdown. Millions of people will be able to leave for the first time since January 22. Zhu Yi travelled to the city with her family for Lunar New Year on January 20, only to be caught in the lockdown three days later. She's excited about the measures lifting. ""Wuhan people are very happy and excited because we have been locked at home for so long,"" she told the ABC. But what's become clear in recent days is this is no free-for-all, and the city is not returning to a normal state. There are still some restrictions in place for locals, as more than 1,000 people with the virus are still being monitored and treated.   China's Government will still be using hyper-vigilant measures to track and trap remaining cases.   Having got through the worst of COVID-19, authorities are not taking any chances in case of another outbreak. ""When we arrived here, no-one had any protection and everyone went out as usual,"" Ms Zhu told the ABC. ""People didn't realise how serious this virus was. I even took part in a family gathering with more than 50 people.""   In recent weeks, as authorities in Wuhan began relaxing restrictions, Ms Zhu and her family have been going outside and shopping at a supermarket — with strict social-distancing measures enforced.   She's deeply relieved that her family was unaffected by the virus. Others weren't so lucky. So far, 2,571 deaths have officially been linked to COVID-19 in the city, although many suspect there were more victims in the early weeks who died without being tested. ""In my wider circle of family and friends, I've heard of about 10 people who have died,"" she said.   While she's booked tickets to leave with her family back to the southern city of Shenzhen on April 12, others can't escape as easily.   People wishing to travel to China's capital require approval from local district governments in Beijing before they can buy a ticket. Nearly all people who leave Wuhan to other cities will face 14 days quarantine upon arrival. And only those with a ""green"" health rating on government apps will be permitted to leave. Those with 'red' or 'orange' ratings representing their level of coronavirus risk face further weeks or possibly months of restrictions. As of Monday, China's National Health Commission reported 574 current cases in Wuhan.   They didn't provide the location of a further 772 people who are currently under medical observation for testing positive to coronavirus without symptoms. It's likely most of them are in Wuhan. ""Since these asymptomatic people also carry the virus, they must be infectious, so we need to be cautious about them,"" infectious diseases specialist Liu Zhengyin told state TV this week. ""As Wuhan gradually lifts its restrictions for many activities, some sporadic cases may occur in the process, but since they appear sporadically, people should not panic.""   With China reducing flights and banning foreigners from entering the country, authorities hope they are catching all infected Chinese who fly into the country with coronavirus. Wuhan is not the only place having strict government measures lifted. In recent weeks, the rest of Hubei province — which was originally locked down with Wuhan — had movement restrictions also relaxed. But brutal clashes on a border bridge with neighbouring Jiangxi province in late March showed just how much difficulty and stigma residents of the province face.     Along with the stigma are the thousands that have been left to pick up the pieces. The relief that many feel about the end of the lockdown is being tempered by the grief thousands of families are experiencing. Last weekend, China designated a day of national mourning for the victims, flying flags at half-mast and pausing for three minutes. It was a departure from the heavily nationalistic coverage of recovered patients and heroic medical staff that state media had been circulating. But even afterwards, the coverage — produced under government orders to spread ""positive energy"" — has mostly concentrated on China's victory over COVID-19.   It's something many have struggled to come to terms with. For Wuhan resident Liu Ning, it's been hard to move on after losing his disabled brother in devastating circumstances. ""I received a call on February 12 from a community worker saying my brother had suddenly died, but they wouldn't say why,"" he said. ""They just told me both his lungs were affected and gave me half an hour to see his body before they took it away to the mortuary house for cremation"". February 12 was the worst day of Wuhan's outbreak, and Mr Liu's compound was under lockdown, meaning he couldn't leave or organise any transport to farewell his brother with such short notice. ""The welfare house said they couldn't send him to hospital because the hospital wouldn't accept him,"" he said.   Thousands of families can tell similar stories of losing loved ones to the virus or facing difficulties accessing hospitals for other critical ailments. Yet as the number added to the daily death toll has continued to dwindle, many have been focussed on celebrating the end of their lockdowns. But the world they face now will not be as it was before.

19,/news/2020-04-07/antarctica-climate-change-law-dome-hunt-for-hydroxyl-radicals/12110980,The hunt for hydroxyl radicals in Antarctica could reveal the secrets of our future climate ,"In every sense, gazing into an Antarctic time tunnel is a chilling experience. You lean over an icy entrance about the size of a dinner plate being exceptionally careful not to drop anything in.  It's hard to tell how far you are seeing. Five or 50 metres? A year, a decade, a century or more? As your eyes adjust they see beyond the snap-frozen present and deeper into the decades gone by.  The colour shifts from blinding white to electric blue and eventually to a darkness so unfathomable it could be a tunnel into deep space.  A core barrel is lowered into the cylindrical shaft, hanging on a cable. It travels at first through layers of hard-packed snow that still retain a connection to the atmosphere above.   Go deeper and those pore spaces close off under the weight of snow pushing down from above. The sheer compressive force compacts fluffy snowflakes into solid ice, trapping a tiny bubble of atmosphere from that moment.  Each bubble becomes a time capsule. The drill drops through the centuries, reaching for our pre-industrial past. To solve one of the enduring climate change riddles, we're going to need a lot of air from an awful lot of these bubbles.   In the summer of 2018-19, a team of Australian and US scientists headed ""deep field"" from the Australian Antarctic Division's Casey Station. They had set themselves a difficult challenge: haul hundreds of tonnes of delicate equipment, drilling rigs and enough supplies to the far side of distant Law Dome for three months to camp out in the ""home of the blizzard"". Their aim was to drill for a handful of atoms that could reveal how well the chemistry of the atmosphere had been removing problem greenhouse gases like methane. ""We know we're headed towards more [global] warming, but we don't know how exactly the atmosphere is going to behave as we continue to add more greenhouse gases to it,"" explains glaciologist Peter Neff.   Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by plants and absorption into the ocean, but it's a slow process.  Other warming gases like methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are more chemically active. They are partly removed from the atmosphere by a highly reactive, naturally occurring molecule called hydroxyl (OH).   ""The hydroxyl radical is sometimes called the detergent of the atmosphere,"" says atmospheric chemist Vasilii Petrenko.  Direct atmospheric measurements of hydroxyl only date from the mid-1980s. What climate modellers need is information back to the beginning of the industrial period so we can work out what OH was up to before we started adding to its workload with ever-increasing emissions. ""We know that it's probably been keeping up over the last couple of decades, but before that there's no information,"" adds co-investigator David Etheridge from the CSIRO. There would be profound implications if this extremely helpful molecule is found to have been losing its capacity to scrub the skies over time. Corrections would be needed for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it will continue to build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter, much faster than currently predicted.    About six years ago, Petrenko and his colleagues realised they might have found a way to uncover hydroxyl's secret history. A technique they pioneered in Greenland to analyse tell-tale carbon 14 (14C) atoms in ice cores had allowed the underlying sources of our rising methane emissions to be pinpointed.  If they could now mine enough ice as quickly as possible, they reasoned, and from just the right spot in Antarctica, enough trapped 14C atoms could be recovered to reconstruct the OH chemistry of the past.  Just the right spot meant Law Dome.    Law Dome is not the sort of place most sensible people would choose to pitch a tent. Even penguins don't visit.  The weather can be truly awful — think -25C on a summer's day. That's before you add in wind chill from storm-force gales that sweep the summit and blizzards dumping more snow here than nearly anywhere else in Antarctica.  ""A lot of snowfall comes off the coast, hits this very, very slight incline and dumps a lot of snow,"" Etheridge, an atmospheric scientist, shouts over a blizzard, ""about 4 metres per year, which is enormous by Antarctic standards. ""It's what we want, it's just not very comfortable.""  Life expectancy for an exposed human caught out in bad weather here is counted in minutes, not days.  Of course, it's not the endless views of a white nothingness that attracted Etheridge and the team of polar veterans to such a challenging place. The lure is lying directly under the thin nylon floor of our tents.    ""Law Dome is a stack of ancient snow that has been compressed into ice,"" Neff explains. ""The snow that accumulates here never melts so it's just this layer cake of years, with the most recent year's snowfall on top of the dome and then successively older layers at depth.""  We sleep on nearly a kilometre and a half of layered ice holding an impeccable atmospheric record stretching back at least 80,000 years.  Bounded by a pair of glaciers that drain ice from the enormous East Antarctic ice sheet, the 1,400-metre-high dome sits apart from the complicated ice flows of the continent like an island in a stream. Cores drilled here by Etheridge in the 1980s revealed, with unparalleled clarity, the rapid increase in greenhouse gases expelled over the industrial period. Now the team hopes to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through this same interval.  The team begins a military-style operation to extract ice cores in all weather conditions, with constant speed and absolute cleanliness.    The clock is ticking from the moment each ice core arrives at the surface. Cosmic rays start to create new radiocarbon atoms that can compromise the final counts.  ""We drill a lot of ice and then we destroy it really quickly in a very precise way to capture those ancient air bubbles that are trapped in the ice,"" says Neff.    It's a surreal sight. In the whiteout of a blizzard, Petrenko and Neff emerge from what looks to be a white circus tent dressed in white cleanroom coveralls, hauling precious blueish cores on a sled behind them to the melter shelter.  Here they process the ice, placing core after core in a giant stainless-steel vessel that looks part space capsule, part pot still.  ""The Hot Tub Time Machine — I thought that was an appropriate descriptor,"" quips Neff. ""Once the hot tub melts the ice, your time machine is there in those air bubbles."" Each of the 20 sled runs sees about half a tonne of ice loaded into the melter, yielding around 50 litres of ancient air per sample for processing back in the US and Australia. The deepest ice is retrieved from about 240 metres, holding air from the world of the 1870s — the time of Ned Kelly, Edison's first lightbulb and the dawn of the Age of Oil.   The problem for scientists is that there is absolutely no hydroxyl left in it. ""The hydroxyl radical is naturally produced in the atmosphere via what's called photochemistry,"" explains Petrenko. ""Hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive. They stick around for typically a small fraction of a second."" It's an instant reaction that helps scrub the atmosphere, but if an OH molecule in 1875 survived for less than a second, how can anyone hope to measure its fleeting existence so many years later?  Hydroxyl might be long gone but the air trapped in the bubbles should retain its lingering radioactive fingerprint in the form of individual carbon 14 atoms of carbon monoxide.    ""Carbon 14 monoxide is produced in the atmosphere through cosmic rays at a rate that we can pretty much understand,"" says Etheridge. ""It's removed almost entirely by hydroxyl. All we need then is to measure the concentration and we can balance the equation and work out the amount of hydroxyl.""  A year later, the processed gas samples arrive in a black plastic case at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Sydney. The timing is profound. Sydney is sweltering under a blanket of smoke from climate-fuelled fires burning up and down the coast. The ice was drilled during Australia's then-hottest summer on record. Now the air from it will be analysed during the Black Summer of 2019.    ""This carbon, if you put a price tag on it, is possibly the most expensive carbon there is on the planet,"" says Andrew Smith from ANSTO's Centre for Accelerator Science. Weight for weight, the atoms might be more expensive than diamond but their value to the world at large could be priceless.  ""Ten million dollars in the slot!"" Smith shouts over the roar of vacuum pumps as he loads a sample carousel into the ion source of the 10 million-volt ANTARES tandem accelerator. ""It's critical that we get this right … otherwise we'll have nothing."" Deep inside the machine, each sample in turn is hammered by a caesium plasma, liberating carbon 14 atoms and shooting them towards the detector at 10 per cent of the speed of light. The ANSTO accelerator runs for 50 straight hours. The tests deliver a good set of data and it's now a matter of interpreting the results. Over the coming months scientists will analyse how well hydroxyl has kept mopping up the pollutants we have been throwing at it over the last 150 years. We'll be able to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through the industrial age.   It could be that the final calculations will reveal hydroxyl continues to clean the atmosphere without hindrance. But the fear is that the ice reveals the opposite.  There will be profound implications if it's found that this detergent has been losing its capacity to clean the atmosphere over time. Climate modellers would need to make corrections for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it might build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter faster than currently predicted. ""We certainly are warming the planet,"" says Petrenko. ""The climate models are predicting [it is] going to result in things like sea-level rise and increases in extreme climate events, which are going to be dangerous and in some cases potentially catastrophic for our civilisation.""   Science, for the most part, is neither quick nor easy. Whether grappling with a viral pandemic or an angry atmosphere, both the scientific process and its practitioners construct an evolving framework of understanding based on evidence.  Now, more than ever, our civilisation depends on it. Watch Atom Hunters of Antarctica on Foreign Correspondent on ABC TV and iview.

20,/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-britain-stand-in-pm-dominic-raab-boris-johnson/12128110,"With Boris Johnson in intensive care for coronavirus treatment, Dominic Raab is his 'designated survivor'","Britain has entered a distressing new phase in its fight against the spread of coronavirus, with the Prime Minister among thousands who have fallen seriously ill. Boris Johnson is in intensive care with worsening COVID-19 symptoms which means he might not be able to run Britain during the height of the pandemic.  After initially telling people he had a ""mild"" case, his condition has clearly deteriorated.  He's now in a critical care bed, although we're being told he is still conscious and breathing on his own. His pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, cannot visit him as she is herself in self-isolation with COVID-19 symptoms.    With Mr Johnson in intensive care, it raises questions over what happens to the governance of 66 million people in one of the biggest crises since World War II. We've had a look at who is in charge and whether they have the same powers as the Prime Minister.      The line of succession for the Prime Minister in the UK is not as clear as it is in other countries, such as the US. There is actually no official constitutional post of deputy prime minister, so unlike in Australia, there's no obvious stand-in position in a situation like this. Instead, Downing Street named Mr Raab as ""designated survivor"" on March 23 when Mr Johnson first fell ill. Yes, but it's not quite the same as the TV show. As well as being the Foreign Secretary, Mr Raab is also the First Secretary of State, which makes him the obvious pick to be designated survivor and stand-in PM if the situation becomes graver.   However, there can be some dispute and competition over who can hold the position in the UK. According to local media reports, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove was pushing to be the PM's stand-in, so Downing Street was forced to make a choice. That was a huge concern for Peter Bone, a Conservative backbencher who has been calling for a law to clarify the line of succession in the UK since 2013.   ""Nobody seems to be able to tell me what happens if the Prime Minister is incapacitated,"" he told the Mirror newspaper.  ""In a national emergency, you don't want to be scrabbling around worrying about who's in charge. And you don't want the Foreign Secretary and the Cabinet Office Minister arguing about who's in charge."" The situation is now so serious that the Queen is being regularly informed of the Prime Minister's condition. The Queen's rallying speech to the nation on April 6 was dimmed somewhat by the news an hour later that Mr Johnson had been taken to hospital. There are various things that only the UK Prime Minister is authorised to do.   Some of these responsibilities could be taken up by Mr Raab without any issue, including making recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary, and to the Church of England.  Those kinds of tasks for the moment are unlikely to be pressing as most of the nation remains on lockdown. But there could be some times where the authority is not as clear cut. For example, according to the BBC it is harder to imagine him conducting a cabinet reshuffle — even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. And things seem to get even less likely as we get to the more significant prerogative powers. Mr Raab said a team of ministers and Whitehall officials were working ""full throttle"" to carry out the instructions of Mr Johnson from his hospital bed at St Thomas' Hospital in central London.   But when asked whether he had taken over Mr Johnson's ""security responsibilities,"" Mr Raab declined to comment.  ""We are getting on with all of the various strands of work to make sure at home and abroad we can defeat the virus and pull the country through coronavirus and the challenges that undoubtedly we're facing at the moment,"" he added.   Mr Raab entered the Conservative Party race to become leader last year but finished a dismal sixth in the contest before quickly backing Mr Johnson. Months later he finds himself overseeing the response to Britain's biggest crisis since World War II.  Like the Prime Minister, he's a vocal Brexiteer.  Both men supported the ""Vote Leave,"" pro-Brexit campaign, before the referendum on the European Union in 2016.   Mr Raab was first elected to Parliament in 2010 after working as an international lawyer and an adviser to the Foreign Office. He was a junior minister in former prime minister Theresa May's government before he was promoted to Brexit secretary in 2018. But he quickly became a thorn in her side and resigned several months later in protest over a deal she struck with the EU on Brexit. Mr Raab is seen to be skilled and combative but has courted some controversy in the past. During the leadership campaign, previous comments he'd made on feminism were raised again by journalists.    ""From the cradle to the grave, men are getting a raw deal,"" he said in 2011. ""Men work longer hours, die earlier, but retire later than women."" He defended those comments in 2019, saying there shouldn't be ""double standards"" when discussing equality between the sexes.   Most UK parliamentary experts believe that if Mr Johnson were totally incapacitated, Mr Raab would be his stand-in until the Tories elect a new leader and take Britain to an election.    In normal times, grassroots members of the Conservative Party would vote for a new leader, as well as MPs.  For now, though, Mr Raab insists that he is only carrying out instructions he receives from Mr Johnson in hospital.  ",By Europe correspondent Bridget Brennan and staff,"April 07, 2020"
21,/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-sweden-adopting-more-flexible-approach/12118422,Sweden is adopting a 'flexible' coronavirus response and betting on 'social obedience',"Jens Magnusson can continue with his daily life relatively undisturbed. If he wants to. Under the COVID-19 tackling approach taken by the Swedish Government, he can go to the gym, meet friends at a bar and join a bootcamp in park.   Sweden has so far recorded more than 400 coronavirus deaths — about 10 times as many as Australia. Its population is around half that of Australia. But its Government is standing by its relatively relaxed approach to the pandemic. Rather than telling people what to do — or, worse, telling them off — the Government is asking Swedes to do the right thing, and giving them the liberty to prove they are responsible citizens. While the Government has taken some measures, such as limiting social gatherings to 50 people and closing high schools and universities, experts say it is betting on Sweden's ""social obedience"". But that's a lot of trust to put in your people at a time of global pandemic, and a gamble that could have catastrophic consequences. By his own account, Mr Magnusson, 30, is an example that the 'recommendations, not restrictions' approach can work. ""I used to go to the gym three to four times a week, but I haven't been there since the pandemic ramped up,"" he said. ""Instead of going to the gym I usually go out for a run. ""I'm also cautious when out and about by keeping my distance from other people, and I haven't been out in bars since the virus started.""     He said venues in his home of Ostersund, a town of 60,000 people in the middle of the country, had been ""pretty much dead"" for weeks now. But when 30-year-old Stefan Nordenberg is strolling the streets of the Swedish capital of Stockholm with his son, they're anything but. ""I was out last weekend, walking, just having a look at a number of bars, and it was actually surprisingly busy,"" he said. ""But overall, even though everyone basically could be out, contaminating everything and infecting everyone else, the very vast majority of Swedes are staying at home.""   Mr Nordenberg said Swedes don't share the same kind of scepticism towards government that citizens in other countries do — therefore they're more likely to do the right thing, without being threatened with punitive measures. ""If the Government or the ministry that's in charge of people's health, if they say you should stay at home because that's what's best for all of us, people believe that. So, I should stay at home,"" he said. Because Sweden's Government has taken a vastly different, more flexible approach than many Western countries, including its Scandinavian neighbours, he sometimes feels ""torn"". ""If it turns out that Sweden gets through this pandemic quite alright, this will be a stroke of a genius,"" he said. ""It could [also] be that Sweden is just three weeks behind Italy and it'll hit us like a sledgehammer.""     If Mr Nordenberg has his doubts, his 74-year-old father Richard, a former navy pilot, puts unwavering trust in the Swedish Government's ""very reasonable strategy"". He said rather than isolating the whole society, the Government has put the onus on the elderly, asking them to stay home. And he does, with a few exceptions. Instead of meeting up with friends around town, they now hold video calls. But he hasn't refrained from taking the tube and visiting some family members. ""I'm not worried. I have no diseases, no weaknesses. I'm very healthy. I'm sporting,"" he says. Magnus Barnell thinks the world will benefit from trying different approaches for any future events. ""If it shows that our approach ultimately also can work, then it means that we can return back to normal society,"" he said. ""Whereas if it shows it doesn't work, then you will see more states becoming very restrictive [in future events].""   His wife, Nele, hopes that if at any point the Government realises the country is on the wrong trajectory, it changes course immediately. ""But at this point I don't think they have to take any harsher measures. I do believe that if they see things are changing, I believe that they would change their strategy,"" she said.   Experts say the Swedish Government is operating on the basis that it's beyond the capabilities of most societies to stop the spread of the virus without a vaccine. The Prime Minister's department told the ABC that in addition to introducing public gathering limits, the country had encouraged social distancing, especially among the elderly, and banned visits to aged care facilities. ""We want measures that work in the long run, since this pandemic likely will continue for months,"" the department said. ""Our approach is flexible, and we will implement stricter measures if necessary. ""At this point, our assessment is that people are changing their behaviour and [following] the recommendations."" Local media is reporting the Government is considering stricter measures.   Karolinska Institute epidemiologist Emma Frans said Sweden's response to the crisis stuck out like a sore thumb, when many other European countries have opted for some level of lockdown. ""I'm not sure it's the right strategy, but it'll be easier to maintain our strategy in the long run, compared to many other countries where they early on had a lockdown,"" she said. For a lockdown to be effective, and to avoid possible second waves of the virus, people must stay home for a year or 18 months, says Lund University Professor and epidemiologist Peter Nilsson. That, he said, is ""unthinkable"" and could lead to societal breakdown. ""Imagine you have a country with a complete lockdown — everybody is isolated for three, four months,"" he said. ""Then you lift it. The epidemic is still there. It will spread again. This is the problem. ""Besides that, a total lockdown will hurt the economy. If our society is damaged, there will be less money for health care in the future. ""People will not tolerate a complete lockdown for a very long time because they will have a mental breakdown. They will get desperate.""     Genetic epidemiologist Professor Paul Frank said the rate of the pandemic in Sweden did not mean the Government was letting the virus run its course. But the Lund University expert is worried people are getting complacent. ""When I look around, what I see are gatherings of older people,"" he said. ""I've seen local hotels having wine-tasting evenings indoors with older people present. What I don't see is a proper protection of vulnerable populations in this country. ""And that worries me because if you have a strategy where you're pursuing the spread of the virus to reach herd immunity, which some would argue Sweden is doing, then a very important part of that strategy has to be to protect the vulnerable to prevent them from getting infected. ""If you're not doing that, you'll have fairly widespread deaths amongst those vulnerable populations. I'm very, very worried about that.""    ",By Katri Uibu,"April 07, 2020"
22,/news/2020-04-07/boris-johnson-coronavirus-hospital-uk-leadership/12127854,Boris Johnson's battle with coronavirus begs the question: was the public told the truth?,"That the leader of one of the most powerful nations and largest economies in the world is now in intensive care with worsening symptoms of coronavirus is extraordinary.  Downing Street says Boris Johnson's condition worsened over the course of Monday afternoon, and his medical team advised that he be moved to ICU at St Thomas' Hospital in central London. That decision would not have been taken lightly. Downing Street had spent the past 10 days assuring the public that the Prime Minister was fit to govern and had ""mild"" symptoms of COVID-19.   The word ""mild"" was dropped in recent days. Just hours before he was admitted to intensive care, Downing Street was insisting Mr Johnson was still well enough to govern. But was he really?    The scepticism began to grow after Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, an announcement that was made just after the Queen had completed her special address to the nation. By Monday, the questions came thick and fast during the daily coronavirus update that was led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.   He was questioned repeatedly about whether the PM could continue to capably lead the country during a time of crisis while in hospital. Mr Raab refused to answer questions about tests and treatment, and on one occasion pointed to national security as a reason for no comment. He repeatedly said the British leader was in ""good spirits"". Then Mr Raab revealed he had not spoken to Mr Johnson since Saturday, one day before the Prime Minister was admitted to hospital, despite standing in for him on Monday's daily government coronavirus briefing.    That raised the suspicions of some of the most seasoned political journalists in the UK, including the BBC's Andrew Neil, who tweeted: ""Why has Mr Raab not spoken to PM since Saturday? Something not right here."" Sure enough, something was not right.    Hours later came the bombshell that Boris Johnson had been transferred to intensive care. A statement from Downing Street said the PM had asked Mr Raab to deputise for him ""where necessary"".     That means Mr Raab is now the interim head of government, because Boris Johnson is likely no longer fit enough to lead. He is not the deputy prime minister as it would be in Australia, but rather the First Secretary of State. Regardless, he can make decisions on Mr Johnson's behalf, including on security and the coronavirus response. Over the past 11 days, it's clear Downing Street went to extraordinary lengths to assure the people their leader was fine.  Even on Monday night, the message was that the move to ICU was precautionary —  Mr Johnson was not on a ventilator, and was conscious when he was moved there.  But the questions will come as to whether he was moved to hospital quickly enough, and whether the public was told the truth of his condition.    Medical experts have regularly pointed to a deterioration among some patients at the 10-day mark of the virus. Others, like Health Secretary Matt Hancock, seem to sail through with little drama. Mr Hancock was diagnosed at the same time as Mr Johnson. He is 14 years younger than the British leader, and returned to work and started fronting press conferences days ago.    Since then, Mr Hancock has been front of the campaign to urge people to stay home as the weather in the UK improves after a long winter.  Mr Johnson's turn for the worse will likely focus the minds of those who have perhaps been taking the threat too lightly.  For now, his battle is a very personal one.

23,/news/2020-04-05/bali-tourism-dependent-economy-collapsing-coronavirus/12112348,Bali's tourism-dependent economy is 'collapsing' due to coronavirus travel bans,"Mangku Nyoman Kandia has been a tour guide in Bali since 1984. He says he's lost track of the number of people he has taken on tours from around the world, but nothing has prepared him for this. ""No tourist, no money,"" he said simply. There are few places in the world where hospitality and tourism are as ingrained in people's psyche and development than Bali. The Indonesian island's colourful culture and religious norms have been shared with millions since it was first discovered by international travellers.   But earlier this week, the Indonesian Government declared a state of emergency due to the global coronavirus pandemic. It announced it would ban all foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, from entering the country. Many of Bali's 4 million residents have been relying on the tourism industry for generations, but with people staying home due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, its residents are struggling. ""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy … it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mr Kandia said. ""[Economically] it's currently much worse than the Bali bombings and the Mount Agung eruptions."" Preliminary figures from Bali's international airport shared with the ABC show a steep drop in both arrivals and departures in the last two weeks of March.   On April 1, only four international flights arrived and departed from the airport — a more than 95 per cent drop compared to the same day last year. In 2019, there were more than 1.3 million Australians who travelled to Bali — a love affair stemming back to the 70s that has seen many return for cheap holidays, retirement or for business opportunities.   Now the bustling street vendors have shut up shop, the once-packed beaches are deserted. With many hotels closed, thousands have been left to grapple with a new reality. I Ketut Ardana, head of Bali's branch of the Indonesian National Organisation for Tours and Travel (ASITA), told the ABC almost all tourists had left the island, and those left behind were stuck and hoping to get home. ""Eighty per cent of people in Bali rely on tourism whether directly or indirectly,"" he said. ""All of us in the industry are really struggling right now, what we're waiting for is for this pandemic to end.""   Mr Kandia is now living off his dwindling savings and doing odd jobs including construction work, sweeping streets, and driving ride-shares to stay afloat. He said there were around 7,000 tour guides in Bali like him who were out of a job, and like many others in Asian nations, stay-at-home orders were hard to follow when living hand-to-mouth.   ""From [earlier this week] good Samaritans have been giving out boxes of rice to 500–1,000 gig economy drivers,"" he said.  ""Hotels, villas and restaurants are starting to close, there have been no activities.""   Kevin Adhipramana was only three months into his two-year contract at a five-star resort in Bali's tourist hotspot of Kuta before he, and hundreds of others, were told the hotel would close indefinitely. ""We were at less than 10 per cent occupancy before the hotel finally announced it would close on April 1,"" he told the ABC. ""I'm now looking for any available work. Regardless of the situation, we all still have daily needs.""   Hospitality is not the only industry taking a hit. Bali has become an increasingly popular location for destination weddings in recent years, but the outbreak has forced many couples to cancel their ceremonies. Govinda Rumi has been a wedding photographer for almost a decade. He told the ABC most people had cancelled their weddings this year. ""Most of my friends who work in international weddings rely solely on tourists,"" he told the ABC.   ""There's zero income … I cannot see another wedding for me this year, because even if it gets better, people aren't really spending that much money."" He said there were around 5,000 wedding photographers in Bali, but there were also many wedding planners, florists, caterers, event hire companies and decorators who were now out of work. ""Photographers are staying alive by setting up home kitchens, or delivering food … so it's time to get creative to survive,"" Mr Rumi said.   Tourism accounts for 10 per cent of Indonesia's total workforce, employing more than 12 million workers, many of which are in Bali, according to 2018 data from the World Tourism and Travel Council. The Indonesian Government announced three separate economic stimulus packages worth a total of $40 billion to keep Indonesia's economy afloat during the pandemic, including tax breaks and specific subsidies for companies and individuals.   They have also announced an online upskill and training initiative with financial benefits for those who are economically impacted by COVID-19 in three regions, including in Bali. However, there are many people who still cannot access the program, or do not qualify, leaving it up to local councils to provide food handouts to those in need. Sam Huang, professor of tourism and services marketing at Edith Cowan University, said the ""unprecedented"" devastation on the tourism industry extended much further than Bali. ""Tourism businesses are finding a very hard time now as a lot of national and state borders are closed and people's mobility is tightly controlled to curb the spread of the coronavirus,"" Professor Huang said.   ""The financial costs would be huge.""   He said in Australia, the income from inbound tourism could drop by two-thirds compared to last year.  ""For nations and regions that heavily rely on tourism in their economic structure, the loss is even bigger,"" he said.  Professor Huang added that tourism industries may only be able to recover after two to four months from the time the pandemic is declared over by the World Health Organisation. ""This pandemic gives us a lesson to reconsider what the appropriate proportion of tourism in a country or region's economy [is],"" he said.  ",By Tasha Wibawa,"April 05, 2020"

Separate from her televised address, the Queen had a message for Australia delivered through Governor-General David Hurley.  ""At a time when people across the Commonwealth are experiencing a profound and rapid change to their lives, the pain of lost loved ones, and an understandable concern about the future, my thoughts are with all Australians,"" she said in a statement.    ""Whilst it can be difficult to remain hopeful in such challenging times, especially following the summer's devastating bushfires and recent flooding, I am confident that the stoic and resilient nature of the Australian people will rise to the challenge. ""I extend my sincere admiration to the many Australians who work tirelessly to help those affected, provide essential services for their fellow citizens, and continue to care for the most vulnerable. ""You will remain in my prayers in the coming months, with the resolute knowledge that with hard work, faith and unity, we will rise to the challenges ahead and ensure the health and vitality of all Australia's communities. ""I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.""   In her message broadcast in the UK, the Queen gave special thanks to those workers tackling the crisis at its forefront.  ""I want to thank everyone on the NHS [National Health Service] front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all,"" she said.  ""I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times. ""I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones. ""Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it."" The highly anticipated message was only the fifth time the head of state had made a televised address outside of her usual schedule. Usually, the Queen only addresses the public during her annual Christmas Day message and at the State Opening of Parliament each year.  Her addresses outside of this schedule have mostly been in response to troubled times. She spoke following the death of the Queen Mother in 2002, Princess Diana's death in 1997 and the first Gulf War in 1991. The Queen also gave a speech to mark her Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Today's message was pre-recorded at Windsor Castle, where the Queen and Prince Philip moved on March 19 — a week earlier than the pair usually do for the Easter break. The recording happened under special circumstances in the castle's White Drawing Room where social distancing could be observed and the only other person in the room, a BBC camera operator, was wearing personal protective equipment.   The Queen's son, Prince Charles, spent a week self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus on March 25. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also tested positive to the virus.  In a statement published shortly after the Queen's address, Downing Street said Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital for tests as a ""precautionary step"".   The Queen said she hoped people would deal with the crisis with ""self-discipline"" and ""quiet, good-humoured resolve"". ""I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge, and those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any,"" she said.  ""Across the Commonwealth and around the world, we have seen heart-warming stories of people coming together to help others, be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbours, or converting businesses to help the relief effort. ""And though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation. ""It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. ""Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.""   ""While we have faced challenges before, this one is different,"" the Queen said.  ""This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed — and that success will belong to every one of us. ""We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."" The address came after a challenging weekend for the UK, where the death toll from the virus rose by 621 in the past 24 hours to 4,934. High fatalities are still expected to continue this week. Britain, which has recorded nearly 48,000 cases, is in a state of virtual lockdown, with people told to stay at home unless it is essential to go out. Health Minister Matt Hancock said even stricter rules might be imposed if the current rules to curb the spread of the virus were ignored.

25,/news/2020-04-05/coronavirus-is-russia-lying-about-its-infection-rate/12118056,Russia says its coronavirus outbreak is extremely small. Vladimir Putin's critics say that's a facade,"Last week, Vladimir Putin came face to face with the coronavirus and emerged unscathed. Nobody was surprised.  He'd been seen on Russian television, touring a hospital and standing just centimetres from a doctor who later tested positive. However, according to the Kremlin, tests showed ""everything was OK"" with Mr Putin. While the 67-year-old President may indeed be fit and well, a positive test result would not have been in keeping with his strongman image.   For 20 years, he has cultivated a hero-like persona, competing in judo, scuba-diving, driving tanks, firing weapons, fishing and horse riding. Tackling coronavirus within Russia will require a heroic effort, but for Vladimir Putin, the risks are enormous. ""This is a stress test for the Russian system,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow in Chatham House's Russia program. ""This could be a sort of a swan-song scenario for the Kremlin, if they mess up with the response,"" he said. While residents of major cities have been told to stay at home, Australian expat Jason Fenton, who lives in St Petersburg, said some people weren't taking the threat seriously.   ""Not everyone is adhering to the self-isolation,"" he said. ""If I go to a supermarket, I need to go late at night to avoid the crowds."" Mr Fenton, who runs a web development business, said he'd seen some examples of panic buying. ""Initially, when they announced that the borders to Europe were going to be locked down, things like buckwheat, pasta and rice sold out very quickly,"" he said. ""But toilet paper [shortages]? We're not having that problem.""   He said in recent weeks, he'd even heard some people joking about the virus by saying: ""It's OK, we drink vodka. We already have the medication."" It's easy to see where that complacency comes from.    As of April 3, Russia had 3,548 officially confirmed cases of the coronavirus with a total of 30 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. While that number increased significantly in recent days, it's still relatively low, considering Russia has a population of 146 million people and shares a vast border with China and Europe.   Russia's efforts to control the virus may have indeed given it a head-start.  It shut its border with China in January and progressively closed other crossings throughout March. However, serious cracks in Russia's defences emerged last week when Moscow's Mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said infections were likely to be much higher than official figures suggested.  Russia's Doctor's Alliance, a union group with links to opposition figure Alexei Navalny, also accused the Government of deliberately hiding the number of infections — accusations the Kremlin denied. ""They have a habit of fiddling with figures,"" Mr Boulegue said. The Russia expert doubted the Kremlin would pursue a large-scale cover-up of cases, but would instead try to shield the President from the situation if it goes badly.   On April 2, the President addressed the nation, telling Russians that a paid non-working week would now last a month in order to ""win time"". ""The peak of the epidemic in the world has not yet been reached, and in our country as well,"" Mr Putin said.   While Mr Putin has made national addresses and posed for photos, he has left many of the tough announcements about lockdowns and other restrictions to others. This is a deliberate strategy to ""shift responsibility"", according to Mathieu Boulegue.  ""[Putin can say] that if your region gets a massive outbreak, it's not the fault of my government, it's the fault of your region. So blame your [regional] government,"" he said. Officials in Moscow have extended a partial lockdown until May, banning people from leaving home unless they're buying food and medicine.    The crisis is already creating major political headaches for Mr Putin, who has been forced to delay a constitutional vote that would allow him to remain in power until 2036. If the virus takes hold in poorly resourced regions with struggling health systems, it risks breeding ""wider discontent"", Mr Boulegue said. ""This is something the Kremlin needs to avoid at all costs. They can't face a social crisis that comes in the middle of power transition discussions."" Despite creating enormous challenges for Russia, the pandemic has created opportunities for Vladimir Putin.   Following discussions with US President Donald Trump, Mr Putin arranged for a planeload of medical supplies to be flown to New York. It was a ""very nice"" gesture, Mr Trump said. It was also a chance for Russia to portray itself as a generous and capable world player, coming to the aid of the United States.   ""This is nuts,"" tweeted Andrew Weiss, vice-president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Hopefully someone will tell Trump that he's playing right into a propaganda ploy."" The Russian military has released several videos of its forces disinfecting aged care homes in northern Italy.   It's also sent planeloads of equipment to Italy, which some diplomats believe is another attempt to exert influence in Europe, where newly enforced border restrictions have created divisions. ""Russia's trying to probe European solidarity. It's very self-serving,"" Mathieu Boulegue said. Mr Putin has also suggested sanctions against his country should be relaxed, in light of the pandemic. ""Ideally, we should introduce a moratorium, a solid moratorium on restrictions on essential goods as well as financial transactions for buying them,"" he said. The Russian President seems determined to make the best of a bad situation. As he said in a televised address earlier this week: ""God helps those who help themselves.""

26,/news/2020-04-05/betio-facing-overpopulation-crisis-sea-wall-hope-of-survival/11975240,"Betio is facing a population crisis, and a sea wall could be its only hope of survival","Carly Learson is in the Pacific supporting UNFPA, the UN's sexual and reproductive health agency, which seeks to ensure that women, girls and young people have access to essential services, with a special focus on areas impacted by the climate crisis. On a sandy islet engulfed by greenery, Esther lives under constant threat. But it's not violence she's most concerned about — it's disease.  Not coronavirus — Kiribati is one of the few countries without a single case. But the threat of disease hounds Betio, the most populated section of South Tarawa, an island in Kiribati, where there are around 15,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. To put it into perspective, that's 2.5 times the density of Tokyo. ""The beach used to be way back there — I don't know how many houses have been lost but it's a lot,"" says Esther, who moved to Betio from a remote island with her family. ""Now everyone is crowding into this area. There's no privacy, people are going to the toilet on the beach, and there's the constant threat of disease outbreaks.""   Here, families live in open shacks on around four square metres of land, where the distance between houses is a matter of centimetres.  These sorts of crowded conditions contribute to some of the worst health outcomes in the Pacific: tuberculosis and leprosy are rife in Betio, with thousands of cases detected and treated each year.  Few countries are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming than the Pacific islands of Kiribati.  A group of atolls spread across millions of square kilometres of ocean, the islands have lost more than 10 per cent of their land in just two years.    Kiribati is made of sand and reef rock, materials that easily erode, causing houses built close to the water to collapse when there's a strong storm.  There's no basis to build strong foundations, and those families who become homeless due to erosion have to find a new block of land further inland.  ""There's currently no provision for land lost to erosion, and while we have ordinances for land use in places like Betio, they're not being enforced,"" says Taneka Redfern from the Office of the President. The constant scramble to find a place to live has meant that parts of South Tarawa have the among the highest population density in the world.   In the absence of other options, residents of Kiribati are putting their faith in sea walls. All over the island, young people are bringing in cement and rocks to build up new walls that will stop the tides from reaching their houses, however temporarily.    There's also a plan to dredge up millions of tons of sand from the lagoon and move it to a section of the island that can be built up to three metres in height, in theory providing space for 35,000 people to live.  In the meantime, people are living with the everyday reality that their land is disappearing.  ""The President doesn't want us to move, and the only place we could go would be Ocean Island (a remote island only accessible by ship), but that won't work,"" says Teakamatang, a community leader in Tebikenikora, or Golden Beach. ""We need a sea wall that will last at least 20 years... Hopefully by then we'll have a better idea about what we can do.""   For younger people, who can't remember the way the island used to be, there's a greater degree of complacency.  Christina, from Tebikenikora, says that while young people build sea walls, they're mostly doing it because they're told to by their elders.    The 28-year-old adds that she can't see a future for her and her husband in Kiribati, although she doesn't know where else she would go.  ""The sea wall will protect us, but everyone will only work hard when there's an emergency — it's really hard work,"" she said.  ""It's the elderly people who are angry — they can remember a time when they could live off the land."" For those that have felt the effects of the growing crisis, however, the need for action cannot be understated. After Betio hospital — which handles up to 60 births each month — found itself at the mercy of the elements four years ago, the concrete sea wall proved a lifeline.   ""We had a storm and the water came all the way into the hospital. We had women giving birth, or recovering with their newborns, and they all just had to run,"" says midwife Makita. ""There were three new mums asleep in the clinic when a massive wave bashed against the window. It was really frightening for them."" With finite land on Kiribati, the country's woes demonstrate the challenging nexus of climate change and overpopulation. And it's not a problem likely to end anytime soon.    According to the World Meteorological Organisation and climate scientists globally, extreme weather events are becoming much more frequent. For Kiribati, this means extreme storms and droughts. Storms cause flooding, and on such flat land, floods can devastate thousands of homes very quickly.  There have already been two floods this year. Teakamatang, who has witnessed the waters rising over the past 30 years, does not mince words. ""If nothing is done, we will disappear.""  ",By Carly Learson,"April 05, 2020"
27,/news/2020-04-04/how-new-york-was-badly-hit-by-coronavirus-covid-19/12114976,Coronavirus has seized control of New York. Here's why the city may never be the same again,"New York, of all places, should have seen it coming.   The melting pot. The city that never sleeps. The concrete jungle where dreams are made manifest in structures of shiny metal. Say 'New York' and the mind conjures up crammed subway cars and swarming sidewalks, shared taxi rides and shoebox cafes. Eight million movers and shakers live in an area totalling 480 square kilometres. And 55 million more visit annually from faraway places, carrying faraway contagions. You don't need a medical degree to see why the crown jewel of American cities is an infectious disease's idea of Disneyland. At the time of writing, more than 51,810 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in New York City. More than 1,375 had died, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the 6,055 total deaths in the United States. Experts say it could be another three weeks until we see the peak toll. Journalists who committed to calling it the ""coronavirus epicentre of the US"" are now testing out ""epicentre of the world"". A month after its first coronavirus casualty, New York is seeing clearly what it missed before — and watching the virus seize control over a place once defined by freedom.   New York's army of medical professionals knew right away they weren't ready for the inevitable attack. More than 11,000 of the most critical patients crammed into hospitals that collectively, only contain 3,000 intensive care beds.   Supplies dwindled so rapidly that doctors have had to ration treatment and make calls as to who should receive it. Three nurses themselves have died from a lack of protective equipment and nearly 200 are sick. Aline Reich is one of them. The paramedic from the Bronx tested positive for COVID-19 after weeks of seeing an uptick in cardiac arrest calls and now is quarantined at home with two young children, struggling to breathe. ""We just have to be very close to patients to assess,"" she said.  ""But we're literally out of everything we should have to protect ourselves. We're dropping our standards just to do what we need to do."" ""Every day, our lives and our families' lives are at risk. I hear a lot of people saying, 'You signed up for this,' but I don't think we signed up for deciding who should live and who should die."" Reich said she planned to resume working after two weeks without symptoms. In her 12 years as a medical professional, she has never seen a situation with so many unknowns. ""We live in a place where we feel we can pass anything, but this is coming to get everyone,"" she said. ""This is not going to stop. Honestly, I'm scared.""  Mayor Bill DeBlasio declared this Sunday (local time) to be ""D-Day"" because the city expected to run out of key supplies, including life-saving ventilators. Yet New York is only just now discovering the full extent of who needs saving.   It was four weeks ago that Governor Andrew Cuomo first publicly called on the federal government to provide functioning test kits after the first ones came back inconclusive. With New York being the kind of place that takes matters into its own hands, the state swiftly authorised private labs to do testing and asked private companies to design and distribute 500,000 kits. The first batch only arrived this week. As of Wednesday (local time), New York state had tested 220,880 individuals, far more than any other place in the US. Some say that the relatively high testing rates inflate the sense that New York is far worse off than other US locations. Local authorities say they're not trying to hide the reality, and in a city where space is a premium, they couldn't even if they tried.   Federal emergency teams began assembling tents for field hospitals in Central Park and converting old warehouses and conference centres into makeshift infirmaries.   A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship also arrived in the city this week, floating down the Hudson River like a beacon of hope as hundreds of onlookers broke social distancing guidelines to watch. Bob Cooley, a photojournalist who's covered New York for 21 years, was one of those compelled to capture the boat's arrival, knowing it'd be a moment the city would remember. He'd been tracking the ship online for the three weeks it took to gather a crew and sail over. When it finally swept into the bay, he snapped photos on a pier with a view of the Statue of Liberty, where 30 strangers were practicing social distancing.   But even standing 3 metres away from his neighbours, it was impossible not to feel a sense of solidarity that has been absent since the pandemic's onset. ""Initially it was just a boat that was coming in,"" Cooley said. ""But then you saw the medical professionals actually on the boat, standing in a row across the top. That's when everyone started cheering and waving and applauding. ""It was the first time I'd seen people breaking the silence of social distancing … there was this sense of human connection that we needed."" Two days after the USNS Comfort docked, New Yorkers started seeing and sharing reports that it wouldn't be accepting coronavirus patients. In fact, only 20 non-COVID patients have been admitted for care thanks to the same bureaucratic measures that led to the city's shortage of supplies and space in the first place. The US Navy says the 49 rules around patient admittance are unlikely to change. For now, the mighty ship still sways in the harbour, cavernously empty, a spectre of the hope it used to be.   Elsewhere in the city, the prevailing symbols of the crisis were grim from the start. A new fixture throughout the city is the presence of ""mobile morgues"" — refrigerator trucks stationed outside hospitals to store corpses. Alix Monteleone can see one below her third-floor apartment in Brooklyn. She and her fiance first noticed it a week ago, and realised its purpose when they overheard a nurse say, 'Yo, there's mad bodies in there'. At first, the truck was totally exposed, and her view was crystal clear. The hospital has since constructed fences and awnings to give the dead a bit more privacy, but Monteleone can still hear the electric hum of refrigeration and the clatter of construction crews building shelves.  ""If we're seeing this chaos outside the hospital, my heart breaks for what must be happening inside,"" she said.  Those 45 morgues can hold 3,600 bodies collectively. Eighty-five additional trucks are being sent to the city this week because the death toll is expected to exceed 16,000. Monteleone has already noticed another truck added to the liminal space below her window. The shock of it all is starting to fade.  ""My fiance has lived in this apartment for seven years. For New York standards, it's very large. The rent is right. We have so many windows, which was a blessing up until now,"" she said.  ""The prospect of moving is just not on the horizon … This is just a reality we're having to adjust to.""   Monteleone is just one of many who are surprised by the speed at which the city has been turned upside down It wasn't even three weeks ago that New Yorkers were ignoring early guidance and kept doing what they do best — getting from point A to point C. On the weekend of March 14, hordes of New Yorkers were still bar-hopping, brunching and buzzing through their daily routines with such dedication that one writer chose the blunt phrase, ""gathering in groups right now is selfish,"" as a headline. Early data comparing New York to San Francisco suggests that the five-day lag in declaring shelter-in-place orders led to 15 times the number of infections. Many of the same New Yorkers who defied those early warnings may now lose the income to support the social lifestyle they had before. The city is yet to release its latest unemployment numbers, but a website used to file claims across the state saw a 900 per cent increase in traffic over a five-day period at the end of March. It caused the site to crash and led to a subsequent 16,000 per cent rise in phone calls to the department's hotline. The Governor ordered a 90-day moratorium on evictions because an estimated 40 per cent of city residents won't be able to pay rent this month. Andrea Brown, who moved to Williamsburg from Sydney about 10 months ago, is one of those residents who's negotiating with her landlord this week after seeing a pay cut. ""We don't want to leave, but we don't want to be paying this rate for the next six months with my new salary,"" she said. ""We pay $US4,100 ($6,841) per month [for a one-bedroom] … it's a big financial burden in terms of being able to save for, say, a flight back to Australia if need be.""  Others assessed the situation and decided it was indeed time to leave the city, taking the threat of the virus to other parts of the country or the world, without promising to return.     As the most densely populated city in America, New York may have been uniquely vulnerable to coronavirus, but there was nothing unique about the way it met the threat. It's merely a microcosm of America's overall response to the virus. ""Other states should be looking to us because we're the canary in the coal mine,"" Mr Cuomo said solemnly this week. ""This is unlike anything you've ever seen before. ""This spreads like fire through dry grass with a wind behind it … You will see this move across the country. New York is just first.""   This week, the US shifted its attention away from the navy ship and the mobile morgues to watch New Orleans surface as a rising hotspot. Then it was Chicago. The rise of cases in Detroit, Michigan has authorities particularly worried because they're paired with economic stagnation. But the same could be said for the numbers in Florida, with nearly a quarter of the population over 60 years of age. Texas is looking shaky. New Jersey is getting bad. And Wyoming is the only state not to have a fatality. New York may have been caught off guard as the first, but it knows now it won't be the last, and that knowledge weighs heavy on its mind.  The city that thinks it's the greatest in the world wants you to know there's no guarantee it'll be exceptional on this one. As one resident put it, ""Right now, we're all neighbours.""

28,/news/2020-04-04/tiger-king-netflix-series-is-capitalist-fever-dream/12114106,"Tiger King, Netflix's new true crime series, is a wild ride into the modern American psyche","OJ Simpson was shocked. ""Oh my God,"" he said on Twitter this week.  ""Is America in this bad a shape?"" He was talking about Tiger King, a docuseries that launched on Netflix two weeks ago and is currently the most popular title on the platform in Australia. When even OJ Simpson, who basically invented using popular culture to distract from your criminal history, thinks this is all a bunch of absolute insanity, it makes you pause. Here's why everyone is talking about Tiger King and what it can teach us about the modern American psyche. You've probably seen people recommending Tiger King as a coronavirus-anxiety balm, expressing disbelief at its lunacy or just nonchalantly sharing memes featuring Joe Exotic, the self-described ""gay, gun-carrying redneck with a mullet"". The seven-part series traces the exotic animal market in the United States and, in particular, the small private zoos that showcase those animals to the public. It's partly an examination of the kind of people who do this in a country where loose regulation has led to exploitation, captive breeding and all-out fiascos like the one in Zanesville, Ohio, in 2011, where dozens of exotic animals were shot after being released from a private zoo. But it's also — because this is Netflix — a true-crime drama. There's a murder-for-hire plot and a millionaire who disappeared and may or may not have been fed to tigers.   Then there are the characters.  Hoo boy.  Where to start with them? Joseph Maldonado-Passage, who calls himself Joe Exotic, keeps more than 200 tigers in a ramshackle ""roadside zoo"". Because this is America, he also keeps a film crew that shoots an internet talk show (fronted by him) and makes tiger-themed videos for his country music side-hustle (not a joke).   He is also, we learn in the first episode, mixed up in a plot to have a fellow zoo-owner murdered. ""There was something so odd about the man, and yet he had so much confidence, because he owned the world in his head,"" Rick Kirkham, who was Joe's on-site TV producer, says. It is exhausting trying to recount the various ways in which these people are unbelievable. Joe's mentor is fellow zoo owner Bhagavan ""Doc"" Antle, a ponytailed former Hollywood exotic animal handler with very little in the way of humility and a doctorate in ""mystical science"".   Aside from keeping exotic animals, he keeps women — possibly, the directors suggest, against their will. He has several ""partners"", who have their own residences on the grounds of his zoo in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  One former employee recounts being worked seven days a week and pressured to get breast implants, eventually relenting only so she could get a few days' rest. ""He would say, 'They're free to leave,"" the former employee, Barbara Fisher, says of Antle's female companions.  ""But that's the way it is in all cults."" While he claims to love his animals and adhere to US Department of Agriculture guidelines, he also subjects the cubs to petting by humans and engages in cross-breeding, both of which are discouraged by animal welfare advocates.   Then there's Carole Baskin. Baskin appears at first like the show's baseline of integrity, an ageing Floridian hippie on a quest to shut Joe Exotic down because, she says, he abuses animals and engages in irresponsible breeding practices. But the series questions not only her prior breeding and animal acquisition practices but covers more salacious ground: that she is reportedly the prime suspect in the disappearance of her wealthy husband, Don Lewis. There are many small private zoos in the United States — what are known as ""roadside zoos"". Often, according to the Animal Legal Defence Fund, they keep exotic animals in poor conditions because state and federal regulation is poorly enforced or provides too many loopholes. The situation is the same when it comes to private ownership.  In some US states, there's less paperwork involved in getting a lion than a dog, according to reporting by National Geographic magazine.  The trade in exotic animals has been booming in recent years, due in part to social media. The World Wildlife Foundation estimates there are 5,000 tigers in the United States, most of them in private residences. That's one of the largest populations anywhere in the world. You can't import exotic animals, but those rules overlook captive breeding, which is how most Americans end up living with exotic pets and which can expose animals to genetic problems. A federal bill that would ban private ownership and cub petting has, despite Baskin's political advocacy, been stalled for the past three years. Only in the United States, right? The series is a reminder of the way Americans' absolutist view of personal liberty can become problematic. ""When I woke up this morning I was in a free f***ing country,"" says Jeff Lowe, a big cat fan whose flashy, playboy lifestyle attracts Joe.  ""And I'm still there.""   Many of these characters believe that nobody, least of all the government, can stop you from pursuing even the most evidently destructive of business practices. In one scene, Joe Exotic — who once ran for president because he thought it would be good for business — tells a TV interviewer that not only will he continue to operate his zoo after an employee loses an arm to a tiger but that if the authorities tried to take his animals away there would be ""a small Waco"". Meanwhile, one of Doc Antle's employees describes, with a resigned smile, working ""8am to midnight"" every day. In a country with little social safety net and a federal minimum wage of $US7.25 ($11.76) an hour, where success and failure are individualised, this is not surprising. At Joe's zoo, his workers raid the meat truck, which delivers discarded supermarket supplies that will be used to feed the tigers. The stuff that isn't passed its use-by date is fair game.   All this is reminiscent of another recent Netflix docuseries, Cheer. That series, about the hectic world of collegiate cheerleading, turned its central character, Navarro College cheer coach Monica Aldama, into a folk hero.  But what it also did was show a kind of capitalism in micro: disenfranchised young people enduring back-breaking misery in the service of a victory they are told is theirs but that really rewards the people above them. So ... where does this all leave us? Carole Baskin had a fairly strong reaction to the docuseries. In a lengthy blog post, she outlined what she said were a series of lies and inaccuracies about her sanctuary, Big Cat Rescue, and the way it treats its animals, employees and volunteers. She also said the show ""had the sole goal of being as salacious and sensational as possible to draw viewers"". ""As part of that, it has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don in 1997.

But phone lines that were cut as the storm made its way through on Monday and Tuesday are still down, making it difficult to ascertain the extent of the destruction. Initial aerial surveillance flights over the worst-affected islands on Tuesday afternoon have shown countless houses and other buildings like churches that have lost roofs, while coconut trees have been downed and food crops flattened.   The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP. Lisa Faerua, the country director for the NGO Oxfam, told the ABC's Pacific Beat she expected the recovery would take more than a year. Ms Faerua said she expected it would be made worse by the economic damage the small Pacific island was set to face because of the coronavirus pandemic.   Vanuatu has already closed its international borders, shutting out valuable tourists and cruise ships, with estimates as many as 40 per cent of people would lose their jobs in the tourism sector as a result. ""It will take time. Recovery will take probably up to six to 12 months,"" Ms Faerua said. ""But what is emerging at the moment for the needs of the people of Vanuatu, it's the economic livelihoods. Given lots of vegetable and food gardens have been damaged during TC Harold."" ""And also people have lost jobs because of COVID-19,"" she added. In neighbouring Fiji, there are already reports of damage, as the now-category four storm tracks towards it close to large-population areas. Thousands of people are sheltering at home or in evacuation centres as winds of 175 kilometres per hour wreak havoc. There are reports of roofs being blown off buildings, roads blocked by fallen trees and swollen waterways. There are also reports of flash flooding in low-lying areas — all this while the country tries to contain its outbreak of coronavirus. With 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country, two cities — including the capital Suva — were in lockdown.   Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said special COVID-19 measures were in place for evacuees.   ""We have contingency plans in place to prevent any mixing between evacuees and Fijians who are close contacts of existing COVID-positive patients,"" Mr Bainimarama said. ""So you should have no hesitation in evacuating as normal if flooding poses a risk. ""All evacuation centres will also be sanitised, and regularly monitored to ensure that they are not filled beyond capacity."" The director of Fiji's National Disaster Management Office Vasiti Soko ordered everyone except emergency services to stay off the roads on Fiji's main island Viti Levu. ""This is to avoid casualty,"" she said. Hundreds of people are sheltering in evacuation centres around the island. Ms Soko said physical distancing would be enforced in evacuation centres. ""We are working closely with the Ministry of Health as well as our first responders in making sure that physical distancing is still being practised in evacuation centres,"" she said.",Pacific Beat,"April 08, 2020"
30,/news/2020-04-08/india-plans-to-convert-trains-into-hospitals-amid-coronavirus/12126104?section=world,India is converting trains into hospital wards as it prepares for worsening coronavirus COVID-19 scenarios,"Empty sport stadiums and train carriages in India are being converted into quarantine centres and makeshift hospitals, as the country prepares for the possibility of hundreds of thousands of people becoming infected with coronavirus. So far, India — which has recorded more than 4,700 cases — has used aggressive quarantine measures to try to contain the outbreak, including a three-week nationwide lockdown and ""containment zones"" to isolate local infection clusters. But with India now into the third and final week of a national lockdown, experts warn the nation is entering a crucial phase. ""The virus is certainly gaining ground,"" global health researcher Dr Anant Bhan said. ""We are past two weeks since any flights have brought in international travellers. So, any infection happening now is happening via local spread.""   Dr Bhan said it looked like community spread was happening because ""there have been enough cases where there is no way to trace it back to an infected individual"". ""The other issue is, we now have cases all across the country,"" he added. One factor that has contributed to case numbers across India was an Islamic gathering in Delhi, which attracted at least 9,000 locals and foreigners before attendees travelled to other parts of the country.     Up to 5,000 train sleeper carriages — which could accommodate up to 80,000 beds — are being converted into isolation wards under plans to prevent India's weak healthcare system from being overwhelmed. As many as 20,000 carriages could be converted if necessary, the Government has said.   Pakistan, which has more than 3,200 confirmed cases, is also converting sleeper trains into makeshift medical wards. Hotels, hostels and sports stadiums will be converted into hospitals to treat people with mild symptoms if a ""large"" outbreak occurs, according to an Indian Ministry of Health strategy released on the weekend.   An isolation and treatment centre is already being established at a stadium in Hyderabad, while a sports complex in Chandigarh — in India's north — is being used as a temporary jail to detain those defying the lockdown. ""I think they are concerned, looking at the scenarios in Italy and Iran, where they have been overwhelmed,"" Dr Bhan said. ""It's good to be prepared. [But] we have a shortage of intensive care health workers who can run ICUs and health ventilators. ""If some of these experts get sick, who will manage these facilities? If we go to worst-case scenario, who will manage these facilities?""     Efforts to clamp down on mass gatherings were thwarted in Delhi last month, when thousands of supporters and preachers of Tablighi Jamaat — a Sunni Islamic movement — held a congregation in the city centre.   A COVID-19 outbreak at the gathering has now been linked to more than 1,400 confirmed infections across India, representing about one third of the country's case load.   Confirmed infections linked to the event span 17 states and territories, resulting in more than 25,000 people in quarantine. More than five villages have also been ""sealed"", organisers have been charged and hundreds of foreign worshippers who attended the event blacklisted. According to the Indian Government, the ramifications of the congregation have been so profound that the rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases is now 4.1 days instead of the 7.4 days authorities had anticipated had the Tablighi Jamaat event not taken place. ""It shows poor foresight of that congregation and local authorities who should have seen a large congregation happening and stopped it from happening,"" Dr Bhan said. ""It was [allowed to] go on for too long.""   In addition to India's national lockdown, neighbourhoods where outbreaks have occurred have been placed into containment zones, which prevent the public from entering or leaving. In Mumbai, parts of Asia's largest slum, Dharavi, have been sealed off. So too has a hospital where more than 40 nurses and three doctors have tested positive for COVID-19. About 300 staff cannot leave Wockhardt hospital until they get two negative test results. Despite this, the Indian Government has remained adamant the national lockdown will end on April 14, although some states have already flagged restrictions will continue afterwards. India has less than one hospital bed per 1,000 people, according to the World Bank. In comparison, the US has 2.9 beds per 1,000 people, Italy has 3.4 beds, and Australia 3.8.

The monster cyclone is now moving away from Vanuatu after battering several islands with winds of more than 200 kilometres an hour, and is continuing its path to neighbouring Fiji. The extent of the damage in Vanuatu remains unclear because the storm brought down phone networks.  But disaster officials on the ground yesterday reported that houses and food crops had been destroyed and heavy rains were causing flooding. Darryn Keneally, the Australian-based director of Coconut Oil Production Santo on Santo Island in Vanuatu, said his local manager told him this morning the island's capital Luganville had been devastated. ""Fifty per cent of homes are damaged,"" Mr Keneally said. ""At this point there seems to be no lives lost, but communication is down so it's very hard to get an accurate picture."" Mr Kenneally said the company's factory had also been badly damaged. ""We, more importantly, are concerned for the people's wellbeing and livelihoods,"" he said. ""We're grateful to hear that at this point no lives are lost, but that could change."" Alice Natu, senior disaster risk reduction officer at Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), said an emergency operations centre had opened last night. She said a surveillance flight was scheduled to leave at 12:00pm (local time) and assessment teams were to make their way to islands up north.   Olivia Finau from the Vanuatu Red Cross Society said they were preparing for bad news when communication lines were restored. She told Pacific Beat their officials on the island of Santo yesterday told them there had been ""a lot of flooding in four residential areas, very strong winds, rain, garden damage and some of the houses were flown away"". ""It is a big worry, because it is a category five. We are expecting a lot of damage to some parts of the islands up north,"" Ms Finau said. The director of NaDraki weather service, Neville Koop, said the cyclone was expected to remain a powerful storm for several days. ""After sunrise, we will start to see the true magnitude of the impacts there [in Vanuatu],"" he told Pacific Beat. ""We now have Fiji in its path, and after that, Tonga. While we don't expect the cyclone to make landfall in either of those island nations, it will be very close to them and enough so, we do expect more damage and possible physical harms,"" he warned. The director of Vanuatu's disaster office is already looking to the recovery efforts.   NDMO head Abraham Nasak posted a video to social media yesterday, in which he said they would further ease travel restrictions that had been introduced as part of the country's COVID-19 state of emergency. Mr Nasak said because there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19, they would be able to lift the ban on domestic travel, so relief goods could be sent to the worst-affected areas. But he said they would not be compromising and opening up their international border to people, even humanitarian officials, from countries with COVID-19 community transmission. That would include Australia and New Zealand. ""We will allow cargo, such as relief goods that we request,"" he said. But Mr Nasak was very clear that those goods would need to have been requested by Vanuatu, saying they did not want ""unsolicited bilateral donations"".",Pacific Beat,"April 07, 2020"
32,/news/2020-04-07/comparing-australia-with-singapore-coronavirus/12107106?section=world,Singapore is often praised for its coronavirus response. How does it compare to Australia's?,"As the world grapples with COVID-19, Singapore has been praised for its ability to keep a lid on new coronavirus infections without imposing major social and economic restrictions. But with its government now ""very concerned"" by a rise in locally transmitted cases, Singapore has ratcheted up its response.   On April 3 it announced strict new measures to curb further spread. They include shutting non-essential businesses and schools. On some fronts, Singapore took earlier, tougher action than Australia. But now on issues such as outdoor exercise, it is catching up.  So, what has been Singapore's approach to date, and what's changed? RMIT ABC Fact Check examines the key areas of its response.   Singapore had introduced a range of measures into schools before deciding to close them from April 8. On March 19, for example, the government announced ""wipe-down routines"" would be introduced to classes, kids would be assigned seats in the canteen and groups split up in the playground following term break (March 14 to March 23).   Recess times were already being staggered and group activities such as assemblies cancelled, and now any non-classroom activities would also cease. Schools had also been conducting daily temperature checks of students. The decision to close was announced just a week after the government said on March 27 that schools would start transitioning to one day per week of study from home from April 1. Now, all primary and secondary students will move to full ""home-based learning"" and all preschools and kindergartens will ""suspend their general services"". The Ministry of Education said parents ""working in essential services such as healthcare, who are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, may approach their children's primary schools and preschools for assistance"".  Before the closure, Australian political leaders including Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan had pointed to Singapore as a model for Australia's schools policy.     Singapore began temperature screening all plane arrivals from the Chinese city of Wuhan on January 3 and by later that month pre-schools were checking temperatures for all children, staff and visitors. The country reported its first case on January 23, two days before Australia. By January 29, Singapore was temperature screening anyone arriving by land, air or sea and by early February, company employees and even taxi drivers were being screened.   As of February 3, Singapore had conducted more than 300 laboratory tests, with 240 people cleared, 43 ""suspect cases"" waiting on results and 18 cases confirmed. On March 25 the Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said it had a test rate of 6,800 per million people.   At that time Australia had conducted almost 163,000 tests for a population of 25.6 million, a rate of just under 6,400 per million people. Australia has since surpassed Singapore's test rate, which on April 5 stood at 7,000 tests per million people, according to local news reports. By March 31, Australia had conducted 209,000 tests, a rate of nearly 8,200 per million people. Singapore began isolating people from January 20. At first this applied only to those with symptoms travelling from Wuhan and by January 22 to anyone with symptoms travelling from China.  Between February 2 and March 16, it progressively barred visitors from specific countries (China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, Germany) and denied entry to cruise ships. On March 24, it shut the door to all visitors, four days after Australia did the same. Locals returning home or foreigners who arrived in Singapore before the bans took effect were initially required to avoid work for 14 days but allowed to leave the house to buy essentials. From February 19, however, the government began issuing stricter ""stay-home notices"". These notices allowed family visitors but forced people to ""remain in their place of residence at all times"", and were soon issued to anyone coming from Italy, Iran or South Korea. By March 21, they were served to anyone returning from abroad.   Locals returning from some countries were subsequently required to serve out their ""stay-home notice"" at a dedicated facility, such as a hotel, rather than in their own residence. Australia introduced self-isolation for all returning travellers on March 16.   Meanwhile, travellers to Singapore from China's Hubei province, along with confirmed cases or their close contacts, were put into full quarantine. That meant no physical interaction with anyone. If that wasn't possible at home, they were sent to a government facility for two weeks. Unlike Australia, Singapore put people with mild symptoms in hospital rather than sending them home to self-isolate. Writing for The Conversation, National University of Singapore's Professor Dale Fisher said that Australia, Europe and the US were sending home ""mild cases"". ""In Singapore, we think it's better to hive those people off and look after them elsewhere until the virus is clear."" On April 5, Singapore's health ministry said it had quarantined a total 17,345 people who had been in close contact with a confirmed case. After the government became more concerned about local transmission, it declared two sites housing almost 20,000 foreign workers to be ""isolation areas"", preventing residents from going to work and restricting recreational activity. The Singapore government has deported and permanently banned foreign workers caught flouting isolation rules and punished their employers. At least one person who breached their stay-home notice has been stripped of their permanent residency. Stay-home notices (for travellers with no symptoms and no suspected contact with confirmed cases) and quarantine orders (for travellers from China's Hubei province or confirmed cases and their close contacts), both have legal force, with breaches attracting fines as high as $10,000 SGD (roughly $11,000 AUD) or up to six months in jail.   Those who don't comply with the stricter quarantine order can also be forced to wear an electronic tag. Lawrence Wong, the head of Singapore's cross-government coronavirus taskforce, has said the government ""will use a whole range of methods to enforce and make sure that there is compliance with the regime."" ""We can do so through video calls, through their phones, identifying where their locations are, through spot checks,"" he said. In Australia, states began introducing legal sanctions for breaching isolation rules on March 16. Singapore has been noted for its ability to quickly track down people who have been in contact, wittingly or not, with someone who has COVID-19. Evaluating Singapore's early response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published research showing contact tracing had identified 53 of the country's first 100 cases, of whom roughly a quarter were caught before showing symptoms. According to local news reports, every day between 30 and 50 Singapore police assist health officials in piecing together timelines and transmission networks by trawling data, scanning CCTV footage and conducting interviews. Those numbers can be quickly doubled if needed, and police are assisted by Singapore's embrace of technology.   On March 20, the government launched an app that records whenever users come near each other. This phone data can be shared if a user develops COVID-19. (The Singapore government says the app requires user consent.) Businesses serving food and drinks have also been encouraged to log customer details using a government registration system. Singapore's government has released potentially identifying personal information alongside each confirmed case, making it possible for others to map the spread of the coronavirus in detail. Australia has been more cautious about releasing personal information, with the expert health advisory panel arguing it may erode public cooperation. Still, there are examples of using technology to track cases. In February, the ABC reported South Australia Police had tracked an infected couple through Adelaide using their phone data for the state's health department. Australia's contact tracing efforts have ramped up since the outbreak of coronavirus, with Victoria boosting its contact tracing personnel from 57 to 230, for example, and the Australian Defence Force starting to assist the states. In January, Singapore established a whole-of-government coronavirus taskforce and on February 16 launched a campaign to raise awareness of good public hygiene. By comparison, Australia launched a public awareness campaign on March 14.  With Singapore's doctors already being asked to write 5-day medical certificates for anyone with respiratory symptoms, on February 18 the government began activating 900 ""public health preparedness clinics"", designed to provide subsidised treatments during outbreaks. More recently, the government has significantly increased its social distancing restrictions. From March 13, gatherings larger than 250 people were ""advised"" to cancel or take precautionary steps. By March 20, they were banned, and anything smaller required at least one metre between people. From March 27, groups larger than 10 were banned and the government closed all bars and entertainment venues like night clubs, cinemas, theatres and karaoke outlets, ""where there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time"".   However, other public venues ""such as retail malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient"" could remain open. On April 3, the government announced that, starting April 7, food and beverage outlets would be restricted to takeaway and delivery only. All attractions, sports and recreation facilities would close, along with churches and non-essential businesses. Sport Singapore, a government agency, said on April 5: ""If you wish to exercise outdoors, exercise on your own or only with members of your own household around your immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places."" Additionally, the government said, ""The general public is advised to stay home and avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in the same household.""  Australia banned outdoor gatherings of 500 people on March 18, began shutting down pubs, gyms and cinemas and restricting restaurants and cafes on March 23, and limited both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two persons only on March 31.     Academics at the University of Oxford have attempted to quantify and compare the steps taken by governments around the world to control the spread of COVID-19.  They have created a composite index tracking the stringency of government responses.  The index tracks seven policy measures — closures of schools, workplaces or public transport, cancellations of events, restrictions on travel or internal movement, and public messaging — and four financial indicators, covering fiscal and monetary measures and public spending on emergency healthcare and vaccines. The authors say: ""Where data for one of the seven indicators are missing, they contribute ""0"" to the index ... Our conservative approach therefore ""punishes"" countries for which less information is available, but also avoids the risk of over-generalizing from limited information."" On the day Singapore recorded its first case, it had a stringency score of 29 out of 100 and Australia scored 7. For most of February, Singapore's score was 33 while Australia's rose to 29. By March 15, the most recent data available for Singapore, it scored 38 while Australia remained on 29. Australia's strongest measures have been introduced since that date, and accordingly its score has risen progressively to 71 on April 2. No comparable figures are yet available for Singapore. Before the outbreak, the 2019 Global Health Security Index — produced by the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, among others — ranked Singapore 11th in the world for countries most prepared to respond to an epidemic, and Australia 10th.

33,/news/2020-04-06/solomon-islands-women-girls-challenge-sexual-violence-inequality/12006340?section=world,Solomon Islands is no paradise for women. These people are leading the charge for change,"Solomon Islands is an intensely beautiful place made up of hundreds of lush islands scattered across the blue and green waters of the South Pacific. But life on Australia's near neighbour isn't as simple or as peaceful as this may sound. A civil war that devastated the country has now ended, but the new government fails to provide essentials for everyday life. Many people lack running water, basic health care and nutritious food. Climate change is a real threat.   Solomon Islands also has one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence in the world. Two-thirds of women aged 15 to 49 have reported physical or sexual abuse by a partner. Three-quarters of both men and women believe this violence is acceptable, especially if a woman is ""disobedient"". But many extraordinary people I encounter during a visit to the Solomons are trying valiantly to change this.   A long and bumpy road that runs the length of Honiara, the ramshackle capital of Solomon Islands, takes me towards a home where I will meet two young activists. My taxi driver Homer used to be a high school history teacher, and says even in school, boys don't treat girls with respect. ""They beat them up. They make fun of them and shout when they talk. They steal their pencils. They show no respect for girls,"" he says. The girls I am about to visit, Elima and Elizabeth, graduated from high school last year, and are still working for girls' right to an education. A big barrier is school fees. Parents are usually only willing to pay for boys to attend upper high school, as girls are expected to get married and become part of their in-laws' family.   Even if a girl is lucky enough to stay in school, traditional cultural attitudes usually mean long hours of household chores for her before and after school each day. ""The boys, they are like a king, while the girls will work all the hours in the day,"" Elima says. ""They're doing the laundry by hand and hauling water, collecting wood for the fire, minding younger children. The boys are saying, 'Do this' and 'Do that!'"" Both girls laugh as they talk, but the problem is serious. Only 20 per cent of girls complete Year 10 and fewer still finish Year 12. Elima and Elizabeth were part of a group, supported by Plan International Australia, who researched and wrote a report that was given to Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he visited the Solomons. It asked for Australian aid for education to be tied to gender equity. I'm told the response from Australia was polite but insubstantial.   Solomon Islands is still a largely subsistence society based on fish, taro and coconuts. But that way of living is becoming increasingly precarious, and more and more people go to Honiara, hoping for a job. Few find one, and rates of unemployment in the capital are staggering. So is the drunkenness and domestic violence.   ""In the past, in our culture, men made all the decisions and their word was final,"" Homer tells me as we leave Elima's house. ""But while men always stood at the front and had the dominant role, they treated women and girls with respect. ""How do we teach boys and men to show that respect again?"" Back in 1998 ethnic tensions on the main island of Guadalcanal escalated into violence. The RAMSI mission, a multi-national intervention led by Australia, ended the violence in 2003 and remained in the Solomons until 2017. The Australian government spent $2.5 billion along the way, and the Australian Federal Police are still there. According to some of the people I've encountered, by the time RAMSI ended, the Solomons was a different country.   Children had spent years out of school, families had been dislocated and traditional cultural behaviour was destabilised. Lavinia Takei is the Safe Families project manager for Oxfam in the country. She travels to remote communities across the hundreds of scattered islands, working on transforming harmful gender attitudes in the Solomons. She is not always welcomed, especially by the men. Some community leaders are completely opposed to NGOs like Oxfam bringing what they see as Western messages and training.   And they're not the only ones. Lavinia tells me her own family and friends also think the man's place is as the unquestioned head of the family and that she's wrong to ever challenge this. ""I get that all the time! Especially from my husband, my brothers and from my friends! My female friends, surprisingly,"" she says. ""I try to be open minded about their perspectives and change things little by little."" She has some success. One male leader who opposed the workshops became a convert, declaring that her message was about protecting women from violence, not undermining men or traditional values. She sometimes sees less success in Honiara, where the ""trauma of hearing gunshots in the night"" lingers. ""During the violence I went to the market early one morning and there was a group of people with a bag in front of them,"" she recalls. She hesitates — the memory obviously still raw. ""In it was a head — a headless person. It was just his head."" She says many people resort to alcohol to cope. ""Women and men are not valuing their traditions. They'd rather go drinking than come together as a community and talk a problem through,"" she says. Further down the narrow road that runs through Honiara, I meet another woman determined to make a change in her community. Loretta Taika is dressed in shorts, sandals and a high-vis vest. She has a shovel in her hand.   Around her a group of people work hard to clean the rubbish off a dirt track running down a steep hill into the main road. The track turns into a river of filth when the rain pours down each afternoon. Loretta lives in a settler community — a shanty town made up of people who've come in from other islands looking for work and built homes out of scrap on unoccupied land around the city. They have no running water, no electricity and no garbage collection. That's the problem that Loretta's tackling this month: cleaning the road and trying to organise council garbage collection.   She approached aid organisations for the loan of shovels, rakes, machetes and wheelbarrows and mobilised her neighbours to begin cleaning. The main problem was providing the bins. Settlers can't afford to buy them from the council. Loretta has come up with an alternative, now she's waiting to see if the council will empty the bins she's organised or leave the rubbish for the dogs to scatter. When I ask why she does this community work, she becomes quiet. ""Five years ago my sister was murdered,"" she says. It left her full of hate and sorrow. ""And that makes me strong to build up to address problems in communities. ""The only thing that I can do now is I might save someone's life — by giving out awareness to the young ones to see the importance of women, to see the importance of their mother, of their sister, so that they start caring about them.""   Working with her brother and her cousin Lester, a well-known local rapper known as Bibao, she goes into communities and runs workshops. ""It's what my sister loved to do — art and design. Through that art we teach each other life skills. I try to make them realise what their skills are and that they're important,"" she says. Through tears, she tells me that her sister would be proud of what she is doing. ""We are fighting just to make things right. It's so hard. But I just have to live with it because I think this is what I have to do. To make me happy. To save someone's life,"" she says. As I leave Loretta to her work, I come across a long fence covered in vivid graffiti. It says in huge letters: ""EQUAL"". In smaller letters, scattered amid hearts and fruit and random designs it says, ""Hear Her Too"", ""Eliminate Gender Based Violence"", ""Healthy Relationships"" and ""I Choose to Support Him/Her"". It was created by Loretta and her crew, and it's beautiful.   I flag down a local bus and ride back to Chester's Resthouse, a hostel run by the Melanesian Brotherhood. As I'm looking out over the scrappy port of Honiara, Brother George comes to warn me not to walk down to the main street after dark. We chat for a while. He tells me how much he loves his home island of Isabel despite the lack of sanitation, running water and electricity.   The government could help, he says, but he's not confident that it will. Instead he prays. ""I pray that Solomon Islands will be a peaceful country,"" he says. Many of the women I meet in the Solomons are working towards that end.

34,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
35,/news/2020-04-09/road-bridge-in-north-italy-collapses-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/12135660,Coronavirus lockdown limits casualties as road bridge in north Italy collapses,"A bridge on a normally busy provincial road in northern Italy has collapsed, but, with virtually no traffic due to the coronavirus lockdown, only two truck drivers suffered minor injuries.   The local fire brigade said the 260-metre bridge on the SS330 road near the town of Aulla, roughly midway between Genoa and Florence, collapsed on Wednesday morning. Although casualties were limited, the collapse highlighted the poor state of Italy's road network. In 2018 a motorway bridge in the port city of Genoa collapsed, killing 43 people. Sections of the bridge across the river Magra collapsed to the level of the water, buckling a stretch of road behind it. The lockdown to halt the spread of the coronavirus meant the heavy midweek traffic that might normally have been using the bridge was absent, and only two vehicles were involved. The two drivers were taken to hospital with minor injuries, a fire brigade spokesman said.   A fire brigade team helped by dogs inspected the debris of the concrete bridge, dating back to 1908 and rebuilt after World War II, but did not find any other vehicles. The bridge used to be managed by provincial authorities before being put under the management of ANAS, a company controlled by state-owned railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, in 2018. It had undergone periodic safety checks since last year, ANAS said in a statement. ANAS said it was investigating the causes of the collapse. The poor maintenance of Italy's roads and bridges, and mismanagement of its highway network, has been a major political issue since the collapse of the bridge in Genoa. The road involved in Wednesday's incident had been repaired after bad weather in November. Reuters",,"April 09, 2020"
36,/news/2020-04-09/when-does-joe-biden-take-on-trump-questions-answered/12063320,Why did Bernie Sanders drop out? When will Joe Biden face Donald Trump? Five questions answered now the Democratic nominee is decided,"Bernie Sanders, the US Vermont Senator, has ended his campaign to become the next US President. That means Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee and Donald Trump's opponent in the 2020 election. The former vice president beat out 28 other Democratic hopefuls. Here's some really simple answers to your questions about what happens now. Yes. Bernie Sanders was the only other serious contender in the race, and he has now officially dropped out. There are still several primaries and caucuses to run, but without another contender in the race Joe Biden will be a runaway victor in most of them. It's also unclear at this point if they will proceed as Americans deal with the coronavirus outbreak. From here on out, it's Biden V Trump. Get caught up: We've just watched a gruelling season of primaries and caucuses. Here's how America's election system works.   Americans will cast their vote for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump on November 4, AEDT. That's about seven months from now. You won't have to wait that long though to see them face off though. The pair will clash in the first presidential debate on September 30 AEDT. Two more debates will take place in late October. Mark your calendar: Here's a super simple guide to all the key dates left in the 2020 US election. We don't know yet. A candidate normally chooses their running mate closer to the convention (more on this shortly). But at the latest debate Joe Biden committed to naming a woman as his VP pick.   Mr Biden suggested Stacey Abrams (who ran for governor of Georgia in 2018), former deputy attorney-general Sally Yates and Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen (senators from New Hampshire) were the kinds of people he was looking for, but didn't say which candidates he'd been looking for.   In previous comments, he said he was looking for a VP with experience on the presidential stage, which means his opponents from earlier in the year, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, could also get the nod. Could it really be a failed primary candidate?: It wouldn't be the first time a former opponent got the running mate job. We profiled every Democrat who entered the race right here. Bernie Sanders will continue his work as a US senator and politician.  He cited congress's work on the country's coronavirus response as one reason that continuing to campaign was unfeasible.   ""This is something I intend to be intensely involved with over the next couple of months and it's something that takes an enormous amount of work,"" he said. Sanders also made clear that he'd continue fighting for the policy plans at the heart of his campaign, including universal healthcare, income equality and a green new deal to fight climate change.  Though he said he fully supports Joe Biden as the nominee, Mr Sanders plans to remain on the ballot in the remaining (delayed) primaries to maintain a level of influence over the Democratic party platform.  ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. They're now widely supported,"" he said.  How did Bernie Sanders lose this race? His early lead took a huge hit on Super Tuesday. Here's why the moderates started rallying against him.    The simple answer is we don't know a lot of things, yet. Things are in such a state of flux in the US right now that it's difficult to predict what will happen in a week, let alone several months away.   We know that the Democratic convention has been moved to August 17, just a week before the Republican convention. We don't know how the conventions might have to change if the US is still in the grip of the pandemic. We also know that the election must happen before January 21, 2021. So one way or another, Americans will be heading to the polls to vote for Biden or Trump sometime in the near future. Can Trump cancel the election?: No, his presidential power has limits. If you want to find out how the November poll is likely to change, you can dive in right here. ",By Peter Marsh and Emily Olson,"April 09, 2020"
37,/news/2020-04-09/bernie-sanders-suspends-presidential-campaign/12135328,"Bernie Sanders exits US presidential race, paving way for Joe Biden to be Democratic nominee","Bernie Sanders has exited the race to become the next president of the United States, paving the way for former vice-president Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee and face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 3 election.   The 78-year-old US senator from Vermont, a democratic socialist whose progressive agenda pulled the party sharply to the left, shot to an early lead in the Democratic race but faded quickly after losing South Carolina in late February as moderate Democrats consolidated their support behind Biden. Senator Sanders said his decision to end his campaign was not an easy one.  ""Please know that I do not make this decision lightly,"" he said in a livestreamed speech to supporters. ""If I believe we had a feasible path to the nomination I would continue, but I know that it's just not there.""  ""I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful. And so today, I am announcing the suspension of my campaign.""   The departure of Senator Sanders, the last remaining rival to Mr Biden, sets up a race between the 77-year-old former vice-president and Mr Trump, 73, who is seeking a second four-year term in office.   Though Senator Sanders said he fully supported Mr Biden as the nominee, he added he would remain on the ballots in remaining primaries and collect electoral delegates to influence the party platform at the nominating convention.  ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. They're now widely supported,"" he said, describing the touchstones of his political ideology, such as universal healthcare and redistributing income.  ""My run for president has never been about me. As a president, I believed I could accelerate and institutionalise these ideas."" Mr Biden swiftly issued a statement saying he wanted to work with Senator Sanders.  ""Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn't just run a political campaign; he's created a movement,"" the statement read. ""And make no mistake about it, I believe it's a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That's a good thing for our nation and our future."" Mr Biden had a 300-delegate lead over Senator Sanders, leaving him just 700 shy of the 1,991 total needed to clinch the nomination.  Though most of the remaining primaries had been postponed due to coronavirus, Mr Biden was expected to win them.  Mr Biden, who beat out 28 other candidates, will be officially named the nominee at the Democratic Nominating Convention, which has been postponed to August 17. While Mr Biden responded, so did Mr Trump. He implored disillusioned Democrats to support him, taking a shot at the Democratic Party on Twitter. ""This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!,"" Mr Trump wrote.   Many of Senator Sanders' policy positions have become part of the mainstream Democratic Party debate, including his Medicare for All proposal that would create a government-run healthcare system to replace the current blend of private medical insurance and public programs.  He also advocated a $US15 minimum wage, tuition-free public colleges and higher taxes on the wealthy. ABC/Reuters",By Emily Olson and staff,"April 09, 2020"
38,/news/2020-04-09/truck-driver-pleads-guilty-to-39-counts-of-manslaughter/12135288,Northern Irish truck driver pleads guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter after immigrants die in trailer,"A truck driver has pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter related to the deaths of Vietnamese people found in a shipping container in southeast England last year.   Maurice Robinson, a 25-year-old from Craigavon in Northern Ireland, entered the plea at Central London Criminal Court where he appeared via video link alongside four co-defendants. The bodies of the 31 men and 8 women were discovered in a refrigerated trailer in the town of Grays, east of London, shortly after arriving on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Police investigating the case found the victims were all from Vietnam and ranged in age from 15 to 44 and are believed to have paid people traffickers to smuggle them into England. Most of the victims were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward fuel migration.   Autopsies concluded that the likely cause of death of the 39 Vietnamese people was a combination of oxygen deprivation and hyperthermia in an enclosed space. Among the dead were 10 teenagers. Of the other defendants Gheorghe Nica, 43, denied 39 counts of manslaughter.  Romanian national Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 27, denied a charge of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.  Christopher Kennedy, 23, of County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has previously denied conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, was not asked to enter a plea to the charge of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration.  Mr Robinson also admitted to one charge of transferring criminal property, but denied a charge of transferring criminal property. ABC/Reuters",,"April 09, 2020"
39,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-roger-federer-gives-tennis-lesson-on-social-media/12133464,Roger Federer gives social media tennis lesson while self-isolating during coronavirus pandemic,"Roger Federer has a bit of spare time on his hands at the moment, with professional tennis on hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic.   But that has not stopped the 20-time major singles champion from keeping himself busy by offering tips to his legion of fans around the world, who are also stuck at home because of self-isolation and social distancing measures. Federer took to Twitter and Instagram with a short video to showcase what he described as a ""helpful solo drill"" for all the tennis enthusiasts looking to improve their volleying skills while confined to their dwellings. He tapped the ball more than 200 times during the test of reflex and form in the 59-second video.   Federer did not stop there, however, going one step further by encouraging his followers and other social media users to reply to him with their own videos mimicking the volleying exercise he displayed so he could give some feedback.   There was some extra advice as well, with the Panama-hat wearing Federer directing users to ""choose your hat wisely"".   Within six hours, Federer's video garnered more than 1 million views, and his post drew more than 1,300 replies. Many of those replying to Federer got inventive, with two sisters teaming up to mimic a typical on-court exchange between a player and a ball kid.   ""Classic, you guys are funny,"" Federer replied. Federer also apologised to the father of one of his fans, who had interrupted a Zoom meeting by volleying against a wall at home while wearing a sombrero.   ""That was the right choice of hat, love the effort, sorry to your dad!"" wrote Federer alongside a series of smiling and laughing emojis. To another tweet, in which a man hit a tennis ball against an indoor wall while a dog appeared to nap underneath, Federer answered: ""Love the confidence not to drop the [tennis ball emoji] on the [dog emoji].""   Federer replied to a number of other tweets, often complimenting their choice of headwear and dispensing a little advice.   ""Don't lean back, strong in the wrist,"" Federer wrote to one Twitter user.  ""Keep up the great work."" Federer, who holds the record for most major singles trophies won by a male player, has previously posted clips of himself hitting against a wall in the snow, including around-the-back or through-the-leg ""tweener"" trick shots. The 38-year-old, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in February, is waiting — along with every other professional player — for competitive tennis to return. The men's and women's professional tours are suspended until at least mid-July because of the COVID-19 pandemic.       ABC/AP",,"April 08, 2020"
40,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-mail-in-ballots-could-give-trump-election-advantage/12132302,Coronavirus couldn't force Republicans to delay the Wisconsin primary. That's good news for Donald Trump.,"Two-hour queues. Closed polling locations. Confusion, frustration and fear of catching a virus that's claimed 12,000 lives in the US already. That's what thousands of voters in Wisconsin faced on Wednesday as they participated in a primary election that ploughed ahead after a zig-zagging display of partisanship and power. The state showed us what happens when voting marches forward in the midst of a pandemic. But there's just as much to be learned from the path that Wisconsin's politicians took to deciding the election should proceed unchanged.   It's the same path that the US Federal Government has started walking down. Just three weeks ago, the quiet midwestern state had only reported 400 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Wisconsin's Democratic Governor and Republican Congress were in agreement that the election, which entailed both local contests and the democratic presidential primary, should proceed.   Wisconsin, one of the great ""bellwether states"", has a long record of voting for the eventual White House winner, regardless of his political party. But when it came to the Democratic primary, the state was expected to further solidify Joe Biden's lead over Bernie Sanders.   Though the results of Wednesday's contest won't be released until April 13, Biden leads Sanders by 28 points in the latest polls. State officials were more concerned with carrying out the general election. The thinking was that new judges, sheriffs and mayors — whose new terms begin next week — might be critical to helping fight the virus. But then other states started delaying their contests (now up to 16 in total), and the number of cases in Wisconsin rose to 2,500. Experts forecasted the virus would rapidly spread during the first two weeks of April. Wisconsin municipalities, realizing that 60 per cent of polling stations would be understaffed as older volunteers stayed home, called for the election to be cancelled or postponed. Four days before the election, the Governor heeded those calls. He convened a special session of the only group with the power to actually change the election — the state congress — and asked them to consider shifting the entire election to vote by mail.   Wisconsin's Republican leaders ended the special session in less than 60 seconds. They said that the change would be ""logistically impossible"" on such short notice and added that relaxing the state's strict voter-ID laws around mail-in ballots would lead only to fraud. The Republican-controlled state Supreme Court ruled that the Democratic governor lacked the power to implement any changes unilaterally. The Republican-leaning federal Supreme Court concurred on one part, saying that the governor couldn't extend the deadline to register for a mail-in ballot (though a record 1.2 million Wisconsinites managed to register in time). Andrew Hitt, the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, cheered the moves. He told the Atlantic that ""making such a dramatic change in how we do elections in a crisis is probably not good public policy."" ""That's how you do poor public policy, by doing it in a hurry,"" he said. Federal politicians are hoping to avoid last-minute discussion and decision-making should coronavirus threaten November's Presidential election.   Democrats tried to set aside $US2 billion ($3.2 billion) in the last coronavirus stimulus plans to guarantee universal mail-in voting, but Republicans only agreed to $US400 million for elections None of it was earmarked specifically for mail-in voting.   The Republican opposition to mail-in voting goes all the way to the top of the ticket. President Trump told reporters that ""people cheat with mail-in voting"". ""It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don't send it in the mail where people can pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen … by the time it gets in and is tabulated.""   It's a line he's used since 2016, when he made baseless claims that he lost the popular vote because mail-in ballots were inaccurately counted. Now, his campaign is reportedly working closely with the Republican National Party to launch a multi-million-dollar ad campaign against proposals to change voting in any way. Experts say it's pretty easy to compare ballot signatures to the ones states keep on file, although it can lead to delays in counting.   The five states that hold their elections entirely by mail haven't reported an outsized issue with fraud. But the experience of those states do give merit to another Republican hang-up, which is that voting by mail is by no means logistically simple.  The word from Wisconsin is that many of the 1.2 million voters who requested mail-in ballots didn't receive them in time or properly submit them. For the states with successful mail-in voting measures, it took years and money to hammer out a smooth process. Some of it has to do with equipment and education, but perhaps the biggest part of it has to do with the time it takes to change bureaucracy, which brings us back to the Republican opposition.   There's a long history of Republicans using the line about voter fraud to cover up their real concern: increasing voter turnout.   Research by nonpartisan voting groups show that even the option of vote-by-mail increases turnout by several percentage points, driven by minority groups like Hispanics, who more reliably vote for Democrats. The Republicans in Wisconsin didn't explicitly cite this as a concern, but those in other states did. The House Speaker in Georgia, when deciding the fate of his own state's election, said that absentee ballots would be ""extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia. Every registered voter is going to get one of these. … This will certainly drive up turnout."" The odd irony to all this talk about political parties manipulating the election to maintain power is that in Wisconsin, the result will be contested regardless of how it falls.  No one will have faith in the integrity of the outcome, not to mention the leaders swept into place because of it.  Wednesday's election is the first in a long time to end without a trace of speculation, celebration or excitement about the big winners. All anyone can talk about is the voters.

41,/news/2020-04-08/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-at-73-of-coronavirus-compli/12132638,Grammy-winning songwriter John Prine dies at 73 of coronavirus complications,"Grammy-winning singer John Prine, who wrote his early songs in his head while delivering mail and went on to become one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, has died due to complications from coronavirus.   He was 73. Prine's publicist confirmed the singer-songwriter died due to complications from COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Nashville. Prine was hospitalised on March 26 suffering from symptoms of COVID-19, according to his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, who was also his manager. ""We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,"" the Recording Academy, which gives out the Grammy Awards, said in a written statement. ""Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John's impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.""   Born in Chicago on October 10, 1946, Prine's older brother taught him to play guitar at the age of 14. After graduating from high school in suburban Maywood, Illinois, Prine worked as a mail carrier for five years, performing in Chicago clubs in the evenings at occasional ""open mic"" nights. He would say later that some of his best-known early songs were written while he walked the streets of Chicago delivering mail.   ""I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books,"" he told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview. ""You just had time to be quiet and think, and that's where I would come up with a lot of songs. If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down."" He was drafted into the US Army in 1966, and was stationed in Germany during the Vietnam War, before returning home to dedicate himself to music and establishing himself as a leading member of Chicago's folk revival scene. Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson fatefully saw Prine performing at the Earl of Old Town club, leading to Prine's signing with Atlantic Records and self-titled debut album, released in 1971. That album, widely praised by critics, contained several songs that would become staples of Prine's catalogue.   They included Angel from Montgomery, about a woman wishing for deliverance from her unfulfilling life, Paradise, about a Kentucky town devastated by strip mining, and Sam Stone, chronicling the downward spiral of a drug-addicted Vietnam War veteran and containing the oft-quoted refrain: ""There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes, Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose."" The songs have since been covered dozens of times by other artists. His early songwriting style earned comparisons with folk great Bob Dylan, who later called Prine one of his favourites. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs,"" Dylan told the Huffington Post in 2009. Prine released a string of albums in the 1970s, winning larger audiences and critical acclaim as his music stretched from folk to country to Americana, often infused with a sense of humour. In the 1980s, fed up with the recording industry, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, releasing albums under that imprint for the next several decades.   He won his first Grammy Award in 1991, Best Contemporary Folk Album, for The Missing Years. He would win a second Grammy in the same category in 2005 for Fair and Square. In December 2019, the Recording Academy honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.   Prine survived squamous cell cancer in 1998, undergoing surgery to his neck and tongue that left his voice with an even deeper, gravelly tone. In 2013, he was diagnosed with cancer in his left lung and had it removed. Prine was able to find humour in his struggle with cancer, joking that it actually improved his voice. The same humour suffused much of his work, alongside its poignant commentary about the struggles and foibles of ordinary people. ""If I can make myself laugh about something I should be crying about, that's pretty good,"" he once said. Reuters    ",,"April 08, 2020"
42,/news/2020-04-08/india-plans-to-convert-trains-into-hospitals-amid-coronavirus/12126104,India is converting trains into hospital wards as it prepares for worsening coronavirus COVID-19 scenarios,"Empty sport stadiums and train carriages in India are being converted into quarantine centres and makeshift hospitals, as the country prepares for the possibility of hundreds of thousands of people becoming infected with coronavirus. So far, India — which has recorded more than 4,700 cases — has used aggressive quarantine measures to try to contain the outbreak, including a three-week nationwide lockdown and ""containment zones"" to isolate local infection clusters. But with India now into the third and final week of a national lockdown, experts warn the nation is entering a crucial phase. ""The virus is certainly gaining ground,"" global health researcher Dr Anant Bhan said. ""We are past two weeks since any flights have brought in international travellers. So, any infection happening now is happening via local spread.""   Dr Bhan said it looked like community spread was happening because ""there have been enough cases where there is no way to trace it back to an infected individual"". ""The other issue is, we now have cases all across the country,"" he added. One factor that has contributed to case numbers across India was an Islamic gathering in Delhi, which attracted at least 9,000 locals and foreigners before attendees travelled to other parts of the country.     Up to 5,000 train sleeper carriages — which could accommodate up to 80,000 beds — are being converted into isolation wards under plans to prevent India's weak healthcare system from being overwhelmed. As many as 20,000 carriages could be converted if necessary, the Government has said.   Pakistan, which has more than 3,200 confirmed cases, is also converting sleeper trains into makeshift medical wards. Hotels, hostels and sports stadiums will be converted into hospitals to treat people with mild symptoms if a ""large"" outbreak occurs, according to an Indian Ministry of Health strategy released on the weekend.   An isolation and treatment centre is already being established at a stadium in Hyderabad, while a sports complex in Chandigarh — in India's north — is being used as a temporary jail to detain those defying the lockdown. ""I think they are concerned, looking at the scenarios in Italy and Iran, where they have been overwhelmed,"" Dr Bhan said. ""It's good to be prepared. [But] we have a shortage of intensive care health workers who can run ICUs and health ventilators. ""If some of these experts get sick, who will manage these facilities? If we go to worst-case scenario, who will manage these facilities?""     Efforts to clamp down on mass gatherings were thwarted in Delhi last month, when thousands of supporters and preachers of Tablighi Jamaat — a Sunni Islamic movement — held a congregation in the city centre.   A COVID-19 outbreak at the gathering has now been linked to more than 1,400 confirmed infections across India, representing about one third of the country's case load.   Confirmed infections linked to the event span 17 states and territories, resulting in more than 25,000 people in quarantine. More than five villages have also been ""sealed"", organisers have been charged and hundreds of foreign worshippers who attended the event blacklisted. According to the Indian Government, the ramifications of the congregation have been so profound that the rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases is now 4.1 days instead of the 7.4 days authorities had anticipated had the Tablighi Jamaat event not taken place. ""It shows poor foresight of that congregation and local authorities who should have seen a large congregation happening and stopped it from happening,"" Dr Bhan said. ""It was [allowed to] go on for too long.""   In addition to India's national lockdown, neighbourhoods where outbreaks have occurred have been placed into containment zones, which prevent the public from entering or leaving. In Mumbai, parts of Asia's largest slum, Dharavi, have been sealed off. So too has a hospital where more than 40 nurses and three doctors have tested positive for COVID-19. About 300 staff cannot leave Wockhardt hospital until they get two negative test results. Despite this, the Indian Government has remained adamant the national lockdown will end on April 14, although some states have already flagged restrictions will continue afterwards. India has less than one hospital bed per 1,000 people, according to the World Bank. In comparison, the US has 2.9 beds per 1,000 people, Italy has 3.4 beds, and Australia 3.8.

43,/news/2020-04-08/us-navy-secretary-thomas-modly-resigns-coronavirus-ship/12131594,US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigns over handling of USS Theodore Roosevelt coronavirus stoush,"Acting US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly has resigned following criticism of his handling of a crisis involving the captain of a coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier.   Mr Modly caused controversy when he fired the USS Theodore Roosevelt's skipper, Captain Brett Crozier, last week, saying he had shown ""extremely poor judgment"" in widely distributing a letter calling for urgent help with a COVID-19 outbreak aboard his ship. Mr Modly then flew to the ship, at port in Guam, and delivered a speech to the crew in which he lambasted Captain Crozier, saying he was either ""too naive or too stupid"" to be in charge of an aircraft carrier. So far, 230 sailors aboard the ship have tested positive for coronavirus, and about 2,000 of the 4,865 crew members have been taken off. On Monday night, Mr Modly issued a public apology, but by then the calls among Democrats in Congress for his resignation were mounting.   US President Donald Trump had also indicated he might get involved in the deepening crisis. ""You have two good people and they're arguing … I'm good at settling these arguments. So I may look into it in great detail, in detail and I'll be able to figure it out very fast,"" he said. US Defence Secretary Mark Esper today confirmed he had accepted Mr Modly's resignation.   ""He resigned on his own accord, putting the Navy and the sailors above self so that the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and the Navy, as an institution, can move forward,"" Mr Esper said in a statement. His designated replacement will be James McPherson, a Navy veteran who is currently serving as undersecretary of the Army.  The episode, which began when the Roosevelt reported its first COVID-19 case among the crew on March 22, two weeks after making a port visit in Vietnam, is one of the more extraordinary dramas in recent US military history.  In addition to the health threat posed to the crew of more than 4,800 sailors, the outbreak has sidelined the warship indefinitely and created conflict at the highest levels of the Pentagon.   Mr Esper had publicly expressed his support for Mr Modly's decision to fire Captain Crozier, but after Mr Modly's speech about the ship, Mr Esper grew unsettled.  Just hours after Mr Modly issued a statement on Monday defending his words, Mr Esper compelled him to reverse course and issue a public apology. ""I want to apologise for any confusion this choice of words may have caused,"" he wrote, referring to his speech aboard the Roosevelt.  ""I also want to apologise directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused."" More than 120,000 people have since signed a petition calling on the US Navy to reinstate Captain Crozier. In videos posted online, sailors on the Theodore Roosevelt applauded him and hailed him as a hero who defended his crew at the cost of his career.       AP/Reuters",,"April 08, 2020"
