In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-political-debate-turns-to-a-way-out/12140416?section=analysis,Coronavirus political debate turns to a way out while we endure Easter in a virtual monastery,"Remember how last year's Easter felt bizarre because the country was in election mode? How normal that seems, now everything is surreal, with the nation ""holidaying"" in this peculiar, unpleasant limbo. As we contemplate the grimness we should also remember it could be much worse.  It's early days but we've dodged the horror of Italy, France, Britain, and the US. So far in Australia, the virus is being contained, the ""curve"" of new cases flattened.   Nevertheless, this Easter millions of Australians see little but uncertainty ahead, as they worry about their health, their jobs or lack or them, their businesses. The economic fear inevitably remains dialled high despite a trimmed-down Parliament (only 50-plus House of Representatives MPs out of 151) on Wednesday passing the government's $130 billion wage subsidy package.   Earlier in the week, Scott Morrison had received a Newspoll bounce in his approval, just as Kevin Rudd did in the global financial crisis. Bad as the GFC was, it's clear this crisis will be much more fraught to exit. We are only just into the restrictions but already the debate is intensifying about how and when we get out of them — a result of the relatively good news and people's natural impatience. The question occupying cooped-up households, half-dead businesses, and anxious governments (and their health advisers) is: what now? The immediate answer is simple. We need to endure Easter in a virtual monastery.  When Health Minister Greg Hunt says ""this in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus"", it is likely only a minor exaggeration. The longer term answer to ""what now"" will involve practical and ethical judgements, and contested views.     The exit strategy is uppermost in Morrison's mind — he has always bracketed ""livelihoods"" (aka the economy) with ""lives"" in his language. We're not going to jump from where we are now to that ""other side"" he and others talk about.  We will walk on a long perilous journey requiring complex decisions about steps and timing, with the risk of serious mistakes, and the certainty of pain. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says: ""We are on a life raft. We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.""  The national cabinet has asked its health experts for navigational advice. But the issue always comes back to the health-economics balance. The much-anticipated modelling the government has released didn't provide much of a compass. It told us the obvious: if we'd let the epidemic rip — which we were never going to — the health system would have been overwhelmed. The present policy is one of ""suppressing"" the virus — isolating cases, tracking contacts. Morrison believes it would be too costly to aim to eliminate COVID-19 here — the New Zealand route.   So the future choice is between attempted continued containment until there is a vaccine — a big operation in testing and tracing — or pursuing some form of ""herd immunity"".  The latter would allow the virus to move through the community (while protecting the most vulnerable).   The herd immunity path (there'd be a nicer name) would be very controversial and take more lives than attempting to maintain the suppression approach. Asked on Thursday whether it was possible, when we do unwind the various restrictions, to simultaneously pursue a suppression policy, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said: ""It's entirely possible, and that would need to be the aim. … The suppression strategy needs to be sustainable in the medium term whilst we work out things like when a vaccine becomes available, whilst we bring new molecules online to be able to treat the virus."" What is important as discussion gets underway about lifting some restrictions is that we get transparency on the health advice. This is being promised, but it's no good having modelling long after decisions are made.   There has been more than a dash of ""we know best"" in how the Government has explained things so far.  ""We're acting on medical advice"", it has said, to justify this or that measure.  But the official health advice has sometimes appeared less than consistent, and been criticised by some experts. Morrison has canvassed easing restrictions on a patchwork basis, first in places where and when it seems safest to do so. Those places would in effect be trials for elsewhere. This is logical but won't be easy.  If combined with the continuation of the suppression policy, governments must be willing to reimpose controls if case numbers increase again. And strict health protocols should be in place for how businesses and organisations deal with fresh cases. A present challenge is to manage the pressures from stakeholders and the community for an easing timetable. Innes Willox, chief of the Australian Industry Group, wrote this week in The Australian: ""We need a path back to getting the economy going again. … Businesses owners and their backers will quickly change direction, make other arrangements or move on if they don't have some hope or sense that the current restrictions aren't limitless.""   After an initial period when anyone who criticised the Government was likely to be attacked for betraying ""Team Australia"", a degree of political normality is returning, at a muted level.  Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

2,/news/2020-04-10/was-long-road-to-post-coronavirus-pandemic-normality/12139536?section=analysis,WA's road to post COVID-19 normality likely to be longer than many expect,"For many West Australians the Easter break means packing up the car and heading off to another part of this vast state.   Children, restless and ready to arrive, can taste two weeks of school holiday freedom. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" come the eager cries from the back seat. But the road we are on this Easter — as families, friends, as individuals and as a state — is a road to nowhere. Stuck at home, ordered to stay inside where possible, gathering outside only groups of two, it is an Easter like no other. And it is one in which the road to a post-pandemic normal seems to be vanishing in the distance.   The journey to where recovery begins, to where we can once again enjoy life's simple pleasures, even a Sunday lunch at a long family table, has only just begun. Almost a month into Australia's dramatic hard-line response to the coronavirus outbreak, people are wondering when that moment will come. And it is not only the children asking: ""Are we there yet?"" The answer from the state's leaders is sadly and simply: ""No"". We are not even close. If this is a marathon, the starting gun has only just been fired. WA Premier Mark McGowan this week again likened the coronavirus crisis to fighting a war. ""We've only just started our battle here in Western Australia,"" Mr McGowan said. ""The months ahead are going to be hard. They are going to be frustrating, tedious and at times even boring. ""It will test us all, but this is going to be one of the hardest things many of us will ever do.""   The State Government has moved quickly to implement what it acknowledges are extreme measures as it grapples with the crisis.   It closed WA's borders last Sunday night, effectively rendering the state an ""island within an island"". Now, only those with exemptions to that rule are allowed in. There is also no travel allowed between the state's vast regions. Those measures and countless others, some which have had devastating consequences for local business, industry and employment, have helped ""flatten the curve"". It is a nation–wide approach to slow the spread of the virus and ease the pressure on the health system, to ensure it is in the best position to care for those who do get sick. In WA, the rate of infection has remained relatively low. Six people have so far died. There are 495 diagnosed cases, although the number of new reported infections eased significantly last week. But it is important to keep in mind the criteria for those who can be tested has been quite restricted to date. That testing regime expanded on Thursday, so more results may start to reveal just how far the virus may have spread in the state.   The State Government has been encouraged by the low rates of infection, but its message was clear this week: The virus is still out there. There is no room for complacency. ""We need to keep on doing what we are doing,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Even though the numbers in WA are promising we all know just how serious this virus is. The harsh and sad reality is we will continue to lose West Australians to the virus. ""So we have no reason to get complacent now."" The State Government is pleased with the public's response to the changes, with a majority adopting and adapting quickly to the restrictions in place. But with businesses shuttered and livelihoods either lost or threatened, people across the community are wondering just how long life will be like this.   ""It's early days, these are early days and we're not going to see a quick fix for this,"" warned Health Minister Roger Cook. And Mr McGowan repeated his message that people should expect it to be the reality for six months. ""I am afraid that's the message,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Look forward to a hard, long six months.""   He said if a vaccine, or what he referred to as a ""holy grail"", was developed that timeframe would obviously change. But there is no guarantee of when, or even if, a vaccine will be available to protect the population from COVID-19 Mr McGowan knows his challenge going forward will be to keep the public's goodwill intact over the long term. ""I just hope that in a month or two … people understand that it has to continue on,"" he said. The State Government must continue to manage the delicate balance between lives and livelihoods over that time. It will need to make constant assessments about if and when restrictions can be eased over the coming months, while facing certain calls from business and industry to release the pressure. It is what one international expert explains as the three-way tug of war — ""combating disease, protecting economy and keeping society on an even keel"". Another infectious disease expert, Michael Osterholm, told the ABC's 7.30 this week a middle ground needed to be found where younger people, who were less at risk, could start to be incorporated back into everyday life. ""And then when we have evidence the virus is not circulating widely, we surely let other members of our society make the decisions for themselves,"" he said. ""And then as soon as we see that virus activity picking up immediately, we do the shelter in place again and try to squelch it.""   An expert closer to home — Executive Dean of UWA's Health and Medical Sciences Faculty Professor Jon Watson — said the forecast six-month time frame was realistic. But he believes some restrictions could be eased over the months to come. ""Gradually people will, if the curve continues to flatten, there will be requests from business and industry and tech and science and export industries, to start to relax the quite significant restrictions we have at the moment,"" Professor Watson said. But his prediction is that the 'island within an island' policy may be the last to go.   ""My sense is maybe WA will open internally for business before it opens to the other states, and then the third step will be opening internationally,"" Professor Watson said. The Premier himself is wary of making any predictions about when that might be a possibility. But he said restrictions would be reviewed monthly and amended where possible. So while it feels like we are sitting still — quite literally in our homes over the Easter break — we are moving closer the other side of this pandemic. And the Premier is urging patience and goodwill. Reminding every West Australian that it all comes down to saving lives. ""This Easter long weekend, will be very different,"" Mr McGowan said. ""For most of us it will be an Easter like never before.""  ",By Eliza Laschon,"April 10, 2020"
3,/news/2020-04-10/grandmothers-protest-reject-stereotype-social-activists/12137482?section=analysis,"Pearls out, protests in: This generation of grandmothers is kicking the tired cliches aside","Grandmothers as social activists? What a radical idea … but one that is increasingly true of today's generation of grandmothers.  A sweet memory of my time as president of the Australian Human Rights Commission was being asked by my executive assistant to look down from my Pitt Street office to the Grandmothers for Refugees singing in the street below to support the commission and its advocacy for refugees detained indefinitely in offshore detention camps. What a delight to see the men in their suits walk by in bemused wonderment. How mistaken to dismiss these grandmothers as having passed their use-by date. Why should we be surprised? This generation of grandmothers came from the '60s and '70s, many — and for the first time in history — spending formative years at university with free or minimal fees, marching against Vietnam, experimenting with sexual liberation, burning our bras and ""making love not war"". Political activism is mother's milk to many of the women from those times. Over the following years, this unique generation of women rode the crest of a wave of opportunity and optimism. The Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1984 — problem of equality fixed. The future was ours. And, to a significant degree, so it has been. Today, women over 60 are often well-educated and financially independent, having had a fruitful career while also doing a decent job of raising their children. Today, the '60s generation of women is emerging as a political force to be reckoned with.   But wait. How can it be that the position of women in Australia has been in regression over the past 15 years or so? Here are some disturbing facts. The fastest-growing group of homeless people in Australia is not 18-year-old youths sleeping under a bridge, but women over 55. How ignominious and sad to have to ask your son or niece if you can sleep on their sofa for a few weeks as you can no longer pay the rent or the mortgage. Women retire today on 46 per cent of the superannuation available to men. Why? Because we agree to accept flexible, casual and contract work with little job security or opportunities for promotion. We fall off the superannuation ladder and never catch up, despite providing most unpaid caring work across the nation. Women are still at the bottom of the employment pyramid in female-dominated industries — as hospital paramedics and cleaners, factory workers, maids and waitresses, in hotels and restaurants and in low-paid teaching and nursing positions. The gender pay gap of around 16 per cent is narrowing with glacial speed. In 2006, the World Economic Forum's Gender Index placed Australia 15th globally, broadly among the nations we would most expect to be compared with — New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Scandinavian countries. Ten years later, in 2016, we had slipped to 46th. By 2018, we had gone up a few points to 39th. Our 2020 ranking is 44th. We remain today stubbornly consigned to the lower ranks, below Serbia, Bolivia, Laos, Latvia, Cuba and Burundi.   The WEF Global Index is measured against four indices: economic participation, health and survival, educational attainment and political empowerment. The good news is that, not surprisingly, Australian women and girls are ranked first in the world for educational attainment. But now the bad news: we are a 103rd for health, 77th for ministerial positions in government, 49th for political empowerment and 46th for economic participation. Our hopes for fair access to work were raised by Tony Abbott's promise, as leader of the opposition, of a ""rolled-gold"" six months' maternity leave, only to be dashed when the political debate descended into allegations women were ""double dippers"" and ""welfare cheats"". The law for Australian women remains at 18 weeks' paid maternity leave at minimum wage, compared with Sweden's paternity leave of 480 days at 80 per cent of salary. How has it come to this? Why has education not ensured genuine equality? Why are Australia's women not in the streets demanding fairness from a male-dominated government and corporate sector? Are we, at heart, just like our grandmothers? Has very little really changed? Are grandmothers, by culture or by a law of nature, destined merely to be sweet, passive, caring and kind; to stand behind their men, support the family, love their grandchildren and seek little for themselves?   My grandmother, Sarah-Jane, met all these clichéd standards. She was born in the reign of Queen Victoria, in 1899. She admirably met the traditional image of a grandmother: pretty, even in old age, white-haired and blue-eyed. In 1958, as we stood on the deck of the Iberia, the flagship of the Orient and Pacific Line, leaving from Tilbury Docks for Australia, my mother said, ""Give your grandmother a special wave. She is old and we may not see her again."" Sarah-Jane was 62, dressed in black, wearing pearl earrings and 60-denier lisle stockings, wrinkled at her ankles. Widowed at 53, with few financial resources, she had never been employed. Sarah-Jane was largely dependent on her daughters and sons-in-law.   She came to Melbourne several times to visit us and lived to be 89. Sarah-Jane avoided any sort of disagreement or controversy in private, let alone in the public arena. ""A lady's name should appear in the newspapers only three times in her life: on birth, marriage and death."" She would have been horrified to know that her granddaughter was the subject of 42 satirical cartoons and more than 60,000 words (and counting) of newsprint castigating me for my work as president of the AHRC. For Sarah-Jane, family was all. She believed wholeheartedly in the adage that blood is thicker than water. As one of a typically large Victorian family of eight siblings, she was never particularly interested in widening her small group of friends. I have followed her directions for a successful dinner party. It was bad form, she believed, to engage in one-to-one private conversations; a general conversation among the group on a neutral topic was the desired objective. Sex and religion should never be discussed. In this, I have strayed from her protocol. But I also prefer a wide-ranging debate at dinner. When I was first married to my husband and joined international diplomatic life as a ""trailing spouse"", I remember him accusing me of conducting seminars at official dinner parties! Sarah-Jane might have been surprised to know that she has been a driving motivator in my life. As a teenager in the early '60s, I have a vivid memory of one of her visits. She was sitting up in bed, counting out her small change on the bedspread to see if she could stretch her money to buy a Christmas present for each member of the family. The sum total was pitiful. Sarah-Jane had no means to increase her funds beyond whatever the family's largesse had provided her. Mercifully, my parents were in business as jewellers and were, indeed, generous. At Christmas, we each received a modest gift from Sarah-Jane, and I treasured mine. Yet another seemingly insignificant incident compounded my understanding of my grandmother's loss of autonomy. Like Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Sarah-Jane always wore pearls: three-strand necklaces and earrings. As the earrings were clipped on (pierced ears were vulgar), she was constantly losing one. To go out in public without her pearls was unthinkable. She would ask my father, through the agency of my mother, to buy her new ones. As the saga of the lost earring was oft-repeated, my father became increasingly annoyed, but would eventually relent and provide another. I was struck at the time by the ignominy of Sarah-Jane's position.   Today, if I had lost such an item, I would simply buy a replacement without a second thought. I doubt she was ever able to enjoy that freedom. Such minuscule details of ordinary life mark how things have changed for women today who have financial autonomy. Even as a young girl, I was mortified by the evident frustration of an older woman who had so little financial independence. I vowed never to be in that position. I knew, instinctively, that to reach whatever potential one might have, it was essential, as Virginia Woolf well understood, to have ""a room of one's own"". That is not to say that money has been a catalyst for my work over the decades, but rather that a reliable income is vital to achieving autonomy. Sarah-Jane also had a steely inner core. Arriving home after school one day, I was shocked when she asked me, ""Will you do the ironing or shall I?"" As she'd left the house for work that morning, my mother had apparently airily asked my grandmother to iron the ever-mounting pile of sheets, shirts and napkins, always the last household chore to be tackled. From my mother's point of view, as Sarah-Jane was at home all day, this seemed to be an entirely reasonable request. Not so for Sarah-Jane. The heat of the summer was inescapable and enervating. She was probably about 70 years old. Far better to ask a healthy teenager. I, of course, agreed to do the ironing, but filed away for future reference that my grandmother was smarter than others gave her credit for! As Sarah-Jane sank into the oblivion of Alzheimer's, she lived out her last years in an aged-care residence in London. Whenever I returned to England, I would visit my tranquil, beautifully dressed grandmother, who, having no idea who I was, said to me, ""You're a nice young girl. Do come to see me again."" I would leave in tears, but grateful that Sarah-Jane had at least found some sort of serenity.   Delving into these sepia-tinted flashes from the past, I am surprised by how powerful — even hurtful — they remain. Why would I care today about such fleeting incidents, which one might have imagined would quickly fade? I do not know. But perhaps the psychologists would say that such early experiences shape our adult lives in profound, lasting and unexpected ways. Sarah-Jane would not recognise my 21st-century role as a grandmother. At 74, I am working, travelling and continuing to be outspoken. My grandchildren, Sia (aged four) and Leonard (aged two), live an international life in Paris and are becoming bilingual. I speak to them by Skype and babysit for a couple of weeks in July when the creches and schools are closed for the summer. Every second year, they come to Australia for Christmas. I have some French and would love to speak to my grandchildren in their first language. Rightly, their parents, my son James and his French partner, Marie, insist that I speak only English, otherwise Sia and Leonard will adopt the easy option of French. Sia thinks I am intellectually rather slow. If I mispronounce a word in French or make a grammatical error (quelle horreur), she corrects me and, in exasperation, employs both the English and French words to ensure I get her point. I love being with such bright, energetic children and am sometimes sad that I am a distant, fly-in, fly-out spectre in their lives. My relationship with my grandchildren will be very different from many grandparenting relationships of the past. Different but, I hope, just as special. The geographical distance means that I will not be part of the day-to-day lives of Sia and Leonard. I will not be able to pick them up from school and hear their triumphs and woes. I will always be the visitor who swans into town, breaks the household rules with forbidden treats and goes away again. I will not be there to listen to whispered hopes and fears, nor will I be a gentle, calm and constant presence in their lives. But I will bring to Sia and Leonard that fierce loyalty for family that Sarah-Jane maintained, rightly or wrongly, as well as her warmth and integrity. I hope to be a strong influence in their lives; to stimulate, excite and support them in every way possible. Perhaps I can show them what a woman can achieve in her lifetime, given the opportunity and a dash of determination.   I suspect many women today grapple with finding a new version of the contemporary grandmother, as they retain a traditional view of a caring woman with little autonomy or life beyond her family. Grandmothers today are likely to be healthy, relatively fit and up for a game of tennis or a ski trip (on the moderate slopes). With some significant exceptions (for example, those who have no superannuation, live alone or have high medical expenses), today's grandmother will have financial means of her own, a career and a fruitful, active life. She will nurture her grandchildren, but will be less passive, more actively engaged with the world, freer to rise to her own potential and, I suggest, happier than many grandmothers in the past, with greater self-confidence. While my generation has been uniquely privileged in so many ways, I believe that, as grandmothers, we should use our remaining years and decades to reach out to our less privileged sisters to bring them with us. Too many women have been left behind. The promises of the '60s and '70s have not been met fully for all Australian women. We grandmothers now have a responsibility to advocate, to be politically active in using our education and financial independence to ensure equality of opportunity and outcome. For all women.   How dismaying that I should have studied for a law degree, a Master of Laws and a PhD, all at the expense of the Australian, American and British taxpayers, while law students today will finish their JD degree $100,000 in debt. As grandmothers, we should be demanding affordable childcare, full superannuation even when on maternity and carers leave, equal pay for equal work, freedom from sexual harassment and bullying in employment, and protection from domestic violence at home. As grandmothers, what do we have to lose? We are not looking for advancement in our careers. We are strong, healthy and independent. Bravo to Grandmothers for Refugees, the Older Women's Network and the scores of other women's advocacy and networking groups. Let us work together to harness the power of today's generation of grandmothers, who can and will speak up for social justice. Let us work together to achieve the vision of gender equality that we and our political leaders had in the 60s and 70s. I like to think that, in Sarah-Jane's quiet way, she would have supported my outspokenness on human rights and forgiven me my notorious media presence. I now understand better the continuing influence she has had on my life, and thank her for it. Postscript: I am about to leave for Geneva to take up a new role in the United Nations as Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. For the first time in my grandchildren's lives, I will be only three hours by train from Paris. It seems one should never say never. Maybe in the future I can be a more real presence in their lives than I had believed possible.

4,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-community-sport-clubs-feeling-impact-of-pandemic/12137910?section=analysis,Community sporting clubs will feel the pinch as coronavirus pandemic hits grassroots levels,"At the historic oval near my inner-suburban home, the customary seasonal transition is in eerie abeyance. The turf wicket would by now usually have been pockmarked by the boots of stampeding footballers and the goal posts erected. Instead, the thin white posts remain in their storage pods near the cricket nets, while the turf square is sprouting autumnal grass, protected by high-tech security (a flimsy rope and two small ""keep off"" signs). Workmen continue to install a new scoreboard that will display the achievements of suburban champs. But no one knows whether its luminous digits will first record goals and behinds, or runs and wickets. The scene is no doubt similar at most country and suburban grounds, the sporting and social hubs of communities that now instead host determinedly sombre socially distanced workouts.   Inevitably the media focus on the impact of the deadly coronavirus pandemic on sport has highlighted the deprivation of AFL and NRL matches and the sundry costs and contingencies.   Most recently we have been confronted by anxious administrators trying to stave off financial ruin by concocting ever more desperate measures to get players back on the field, even if playing on islands or in clusters would risk creating the potentially ruinous air of ""normality"" our political leaders have rightly suppressed.   Amid the huffing of these panic-stricken sporting bureaucrats and the unseemly haggling over the percentages to be cut from vast playing contracts, there has been a consoling thought.   Sport is not imperilled by the financial knock-ons from this deadly pandemic because sport is not merely what we see on the TV or in a packed stadium. Sport at its most basic is a kid with a bat and ball or a racquet or just a pair of runners, regardless of where the evolution of various games through codification, professionalism, mass audience appeal and ""elite performance"" has taken them. But even viewed through the rosiest lens, this does not mean the suburban warriors of community sport are immune from the havoc coronavirus has wrought at the professional levels. When various national governing bodies tightened their stranglehold on the grassroots — in some cases for the greater good — sport became, even more so, a trickle-down economy. So the loss of overall revenue generated through media rights, sponsorship and gate receipts will have a profound impact on how much support will be provided to suburban leagues and clubs. Consequently, the likely sporting depression will provide a test of the priorities and the commitment of administrators to the most important level of sport — the community base that props up the sporting pyramid. Funding for the loss-making women's professional leagues currently driving mass participation will provide a similar insight into their long-term vision.   At local level a flattened economy will have an immediate impact on community clubs that typically rely on sponsorship from the kind of small businesses — such as pubs, restaurants and real estate agents — that have taken the biggest financial hits. The explosion in entry-level and early-age junior participation has also created a steady stream of revenue for many clubs and, in some cases, a heavy reliance on junior memberships to fund overall operations. Will parents hard hit by the depressed economy continue to pay? Will kids return after a gap season in which they have formed an even greater bond with — you might say addiction to —their PlayStations and iPhones? Will senior players who already struggled to come up with their subs — or even be able to pay them — return? Most pertinently, will the governing bodies enjoying a generational benefit from the current participation boom fund their own form of stimulus package to help clubs ensure the now cash-strapped and disadvantaged can still play? Football, particularly, has a bottom-to-top financial model that has imposed sometimes outlandish fees on juniors used to prop up senior teams and even Football Federation Australia itself. This was a controversial topic before the pandemic and could now be — as much as the future of the A-League and W-League — a major source of vulnerability for the sport's continued growth.   Another key funding question for community clubs is whether government grants for infrastructure promised (and in some cases misappropriated) before the pandemic struck can still be delivered given the billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to wage relief and other emergency initiatives. The provision of female change rooms has been a key focus of government grants, given the enormous growth in girl's and women's cricket, football and Australian rules particularly. The best hope might be that grants can still be justified in order to provide stimulus for the building industry. Inevitably even the most prosperous local clubs will find themselves asking similar questions to their professional counterparts: Do they need to pay as much for that half-back or recruit the ex-first grade batsman who might have helped win a premiership?   This might not be such a bad thing for those clubs who have been caught up in the inflated premiership-chasing cash-in-hand economy that distorts the raison d'etre of some even supposedly ""amateur"" clubs. But during the hiatus it is the simple absence of the gathering of weekend tribes that will be felt most, particularly in those country towns where the people you see at the footy on Saturday afternoon might be the only ones you see all week. For now, the new scoreboard near my house merely creates an impatience for the days when its numbers will, like the faces in front of the old grandstand, light up. Offsiders will air a special on the impact of COVID-19 on community sport at 10:00am (AEST) on Sunday on ABC TV.    ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 10, 2020"
5,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-empty-nest-full-again/12123600?section=analysis,Coronavirus self-isolation with my adult children is like a blast from the past,"A lot of us are in lockdown with kids in the house. But what do you do when those kids are university students who haven't lived at home for months? In a city where rents are expensive, and the interstate university colleges where they used to live are closed, my family finds itself in self-isolation with two university students who are studying online. Suddenly, we are a family of four again. I was delighted to have our beautiful young adults back with us. We were hoping to take advantage of reassimilating and getting to know each other again, doing the quality-time thing.  But it's a different landscape to raising school-age children. For one, the hours are different.   As I write this it's about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I've been up with my husband since before 7am and Uni Student One, who is 20, has just got out of bed.  The younger one is still asleep. We don't expect him to grace us with his presence before 5pm.   Living with uni students is like living with perpetual jetlag except that it is not your own. We aren't operating on the same time zones. Now let me qualify this: they haven't been out disobeying the Government's directions to not socialise in groups of more than two. They haven't had any mates to the house — we are self-isolating after all. They haven't even left the house in over a week.  So far, so legally good. Yet neither of them were in bed until after 5am so they are catching up on their eight hours. Like the possums and bats that frequent the nightscape around where we live, I've discovered my sons are nocturnal: their natural hours of wakefulness barely coincide with mine.  I'm used to a little coming and going during the night (okay sometimes more than a little) but it's an adjustment having them back, and for them too after the freedoms of living away.   It's not just the time zones that are different. The culture shock is real too. While in lockdown, one son has decided to take up a hobby: he's learning guitar.  And while it might be lovely to be strummed to sleep it's far less enjoyable being awoken in the middle of the night to the sound of someone attempting to learn a Jimmy Hendrix riff. (And I stress that's not ""playing"", just ""learning"", which means repeating the same series of chords over and over and over again, and singing the same lyrics on repeat).   Uni Student 2, traditionally the more sporty of the two, has set up a home gym out the back of the house and in the garage using whatever he can cobble together. This means some old weights, some kitchen items, the broom, a back pack with what I think must be dirt inside. Frankly, I don't want to know. I was so looking forward to life with my children again. But instead, life with the uni students means every four bars of Hendrix's Foxy Lady is punctuated with the great thud of a dropped weight on the concrete or a loud grunt of exertion. My sons' body clocks make it impossible for us to time meals together (so much for that quality time).  Hubby and I eat regularly at 7.30pm and the meal we choose at that time is called dinner. Not breakfast.   Dinner for the nocturnal members of the household occurs around 3am and involves microwaving the prepared family meal that they couldn't eat at their ""breakfast"" time. If they are still hungry, I can look forward to a cacophony of banging. It's not weights or music this time, but pots and pans, kitchen drawers, microwave oven doors and fridge doors, over and over again. It finishes not long before my day to begins again, at 6am, with the aftermath from this 3am banquet they didn't quite manage to clean up. So what to do with people who are vibrantly alive in the middle of the night while us parents are trying to sleep in order to be ready to work from home in the morning?  There's plenty of advice for home schooling or entertaining 10-year-olds with online trips to the zoo or recycled craft projects. But what do you do with young people who are a little too old to be sent to bed or the naughty corner? In this household, it's a dilemma that has added a strange new layer to self-isolation. And even though they're young adults it reminds of a time when we used to be awoken to the cries of hunger or the dirty nappy and the argument about who had to get up earlier for work tomorrow and who could do without sleep and get up and change the baby! We'll be thankful they toilet themselves now and feed themselves at whatever time. Because for the first time in a while we're all back together, in the one nest, with time to laugh about who was the loudest baby, who was the most terrible two year old and who made Mum angry. Best of all we get to enjoy those Dad jokes all over again! Who would have thought that there was a silver lining to coronavirus lockdown but it's nice to have time to be ""us four"" again.  So we continue to be patient, as much as we can, for as long as this time lasts.    ",By Mary-Elizabeth Brien,"April 10, 2020"
6,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482?section=analysis,"What causes a 'second wave' outbreak of coronavirus, and could we see this in Australia?","Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing. However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection. As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.     Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one. If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away. When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity. If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.   Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection. Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last. The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely. As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.   A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission. If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave. When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.   Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate. Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection. In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound. We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave. However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19. Australia's current efforts are focused on ""flattening the curve"" of the first wave of COVID-19. Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising. But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave. And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward. We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

7,/news/2020-04-09/how-bernie-sanders-lost-to-joe-biden/12135900?section=analysis,Why Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic presidential primary to Joe Biden,"The year was 1981. The place was Burlington, Vermont. And Bernard Sanders had just been elected the city's mayor by 10 votes, a race so close, and so full of novel ideas, that it drew national attention. ""The problem with the word socialism is that very often it gets equated to what's going on in the Soviet Union — with authoritarianism and totalitarianism and so forth,"" he said in the chanty cadence and shouty tone he'd come to be known for. ""Do I believe the profit motive is fundamental to human nature? The answer is no. I believe the spirit of cooperation is stronger.""   Had you placed those Sanders comments in the year 1991 or 2016 or 2020, no-one would have blamed you. Since that interview, the advent of his 40-year career in politics, Sanders has never once shied away from his ideas, using nearly every moment of his adult existence to fight for principles Americans consider too radical to put into practice. His will of belief was seen as his strongest asset by his supporters. But it may well be the reason he couldn't get the party to rally around him in the end. On Thursday he ended his second (and likely final) campaign for president, opening the door for his moderate rival Joe Biden to win the nomination and take on Donald Trump. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn in economic stagnation, watching America roil with protests and sit-ins, freedom rides and notions of change.   He lived in the thick of it, travelling to civil rights demonstrations and working as a political organiser, finally venturing into politics in his late thirties and successfully transforming a struggling small town into a blossoming city.  His popularity in Vermont landed him 16 years in the US House of Representatives, then three terms as a US senator. Though Sanders filled those offices as an independent, he almost always voted with the Democrats. His decision to run in 2016 was with that party in mind. He felt American progressives weren't hearing his far-left ideas. ""This is not an individual thing, this is not a personal thing,"" he said in a 2013 interview with Politico. ""It would be a disaster for this country to go through a campaign where you had candidates who are not talking about the collapse of the middle class, growing wealth and income inequality, growth in poverty, global warming."" He worried about the consequences of a failed run, but in the end, believed he had a decent shot of beating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. The establishment either did not, or did, and dreaded it. Coverage of his campaign launch ran on page 21 of the New York Times.   But by the end of that failed run, Sanders had become a household name thanks to a certain strength: voters knew what he stood for. Clinton put it this way in her campaign memoir, What Happened: ""I have a new appreciation for the galvanising power of big, simple ideas."" When Sanders announced he was running again in 2019, the New York Times ran the story on its cover.  The senator raised more than $US18 million [$29 million] through small, individual donations in his first six weeks of campaigning.   That fundraising power would continue to propel Sanders to the top of the historically big and diverse field of candidates. But all the while the moderate wing of the Democratic Party was still sceptical of Sanders' beliefs, and even progressives thought he had obstacles to the nomination. One was the belief that Sanders, age 78, was too old to take on the nomination. Those worries amplified in October when he suffered a heart attack, the kind of health disaster that would end other candidates' campaigns. For Sanders, the medical emergency was shortly followed by a rise in the polls, thanks in part to the strength of his campaign surrogates. The first rally Sanders held after his heart attack was headlined by Democratic darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   He only gained ground from there, earning endorsements from hundreds of celebrities and influencers and becoming the most popular candidate with Democrats under the age of 35. Even with that popularity — or maybe because of it — some worried that Sanders' stubborn commitment to progressive ideals could never do enough to unify the Democratic base. ""Everyone's just talking about electability,"" one Sanders supporter told the ABC ahead of the nation's first democratic nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. ""I'm putting my money on Biden, and I'll vote for him if he's the one that can beat Trump."" The first two primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire were messy, but Sanders walked away a winner in both. He defied expectations in the third, Nevada, by securing the normally-moderate Latino vote in overwhelming numbers. Turnout in the state broke records, in part thanks to Sanders' appeal. Everything changed with the fourth state, South Carolina, where 40 per cent of the Democratic electorate is African American. An overwhelming majority of that demographic coalesced around Joe Biden.   The win was so secure it was announced within the first two minutes of votes being counted. It'd be tough to overstate how critical this vote looked to US politics watchers. African American voters are among the most consistently Democratic, and a group historically shown to be harmed by a Republican president.   Though Biden heavily focused on African American voters throughout the campaign, his policies and voting record weren't always as favourable to them as they could be. With Sanders still preaching his big policies, Biden's win in South Carolina revealed that the voters at the core of the Democratic Party still had their minds set on one question: who would beat Trump?  Jason Johnson, former politics editor for the African American-focused publication The Root, put it this way: ""Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States."" The Democratic Party, too, started thinking about what white people would do in the general election.  The day before Super Tuesday, two popular moderate candidates dropped out of the race and threw their support behind Biden in a show of force against Sanders. Sanders' supporters were undaunted. In Los Angeles, more than 20,000 of them packed into an auditorium to hear him speak.   ""I think Biden did a lot of work in South Carolina … but people can't ignore the bloc of Sanders' support,"" one told the ABC then. Uncommitted voters believed differently. As Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, exit polls showed that an unusually high number of voters made up their minds 24 hours before voting, and a majority of those late-deciders chose Biden. In the US, concern about coronavirus hit suddenly and decisively around mid-March, pushing politics to the periphery in news bulletins but not necessarily in the minds of Americans. Healthcare was front of mind. So too was the economy. Presidential leadership mattered in a way it hadn't during the Russia probe or Ukraine scandal. With sports and TV shows cancelled, millions of Americans tuned in to the first one-on-one debate featuring Biden and Sanders.   Biden, aided by the lack of a cheering crowd, laid out step-by-step plans for how he'd fight the virus if he were president today.  Sanders stuck to the same policy ideas he always had, talking about redistributing wealth and overhauling the healthcare system. ""It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That does not solve the problem at all,"" Biden responded.  ""People are looking for results, not a revolution."" The next round of primaries again went to Biden. Then the next. Living through a world turned upside down, Americans went the way of South Carolina and decided they could no longer entertain the idea of a political revolution or a sudden shift to socialist policies. They wanted safety, security and predictability. They wanted Joe Biden. Three weeks and thousands of American COVID-19 cases later, Sanders concluded it would be better if he left the race to allow the party to unify around the presumptive nominee. ""Please know that I do not make this decision lightly,"" he told his supporters. ""If I believe we had a feasible path to the nomination I would continue, but it's just not there."" ""But let me say this very emphatically: As you all know, we have never been just a campaign. We are a grassroots, multiracial, multigenerational movement.""   It's the kind of thing that all politicians say when bowing out gracefully, but when Sanders says his campaign was more than a campaign, he really means it. The Republicans in Congress and the President may not have been thinking about Sanders when they passed the first coronavirus bill, but there are echoes of his platform throughout it: government-subsidised healthcare, unemployment insurance, tax cuts to gig workers.   The conservative governments of America's closest allies — Australia and the UK — have enacted similar stimulus packages despite standing opposite Sanders on the ideological spectrum. At a time when the world is at its most dark and desperate, leaders have turned to some of the ideas Sanders has promoted for decades. ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe,"" Sanders said at the beginning of his speech on Thursday. ""Together we have transformed, in the American consciousness, what kind of nation we can become."" He ended his remarks with a single pledge, as if it was ever a question in the minds of Americans — to keep fighting for what he believes in.  ",By Emily Olson in Washington DC,"April 09, 2020"
8,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-jk-rowling-breathing-technique-debunked/12134128?section=analysis,"Does JK Rowling's breathing technique cure the coronavirus? No, it could help spread it","Harry Potter author JK Rowling says a breathing technique has helped her coronavirus-like respiratory symptoms, a claim that has been widely reported and shared on social media. Her tweet includes a video from a UK hospital doctor describing the technique, a type of controlled coughing. This involves taking six deep breaths and on the last one covering your mouth and coughing.   The internet is full of home grown cures for the coronavirus. And when doctors propose them, they appear credible. While special breathing techniques have their place in hospital, under the supervision of a respiratory physiotherapist or respiratory doctor, and for certain medical conditions, using them at home to manage coronavirus symptoms could be dangerous. The technique in the video could help spread the coronavirus to people close by.   By coughing, you could directly infect people with droplets, or these droplets on someone's hands can be transferred to a surface others can touch. So JK Rowling's well-meaning advice could inadvertently help spread the virus to your family, or to the person next to you on the bus.   The cells in our lungs produce a sticky mucus as part of our body's defence system. And when we have a viral lung infection, such as with the virus that causes COVID-19 or the influenza virus, we produce more of it. The mucus traps the invading pathogen. Normally, this mucus is removed from the lungs by the movement of tiny hair-like projections in our airways. From there, we either swallow the mucus or cough it out as phlegm. However, sometime we produce so much mucus it is difficult to breathe. The mucus can block our tiny airways, preventing us from obtaining oxygen from our lungs. In other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, controlled coughing can help remove the mucus and make it easier for people to breathe. This technique may be done as part of chest physiotherapy, along with other lung clearance techniques, in a hospital. The technique is not dangerous, but the contents of what is coughed out can be.   So what's the evidence controlled coughing could help people manage their coronavirus symptoms? Put simply, there are no clinical trials or good evidence. One common COVID-19 symptom is a dry cough. So it's difficult to imagine why controlled coughing would help when you're coughing so much anyway. There is a very real risk that unintentionally this technique would actually spread the virus. When we cough we produce a lot of droplets of mucus from the lungs that are spread as a spray. My research has also shown breathing out forcefully is enough to propel viruses from the lungs this way. Either way large sprays of viruses could infect other people.   In hospital, this risk is minimised by having specialised negative pressure rooms that remove the contaminated air. Patients wear masks to capture the sprays and clinical staff wear personal protective equipment, including masks and face shields. There are also strict infection control measures, such as limits on visitors and hand washing. Yet the risks of transmission remain high. But if you practise controlled coughing at home or on the bus, it's easy to see how you could inadvertently spread the virus. And of course, the technique doesn't kill the virus or cure anyone. So why did JK Rowling endorse this technique? In essence, it's because she believed it helped her, and thought it would help others. However, her tweet says she hadn't been tested for COVID-19, so it's not certain she had the infection. And she may or may not have benefited from the technique. Perhaps her symptoms may have improved by themselves anyway. It's hard to know. My advice is to seek medical advice if you suspect you have the coronavirus rather than rely on testimonials, however well meaning.

9,"/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-could-cause-240,000-deaths-in-indonesia/12131778?section=analysis","Coronavirus is on the verge of exploding in Indonesia and 240,000 could die","Almost no-one thinks Indonesia is handling the COVID-19 pandemic well. Until early March, the government claimed it had no cases of infection, something the eccentric health minister Terawan Agus Putranto attributed to prayer.  The Home Affairs Minister urged the public to eat more bean sprouts and broccoli, while President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) sang the praises of jamu, traditional herbal remedies. The government had been in denial. Terawan dismissed as ""insulting"" a report by Harvard University researchers saying Indonesia must have unreported cases. As recently as last Friday, another minister was still arguing the virus cannot survive in tropical climates. Jokowi was apparently more concerned about the threat the virus posed to trade, investment and tourism.  In February, when many countries were imposing tough travel restrictions, he planned to offer discounts of up to 30 per cent to attract tourists. His government even allocated almost $8 million to pay social media influencers for tourism promotions.   On March 2, Indonesia finally acknowledged COVID-19 had reached the archipelago.  Jokowi admitted, as many suspected, his government had withheld information from the public ""to avoid panic"". And then it finally began to act. The government banned mass gatherings, imposed so-called ""large-scale social restrictions"" and barred foreigners from entering the country. It announced it will release 30,000 prisoners from the country's notoriously overcrowded and unhealthy prisons and will spend an additional $40 billion on medical needs, social support and relief for small and medium businesses Last week, Jokowi even toyed with the idea of declaring a civil emergency (similar to martial law) before quickly backtracking. It is not hard to see why Jokowi finally admitted what most Indonesians guessed long ago, but we still don't have all the facts. Indonesia has recorded more than 2,400 infections and 209 deaths, but these figures are based on just 11,500 tests, a tiny sample in a nation of nearly 270 million.   There are indications many cases and deaths are going undetected. Reuters examined data from Jakarta's Department of Parks and Cemeteries and found 4,400 burials were conducted in the province in March, an increase of 40 per cent above normal levels. But even by the conservative official figures, the mortality rate of 9 per cent is one of the highest in the world, although this could be because of insufficient testing. In any case, scientists at the University of Indonesia have predicted that if stricter measures do not start immediately, the situation could spin out of control, with up to 240,000 deaths by the end of April. Tragically, widespread testing, proper treatment and tough and effective social isolation measures are unlikely to happen soon. The government is scrambling to prepare its health system to cope, but this looks like an impossible task. Indonesia has just four doctors and 12 hospital beds per 1,000 people, and less than three intensive care beds per 100,000. These levels are way below World Health Organisation or Asia-Pacific standards. An extreme shortage of ventilators will likely result in many avoidable deaths, especially in regional areas.   A specialist COVID-19 hospital has been opened in Jakarta, and the old Vietnamese refugee camp on Galang Island is being refurbished to create another. But it will take a lot more than this if hundreds of thousands are infected – not least because Indonesia is a respiratory disease tinderbox. It has one of the highest proportions of male smokers in the world, and its five leading causes of death are all tobacco-related. The bad relations between the Ministry of Health and doctors won't help either. There is also a serious lack of protective equipment for health care workers. Some have been told they can turn up to work in raincoats.  At least 24 doctors have died so far, about 11 per cent of all recorded deaths.   Even social isolation will be extraordinarily difficult in such a densely populated country with a laissez-faire attitude to rules and a tradition of bribing police.  Moreover, up to 70 per cent of the workforce is employed in the informal sector and many live hand-to-mouth. Working from home may simply not be an option for them. To make matters worse, millions have been preparing for mudik, the traditional visit home for Muslims in the lead-up to the Idul Fitri (Eid) celebration on May 23.  Last year, more than 18 million Indonesians travelled during this time. It is hard to imagine an event more likely to trigger a catastrophic outbreak.   Jokowi has warned of the dangers of mudik, but seems reluctant to take tough measures to prevent it. He is in no-win situation. If he does ban mudik he will be a target for criticism from political enemies who like to portray him as an insincere Muslim. If he doesn't, he will be attacked for exposing millions to the virus. Already, Anies Baswedan, the high-profile governor of Jakarta, has criticised Jokowi's handling of the crisis, calling for much tougher measures to reduce the spread of the virus. But Jokowi appears to have again put economic considerations before public health, opting instead for ""large-scale social restrictions"" rather than quarantines or banning mudik outright.   Stricter regional quarantines or lockdowns would undoubtedly depress economic activity. What's more, under the 2018 Health Quarantine Law, the government would then incur the huge costs of being responsible for all the basic needs of citizens in those areas. It would also concern Jokowi that the virus has triggered an outburst of anti-Chinese hate speech, never far below the surface in Indonesia. Online trolls are accusing the Chinese of introducing the virus to Indonesia and wealthier Chinese of fleeing to the safety of Singapore. There have already been violent protests against Chinese workers in a number of locations. Jokowi's close association with former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian, coupled with the president's determined courting of Chinese investment, will make Jokowi vulnerable if anti-Chinese sentiment escalates further.   Jokowi has now brought in the police, armed forces and national intelligence agency to help manage the crisis. This is in line with the creeping securitisation that has marked Jokowi's rule, and these agencies will take any opportunity to gain a greater foothold.

10,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-mail-in-ballots-could-give-trump-election-advantage/12132302?section=analysis,Coronavirus couldn't force Republicans to delay the Wisconsin primary. That's good news for Donald Trump.,"Two-hour queues. Closed polling locations. Confusion, frustration and fear of catching a virus that's claimed 12,000 lives in the US already. That's what thousands of voters in Wisconsin faced on Wednesday as they participated in a primary election that ploughed ahead after a zig-zagging display of partisanship and power. The state showed us what happens when voting marches forward in the midst of a pandemic. But there's just as much to be learned from the path that Wisconsin's politicians took to deciding the election should proceed unchanged.   It's the same path that the US Federal Government has started walking down. Just three weeks ago, the quiet midwestern state had only reported 400 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  Wisconsin's Democratic Governor and Republican Congress were in agreement that the election, which entailed both local contests and the democratic presidential primary, should proceed.   Wisconsin, one of the great ""bellwether states"", has a long record of voting for the eventual White House winner, regardless of his political party. But when it came to the Democratic primary, the state was expected to further solidify Joe Biden's lead over Bernie Sanders.   Though the results of Wednesday's contest won't be released until April 13, Biden leads Sanders by 28 points in the latest polls. State officials were more concerned with carrying out the general election. The thinking was that new judges, sheriffs and mayors — whose new terms begin next week — might be critical to helping fight the virus. But then other states started delaying their contests (now up to 16 in total), and the number of cases in Wisconsin rose to 2,500. Experts forecasted the virus would rapidly spread during the first two weeks of April. Wisconsin municipalities, realizing that 60 per cent of polling stations would be understaffed as older volunteers stayed home, called for the election to be cancelled or postponed. Four days before the election, the Governor heeded those calls. He convened a special session of the only group with the power to actually change the election — the state congress — and asked them to consider shifting the entire election to vote by mail.   Wisconsin's Republican leaders ended the special session in less than 60 seconds. They said that the change would be ""logistically impossible"" on such short notice and added that relaxing the state's strict voter-ID laws around mail-in ballots would lead only to fraud. The Republican-controlled state Supreme Court ruled that the Democratic governor lacked the power to implement any changes unilaterally. The Republican-leaning federal Supreme Court concurred on one part, saying that the governor couldn't extend the deadline to register for a mail-in ballot (though a record 1.2 million Wisconsinites managed to register in time). Andrew Hitt, the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, cheered the moves. He told the Atlantic that ""making such a dramatic change in how we do elections in a crisis is probably not good public policy."" ""That's how you do poor public policy, by doing it in a hurry,"" he said. Federal politicians are hoping to avoid last-minute discussion and decision-making should coronavirus threaten November's Presidential election.   Democrats tried to set aside $US2 billion ($3.2 billion) in the last coronavirus stimulus plans to guarantee universal mail-in voting, but Republicans only agreed to $US400 million for elections None of it was earmarked specifically for mail-in voting.   The Republican opposition to mail-in voting goes all the way to the top of the ticket. President Trump told reporters that ""people cheat with mail-in voting"". ""It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don't send it in the mail where people can pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen … by the time it gets in and is tabulated.""   It's a line he's used since 2016, when he made baseless claims that he lost the popular vote because mail-in ballots were inaccurately counted. Now, his campaign is reportedly working closely with the Republican National Party to launch a multi-million-dollar ad campaign against proposals to change voting in any way. Experts say it's pretty easy to compare ballot signatures to the ones states keep on file, although it can lead to delays in counting.   The five states that hold their elections entirely by mail haven't reported an outsized issue with fraud. But the experience of those states do give merit to another Republican hang-up, which is that voting by mail is by no means logistically simple.  The word from Wisconsin is that many of the 1.2 million voters who requested mail-in ballots didn't receive them in time or properly submit them. For the states with successful mail-in voting measures, it took years and money to hammer out a smooth process. Some of it has to do with equipment and education, but perhaps the biggest part of it has to do with the time it takes to change bureaucracy, which brings us back to the Republican opposition.   There's a long history of Republicans using the line about voter fraud to cover up their real concern: increasing voter turnout.   Research by nonpartisan voting groups show that even the option of vote-by-mail increases turnout by several percentage points, driven by minority groups like Hispanics, who more reliably vote for Democrats. The Republicans in Wisconsin didn't explicitly cite this as a concern, but those in other states did. The House Speaker in Georgia, when deciding the fate of his own state's election, said that absentee ballots would be ""extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia. Every registered voter is going to get one of these. … This will certainly drive up turnout."" The odd irony to all this talk about political parties manipulating the election to maintain power is that in Wisconsin, the result will be contested regardless of how it falls.  No one will have faith in the integrity of the outcome, not to mention the leaders swept into place because of it.  Wednesday's election is the first in a long time to end without a trace of speculation, celebration or excitement about the big winners. All anyone can talk about is the voters.

When it comes to the choice between death on an unimaginable scale or wholesale economic destruction, all boiled down into competing dollar signs, it's impossible to emerge with any sense of dignity.  But these decisions, cruel and calculating, are being made across the globe as armies of actuaries, economists, epidemiologists and bureaucrats crunch the numbers for politicians on how best to find a balance between how many they are prepared to let die and the ongoing cost to those who will survive.  It's called modelling — a nice term, bland and somehow even mildly reassuring, as though we are in control of our destiny.    To some extent, we are.  We could shut down the economy indefinitely, seal off the borders and pour every ounce of our energy into defeating, with minimal loss of life, a hidden killer — a virus that has cut a swathe through China, Europe, and the United States, and that has gained a foothold here.  Or we could let it rip, carry on with life normally, and simply watch on in horror as the virus wreaks its path of destruction.  The pain would be far more intense, but the duration — of the disease at least — much shorter.  Both those extremes could lead to a complete breakdown of society and our future wellbeing.    At the very least, either scenario has the potential to seriously destabilise our political systems and our economy. As Prime Minister, Scott Morrison has to chart a course between these extremes: to save as many people as possible, with one eye on the future to ensure those who remain have some form of income. Sounds easy, huh? Ultimately, the decision comes down to dollars. What monetary value do you place on a human being, on life itself?  Callous as they are, these decisions are being made right now, in Canberra, London, Rome, Beijing, Madrid, Washington, Jakarta, Johannesburg: everywhere that COVID-19 has invaded populations.   This week, one economist suggested the benchmark expenditure is $4 million for a baby likely to live to 80.  For anyone older, you work out the dollars accordingly. Writing in the Australian Financial Review, former chief economist at CSL Sam Lovick argued these decisions are not new, that governments routinely reject subsidising life-saving medicines because of their cost, and that similar calculations are used in road safety.  That's true. Airlines run the numbers over how much to spend on maintenance and the probability of equipment failure.  When Brendan Murphy, the medical expert advising government, fronted the media to explain the modelling, his was the language of medicine and quarantine, of time and hospital capacity.  The tools being employed — closing borders, quarantining and social distancing — really do work, he said.   They have bought us time and, with 35,000 extra intensive care beds, will deliver us enough resources to deal with the infirm.  But he was careful to avoid the issue of cost. When he did, it was purely in terms of epidemiology.    Chinese authorities attempted to eradicate the virus with the complete shutdown of Wuhan, ultimately without success. A similar program here, he explained, would deny us immunity to the virus and would require controlled borders for a very long time.  Time comes at an enormous cost.  A complete shutdown of the economy for an indefinite period would ruin countless lives, destroy families and jeopardise future generations.  The Prime Minister was at pains to point out that the strategy and the modelling was designed to ensure our health systems could cope with the expected rise in infections and sickness that we needed to return to normality. The $240 billion economic lifeline has a finite life. It comes to an end in just a few months, even though as a nation we will be paying for it for years, even decades, to come.    Politically, there are no winners from this gamble with death.  The leaders of Italy, Spain and America will be castigated for not heeding the warnings and allowing the unnecessary deaths of thousands of their countrymen.  If Mr Morrison succeeds in limiting the health fallout for Australians and we emerge with benign indifference, he most likely will be scolded for reckless overspending and saddling the nation with debt.

12,/news/2020-04-08/george-pell-aquitted-high-court-sexual-abuse/12130064?section=analysis,George Pell's successful appeal hinged on the tricky question of witnesses,"Cardinal George Pell had a win in the High Court yesterday, but it would be regrettable if the outcome of the case made it less likely that victims of sexual abuse will report offences against them.  The High Court, in acquitting Pell, clarified the approach that judges and jurors should take in evaluating the persuasiveness of witness testimony. But it is important to highlight that this decision did not undermine the principle that sexual offenders can be convicted solely on the basis of evidence from the complaint. The outcome of the decision is confined to the unusual facts of the case and this is the most important message that must be taken from the judgment. Child sexual abuse, by its intrinsic nature, is a private act. It is rare that there would be witnesses, other than the victim.   It has taken decades for police, prosecution authorities and the courts to understand that the lack of corroborating evidence in sexual offence cases does not mean the prosecution will fail. The outcome of the decision in the case of Pell does not change that reality. The central issue in the Pell judgement was how the courts should weigh evidence given by a credible witness if it is at odds with other evidence that casts doubt on the witness's story. The only direct evidence against Pell was the testimony of one complainant. The trial judge found the complainant to be a credible witness.   So did two Victorian Appeal Court judges. Chief Justice Anne Ferguson and Victorian Court of Appeal president Chris Maxwell stated: ""Both the content of what [the complainant] said and the way in which he said it — including the language he used — appeared to us to be entirely authentic"".  The other member of the Victorian Appeal Court, Justice Mark Weinberg disagreed. He stated that the ""complainant's allegations against the applicant were, to one degree or another, implausible"".   This was not just a difference in opinion but a difference in methodology in determining guilt and innocence in cases where the main direct evidence is from a single witness. In assessing the credibility of the witness, Ferguson CJ and Maxwell P paid considerable attention to the demeanour of the witness. Weinberg J assessed the credibility of the witness not so much by how he said things, but by reference to its objective plausibility.  He was of view that it was simply unlikely that the offences could have been committed in the manner described given the setting in which they allegedly occurred. The High Court was provided with the opportunity to clarify this tension.  It did so, by stating that in assessing the evidence the court must objectively consider how improbable it is that the evidence is incorrect.  Thus, the High Court noted that it was not reasonable to find that Pell had the opportunity to commit the alleged offences given ""his practice of greeting congregants on or near the Cathedral steps after Sunday solemn Mass"". The High Court gave three reasons for this:  (i) his practice of greeting congregants on or near the Cathedral steps after Sunday solemn Mass. (ii) the established and historical Catholic church practice that required Cardinal Pell as an archbishop, always to be accompanied when robed in the Cathedral; and  (iii) the continuous traffic in and out of the priests' sacristy for ten to 15 minutes after the conclusion of the procession. Importantly, the High Court did not suggest that the witness was dishonest or unreliable.  Rather, it is the case that in criminal proceedings the prosecution has to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt and it is difficult to reach this threshold when there is evidence suggesting that the complainant's evidence may not be plausible given objective constraints associated with the narrative.   The Cardinal Pell judgement is one of the most polarising decisions in Australia's history. It has been handed down following the royal commission into child sexual abuse and the many deeply disturbing accounts of the sexual abuse of children which formed part of the inquiry.  The work of the royal commission has made incredible progress in putting in place processes for victims of child sexual abuse to secure justice against perpetrators and organisations responsible for such acts. The royal commission in particular highlighted the difficulties that victims of sexual abuse have in reporting offences against them. The institutional obstacles they confront in having their legal claims acted upon, and the immense suffering that they experience — often lasting a lifetime. The High Court's decision logically does not undermine any of these matters.  Many victims of child sexual abuse may feel that in acquitting Pell the High Court is inferring that reasonable doubt exists for many of those seeking justice for abuse committed against them. But it is important to understand that the High Court's decision is about one case — Pell vs The Queen — and its decision logically does not undermine any other case.

13,/news/2020-04-07/george-pell-appeal-vatican-christian-response/12130182?section=analysis,George Pell's successful appeal was a clear result in a case that cut the nation to the core,"""I hold no ill will toward my accuser, I do not want my acquittal to add to the hurt and bitterness so many feel; there is certainly hurt and bitterness enough."" Cardinal Pell's words on Tuesday, from his press statement. Words touching upon a world of pain reaching across generations of Australians. Conscious of lives forever changed. Aware of lives damaged. Knowing lives had been destroyed by clerical sexual abuse and cover-up. But also, aware the Highest court in the land has quashed his conviction.   The Pell matter has had a visceral quality about it. Whatever the High Court had decided, someone would be anxious and hurt. What of the prisoner? What of the alleged victim who told his story? We know there is a genuine need to listen to victims and to hear their stories. But the Pell case has also become a focus for the suffering of so many people who identify their own personal experiences and feelings with the Cardinal and his public role. The High Court quashed the verdict, though it had a number of ways it could have responded. It did not decide to instruct the Appeal Court judges to reconsider the evidence. It did not decide to order a retrial. It quashed the verdict. And that is a very clear result.   Parts of social media have exploded with outrage at the verdict, but this is the highest court in the land. It is a unanimous verdict. After 405 days in custody. In psychology, there is a thing called ""transference"". It is a process where a person redirects some of their feelings or desires for another person to an entirely different person. It's not intentional, it's just a thing that happens sometimes. There are elements of transference in the public discussion around Cardinal Pell and this case. Whatever you may think of him, he has become a lightning rod for the deep hurt and anger surrounding clerical sexual abuse. Yes, he is the cardinal. Yes, he was Australia's most powerful Catholic cleric. Yes, he had responsibility for dealing with sexual abuse. And yes, the Court says he is acquitted of these charges. Back when the Cardinal was sent to jail, there was shock and anguish among those who believed in his innocence. Tears were shed. Such people were accused of being unable to admit the facts. They went quiet for the most part — telling me they were afraid of the public mood. Public mood is a complex beast. But it is also one of the keys to putting this whole matter in some perspective.   I saw anger about the Vatican not ""defrocking"" the Cardinal. People were angry he had not been laicised. The Vatican said it would wait until the legal processes had concluded before it would consider its next move. Even as a prisoner, George Pell remained a Cardinal elector, who has the right to elect the next pope. That continues until his 80th birthday on June 8, 2021. Should a papal election be needed before his birthday, he will have the right to vote. He may also be invited to take on other roles within the church of Rome, or elsewhere. Repairing the reputational damage he has suffered will be hard, but he has never been one to shy away from a challenge. I reckon one of the hardest things of all in this process has been any attempt to remain impartial, and to listen simply to evidence. Media reporting of his two trials had been suppressed. But since his (now quashed) conviction, significant parts of the media appeared to be prosecuting a case against the Cardinal. Other parts of media stridently defended his innocence, but they were minority voices. The debate over innocent or guilty was dismissed as an extension of the culture wars. Turns out it wasn't. Last Sunday was Palm Sunday. Among many Christians, it is remembered as the day when Christ entered Jerusalem and was acclaimed as a king by the crowds. These same crowds would turn on him later in the week and call for his death. That Palm Sunday story cautions Christians about how behaviour in groups of people can change — suddenly and threateningly. It is taken as a warning about how we ourselves can behave. It is a warning about impartiality. And justice. Editor's note: A previous version of this article said the High Court said Cardinal Pell was innocent of the charges. It has been updated to say the High Court acquitted him of the charges.",By Noel Debien,"April 07, 2020"
14,/news/2020-04-07/george-pell-appeal-jury-system/12129940?section=analysis,Why was George Pell's appeal successful when our justice system values jury verdicts?,"The High Court today quashed the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, who had originally been found guilty on a number of charges by a jury of 12 people. His defence counsel, Bret Walker SC, had argued before the High Court that the convictions in 2018 were unsound because it was not open to the jury to find Pell guilty beyond reasonable doubt. He argued to the High Court the ""sheer unlikelihood"" of events and times aligning in the way that had been put forth by the prosecution to the trial judge and jury. He argued the story of the complainant could not be credible. The High Court has now agreed. Remember that, prior to the verdict, a jury of a dozen men and women had deliberated for almost five days before returning their verdicts of guilty on all five charges. How is it that a jury's decision, after hearing all the evidence (with the exception of Pell himself) and deliberating for a considerable period of time, can be subverted by the opinion of an appeal court 16 months later?   To answer this question we need to look briefly at the appeal grounds that apply in the higher criminal courts. There are two broad grounds of appeal against conviction. Each is found in both the common law and legislation that pertains to these matters. The first, and far more common, is that there has been an error of law (or fact) in the way that the trial has been conducted, the way evidence has been wrongly admitted, or the way the judge has incorrectly summed up to the jury. The less common basis of appeal is the verdict of the jury is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, given the evidence. The Pell appeal proceeded on this basis, and succeeded.   Appeal judges have traditionally shown a marked reluctance to overturn jury verdicts. The failed High Court appeal by Michael and Lindy Chamberlain in 1984 against their convictions for murdering their daughter comes quickly to mind. (They were later exonerated.) Judges of the High Court have long wrestled with the difficulty of subverting the important role of the jury. In 1997, then Chief Justice Gerard Brennan put the position thus: … the courts accept the jury as the possessor of both the skills and the advantages that are required to reach a proper verdict. In my respectful opinion, any contrary approach denies the importance of trial by jury and is inconsistent with the constitutional function which the jury performs. Nevertheless, there may be exceptional cases where it appears that, despite its skills and advantages and the due observance of all relevant rules of law and procedure, the jury must have fallen into error. There has long been a tradition of upholding the existence of the jury as the fundamental underpinning of the value, strength and reliability of our system of criminal justice. I have always thought this a slightly odd observation given that magistrates, not juries, determine the vast majority of criminal cases that arrive for trial in Australia's courts. But in the higher courts judgment by one's peers has always been a bulwark against the idea of a star chamber where decisions about an accused person's guilt or innocence are made unfairly and capriciously. The stability of the jury as an integral part of the justice system has never been seriously questioned. Advocates for the retention of the jury often recite the well-known case of Bushell in England in 1670 when two Quakers, William Penn and William Mead, were arrested and charged with unlawful assembly. The jury stood steadfastly against the wishes of the judge who wanted to convict the two preachers. The judge was ultimately rebuffed. The jury was vindicated and its place in the criminal justice process was cemented.   But in cases such as Pell, the High Court has reinforced the notion that, despite the jury having the primary responsibility of determining the guilt or innocence of a person on trial, its responsibility can be subject to a higher order. This is because, ultimately, the appeal courts have been given an overriding responsibility of determining for themselves whether a jury decision is a safe decision that has not been infected with the hue and cry or matters outside the evidence that was put to them. Whatever one may think of the Pell decision, it is appropriate there be such a final arbiter in the justice process. But one victim of this appeal result may be a loss of public confidence in the jury system. At the other end of the spectrum, others may lose confidence in the justice system itself. I trust that neither is the outcome. But one could be excused for feeling a general uneasiness about the fact that, for all the store we place on juries in determining issues of guilt and innocence, their role can be dispensed with so easily.

15,/news/2020-04-07/boris-johnson-coronavirus-hospital-uk-leadership/12127854?section=analysis,Boris Johnson's battle with coronavirus begs the question: was the public told the truth?,"That the leader of one of the most powerful nations and largest economies in the world is now in intensive care with worsening symptoms of coronavirus is extraordinary.  Downing Street says Boris Johnson's condition worsened over the course of Monday afternoon, and his medical team advised that he be moved to ICU at St Thomas' Hospital in central London. That decision would not have been taken lightly. Downing Street had spent the past 10 days assuring the public that the Prime Minister was fit to govern and had ""mild"" symptoms of COVID-19.   The word ""mild"" was dropped in recent days. Just hours before he was admitted to intensive care, Downing Street was insisting Mr Johnson was still well enough to govern. But was he really?    The scepticism began to grow after Mr Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, an announcement that was made just after the Queen had completed her special address to the nation. By Monday, the questions came thick and fast during the daily coronavirus update that was led by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.   He was questioned repeatedly about whether the PM could continue to capably lead the country during a time of crisis while in hospital. Mr Raab refused to answer questions about tests and treatment, and on one occasion pointed to national security as a reason for no comment. He repeatedly said the British leader was in ""good spirits"". Then Mr Raab revealed he had not spoken to Mr Johnson since Saturday, one day before the Prime Minister was admitted to hospital, despite standing in for him on Monday's daily government coronavirus briefing.    That raised the suspicions of some of the most seasoned political journalists in the UK, including the BBC's Andrew Neil, who tweeted: ""Why has Mr Raab not spoken to PM since Saturday? Something not right here."" Sure enough, something was not right.    Hours later came the bombshell that Boris Johnson had been transferred to intensive care. A statement from Downing Street said the PM had asked Mr Raab to deputise for him ""where necessary"".     That means Mr Raab is now the interim head of government, because Boris Johnson is likely no longer fit enough to lead. He is not the deputy prime minister as it would be in Australia, but rather the First Secretary of State. Regardless, he can make decisions on Mr Johnson's behalf, including on security and the coronavirus response. Over the past 11 days, it's clear Downing Street went to extraordinary lengths to assure the people their leader was fine.  Even on Monday night, the message was that the move to ICU was precautionary —  Mr Johnson was not on a ventilator, and was conscious when he was moved there.  But the questions will come as to whether he was moved to hospital quickly enough, and whether the public was told the truth of his condition.    Medical experts have regularly pointed to a deterioration among some patients at the 10-day mark of the virus. Others, like Health Secretary Matt Hancock, seem to sail through with little drama. Mr Hancock was diagnosed at the same time as Mr Johnson. He is 14 years younger than the British leader, and returned to work and started fronting press conferences days ago.    Since then, Mr Hancock has been front of the campaign to urge people to stay home as the weather in the UK improves after a long winter.  Mr Johnson's turn for the worse will likely focus the minds of those who have perhaps been taking the threat too lightly.  For now, his battle is a very personal one.

With no end date in sight and no meaningful projections about when the curve will be sufficiently flat, we are left with guesstimates about the cost of lost media rights, memberships and sponsorships. Yet the desperate measures being proposed to defy the lockdown with early start-ups, and the hit lists of potential cost savings, provide a measure of sport's vulnerabilities and also its priorities. The idea of putting all the NRL players on an island is just the most unintentionally hilarious consequence of years of profligate spending by self-interested club warlords. More grim are the murmured threats by AFL and NRL clubs to axe their women's teams, something that betrays not only the depth of the financial crisis but the indifference of some toward the still-embryonic women's leagues. Making an AFLW or NRLW club the first victim of a flattened sports economy will no doubt play well with those observers who have moaned that women's football in various codes has been a financial drag on male competitions, those whose first response upon seeing an image of the crowd of 53,034 that attended the 2019 AFLW grand final at Adelaide Oval was: ""Yeah, but they didn't have to pay to get in.""   Presumably few such critics have been to a suburban ground on a weekend morning and watched the thousands of young girls now playing football, Australian rules, the two rugby codes and cricket — sports that were once virtually exclusive male domains.   They certainly have not been on the committee of a local club trying to find enough grounds and coaches to satisfy the demands of all the girls now wanting to play cricket or footy. Accordingly, they would not understand the profound change in the sports participation dynamic caused by the growth of new women's leagues, one best explained by the different ways boys and girls had previously been engaged by sports. Put simply, boys have usually played the various kinds of footy and cricket just because they did. Personally, growing up in a small rural town, participation was not so much a matter of choice as a rite of passage.   Changes in lifestyles, greater financial prosperity, advances in technology and a far broader choice of activities have changed the participation model greatly.   Yet that same entry-level rationale for those boys who do choose footy and cricket remains. Heroes and role models continue to inspire continued participation as players or spectators, and inform the goal of one day competing at the top level. But scratch the surface and boys mostly continue to play the various football codes and cricket, particularly, because boys always have. A similar dynamic has existed in what we might once have called ""girls sports"". Girls would play netball, basketball, tennis, softball and field hockey because that was what girls played and not necessarily because they saw top-flight players do it. A few played cricket, even fewer the various types of football because participation was not encouraged, and — in the case of rules that stopped involvement in football beyond early ages — was actively discouraged. Then came perhaps the greatest change in the history of Australian sport's participation, the institution of professional female cricket and football leagues — the WBBL, the W-League, AFLW, NRLW, Super W — along with improved promotion and better pay deals for the Australian women's cricket team and the Matildas. The timing of entry, financial commitment and visibility of sports forming women's leagues has varied. Football got a significant jump with mass junior female participation, while cricket led the way with increased pay. But the impact of these leagues and their stars at the grassroots level has been enormous because they have altered the participation dynamic.   Girls are not just playing the sports they always have, but are now constantly being shown they can play others. In this regard, it is not too far-fetched to suggest high-profile female stars — such as the Matildas' Sam Kerr, cricketer Ellyse Perry and the AFLW's Tayla Harris — are more important in driving participation in their sports than their better paid and more celebrated male contemporaries. Please do not misinterpret this. The female stars are demonstrably not more important in attracting the revenue sources that fund major leagues and professional teams, including media rights deals, sponsorship and gate attendance.   Women's leagues are for now mostly loss making. But when you consider the vast number of girls playing cricket and various kinds of footy, they are also loss leaders — investments that create a significant benefit beyond the cost itself. Several years ago the AFL produced a study that revealed participants who remained engaged in the game as players, umpires or volunteers beyond their teenage years were six times more likely to be lifelong consumers of the game.   They are the membership ticketholders, TV eyeballs, purchasers of merchandise and others who underpin the game's finances and who will continue to do so beyond the costly current pause. This is why AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has been quick to contradict those club bosses privately speculating about axing their women's programs, insisting all 14 AFLW clubs will survive. The sports which find a way to cut their diminished financial cloths and stay the course with women's leagues will be significant beneficiaries of their far-sighted approach. Those who blink will find the short-term savings come at the cost of the growth they will desperately need in an even more challenging market.  ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 07, 2020"

The 2020 American presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 3 and the question is whether Lincoln's reasoning still holds true amid the coronavirus crisis. History suggests that the answer is yes. The rules governing US presidential elections are set by federal law, Congress and the US Constitution. They were held during the American Civil War, both world wars and the Great Depression. Yet the coronavirus crisis has forced the presidential campaign to change in unprecedented ways.   Several primary elections have been postponed, mass political rallies have been cancelled, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders' debate was audience-free, and there has been a rapid shift to online campaigning. Trump, Biden and Sanders have been forced to reinvent their campaign strategies, messages, and tone almost overnight. There is simply no playbook for campaigns in a time of social distancing.   For Trump, a mainstay of his campaign (and presidency) has been holding rallies for his supporters. Trump understands entertainment politics like no other political figure in America, and feeds off the energy of his free-wheeling rallies. During the 2016 campaign he held over 300 rallies, and nearly 100 since his election. Used to fire up his base, mobilise his supporters, encourage voter turnout and energise the president, these rallies have brought thousands of supporters together in arenas all over the country. Throughout his term in office, whenever political troubles have appeared, his staff is quick to arrange a rally to provide Trump a venue to tout accomplishments, stoke grievances, re-direct the narrative, and keep the spotlight on himself. But with almost all of the United States under stay-at-home directives, there is no possibility of a rally, nor will there be for months. What happens when you take Trump's crowds away?  ""It's very bad for Trump to not have crowds,"" Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio has said.  ""And I think he knows it,""   If Trump's preferred venues have disappeared, so too has the main message of his re-election campaign.  Trump has argued his stewardship led to robust economic growth and extremely low unemployment. That message is now obsolete as the American economy heads towards a full-blown economic depression. Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs in a mere two weeks. The president seems to be testing a new message — portraying himself now as a wartime president, with an implicit argument that it's dangerous to change horses midstream. Trump is trying to use the daily White House briefings to shape his image as a wartime leader. American voters might buy Trump's argument that he alone can fix this, but it will be based on how well the administration handles this crisis as more Americans are confronted by the reality of the pandemic in their own communities.    The challenges are different for the Democrats. Despite Joe Biden's momentum at the primaries, the Democrats have still not formally selected a nominee to challenge Trump. Biden has a virtually insurmountable lead, but there is little to suggest Sanders has any intention of dropping out.  As more state primaries get postponed and the Democratic nominating convention is delayed, Democrats face the challenge of figuring out how to choose their candidate in the absence of the normal process.  More pressing for the Democratic party is the immediate need to reinvent campaigning during the pandemic. The party needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for advertising, generate enormous enthusiasm among the Democratic Party base to ensure voter turnout, and make the case to independents and wavering Trump supporters to switch to the Democratic candidate.  Biden, as the frontrunner, was just gearing up these efforts when the pandemic hit, bringing all of its efforts to an almost total halt.  Unable to count on fundraising events, campaign events, door-knocking, and essentially every other mainstay of the modern American presidential campaign, the campaign now has to find ways to try to replicate all of these essential functions — virtually.   And the campaigns are also certainly aware of the significant COVID-19 health risk to both Biden and Sanders, two men in their late-70s.   As the frontrunner, Biden's campaign also faces the challenge of trying to get out its message while practically all attention in the US is now directed at the local, state and federal response to the pandemic. Biden does have an advantage here — voters consistently rank him highly on his empathy and ability to connect.  He will also certainly be making the case that the US response is floundering because of the devaluation of experts in Trump administration, and the lack of proper staffing, planning and response capabilities. But the Biden campaign will have to carefully consider whether, and how, to attack Trump's response while presenting a better way forward.   As for the election in November, there are range of possible outcomes. One possibility is that a majority of Americans will be so traumatised by the unfolding horror of the coronavirus, that even an adequate response by Trump will offset Trump's initial failures and their pre-existing grievances, and vote to keep him in office. Yet there is another possibility that, as the coronavirus spreads, popular anger will grow at those deemed responsible for moving too slowly, downplaying risks, ignoring evidence, and allowing US stockpiles to dwindle to dangerously low levels. In that eventuality, Americans may back the Democratic argument that expertise is needed back in Washington. The drastic impact on the US economy — and how the government responds — will also be a significant factor in voters decisions.   For many, Trump's election in 2016 was seen as a black swan event — a hard to predict event that comes as a surprise and has a disproportionately large impact — on American politics and America's foreign policy.  But now we find ourselves in the midst of a real black swan event as COVID-19 sweeps the globe.  There is no question that American politics has been turned on its head.  The effects will be widespread, long-lasting, and utterly impossible to predict.

18,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-jacinda-ardern-leadership/12124300?section=analysis,Three reasons why Jacinda Ardern's coronavirus response has been a masterclass in crisis leadership,"Imagine, if you can, what it's like to make decisions on which the lives of tens of thousands of other people depend. If you get things wrong, or delay deciding, they die. Your decisions affect the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, resulting in huge economic disruption, mass layoffs and business closures. Imagine you must act quickly, without having complete certainty your decisions will achieve what you hope. Now imagine that turning your decisions into effective action depends on winning the support of people. Yes, you do have enforcement capacity at your disposal. But success or failure hinges on getting most people to choose to follow your leadership — even though it demands sudden, unsettling, unprecedented changes to their daily lives.   This is the harsh reality political leaders around the world have faced in responding to COVID-19. As someone who researches and teaches leadership — and has also worked in senior public sector roles under both National and Labour-led governments — I'd argue New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is giving most Western politicians a masterclass in crisis leadership. When it comes to assessing New Zealand's public health response, we should listen to epidemiologists like Professor Michael Baker. On Friday, Baker said New Zealand had the ""most decisive and strongest lockdown in the world at the moment"" — and that New Zealand is ""a huge standout as the only Western country that's got an elimination goal"" for COVID-19. But how can we assess Ardern's leadership in making such difficult decisions? A good place to start is with American professors Jacqueline and Milton Mayfield's research into effective leadership communication. The Mayfields' research-based model highlights ""direction-giving"", ""meaning-making"" and ""empathy"" as the three key things leaders must address to motivate followers to give their best. Being a public motivator is essential for leaders — but it's often done poorly. The Mayfields' research shows direction-giving is typically over-used, while the other two elements are under-used.   Ardern's response to COVID-19 uses all three approaches. In directing New Zealanders to ""stay home to save lives"", she simultaneously offers meaning and purpose to what we are being asked to do. In freely acknowledging the challenges we face in staying home — from disrupted family and work lives, to people unable to attend loved ones' funerals — she shows empathy about what is being asked of us. The March 23 press conference announcement of New Zealand's lockdown is a clear example of Ardern's skilful approach, comprising a carefully crafted speech, followed by extensive time for media questions.   In contrast, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pre-recorded his March 24 lockdown announcement, offering no chance for questions from the media, while framing the situation as an ""instruction"" from government, coupled with a strong emphasis on enforcement measures.   Where Ardern blended direction, care and meaning-making, Johnson largely sought ""compliance"". Ardern's approach also strongly reflects what well-known Harvard leadership scholar Professor Ronald Heifetz has long argued is vital — but also rare and difficult to accomplish — when leading people through change. Ardern has used daily televised briefings and regular Facebook live sessions to clearly frame the key questions and issues requiring attention.   Also consistent with Heifetz's teachings, she has regulated distress by developing a transparent framework for decision-making — the government's alert level framework — allowing people to make sense of what is happening and why. Importantly, that four-level alert framework was released and explained early, two days before a full lockdown was announced, in contrast with the prevarication and sometimes confusing messages from leaders in countries such as Australia and the UK.   The work of another leadership scholar, the UK's Professor Keith Grint, also sheds light on Ardern's leadership approach during this crisis. For Grint, leadership involves persuading the collective to take responsibility for collective problems. Much of the prime minister's public commentary has been dedicated to exactly that — and it's been overwhelmingly effective, at least so far, with a recent poll showing 80 per cent support for the government's response to COVID-19.   Grint also argues that when dealing with ""wicked problems"" — which are complex, contentious and not easily resolved — leaders must ask difficult questions that disrupt established ways of thinking and acting. It's clear this has happened in New Zealand, as shown in the suite of initiatives the Government has taken to respond to the pandemic, including its decision to move to a national lockdown relatively fast compared to many — though not all — countries. Of course, not everything has been perfect in New Zealand's or Ardern's COVID-19 response. Ongoing, independent scrutiny of the government's response is essential. But as my own research has argued, expecting perfection of leaders, especially in such difficult circumstances, is a fool's errand. It's never possible. Nor should we allow the ""perfect"" to become the enemy of the ""good"" when speed and enormous complexity are such significant features of the decision-making context. Whether you're comparing Ardern's performance against other Western leaders, or assessing her efforts using researchers' measures of leadership excellence, as a New Zealander I think there is much to be grateful for in how she is leading us through this crisis.

19,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-law-class-action-negligence/12113220?section=analysis,Coronavirus could spark legal action by the families of those who have died,"The health and economic devastation caused by the coronavirus is unmistakable and the legal fallout from the contagion could also be severe — resulting in the largest negligence class action in Australia's history. The pattern of infections from other countries suggests that tens of thousands of Australians could be infected with COVID-19. And while the science on beating the coronavirus has not changed (break the chain of infection), the continually changing Government position could be legally problematic.   The mortality rate of the illness worldwide is on average over 4 per cent, although in Australia it is currently less than 1 per cent and in Spain more than 9 per cent.  Who bears the responsibility for these deaths? This question will become more urgent once statistical and hypothetical deaths translate into identifiable people — all with relatives, aggrieved that the lives of their loved ones have been cut short. In Austria, a legal precedent is already being tested. About 2,500 skiers have so far joined a class action lawsuit over the way authorities managed a coronavirus outbreak at a resort in the province of Tyrol.  The lawsuit alleges authorities acted with ""negligent endangerment"" for failing to protect skiers from the outbreak. Hundreds of Europe's first cases of coronavirus have been traced to the resort at Ischgl.   The legal fallout from the pandemic is likely to be immense.  Apart from Government organisations — which are not immune from legal liability — all individuals and institutions have a duty of care to take reasonable steps to not transmit the coronavirus. This could have considerable implications for institutions such as medical facilities if they do not provide proper protective equipment for staff, cruise ship operators and even people who are infected and wantonly ignore social-distancing protocols.   A class action has already been proposed against the operators of the Ruby Princess, which is the source of seven Australian deaths from coronavirus. A duty of care, whether it be by a business, individual or government, will have been breached where there is a failure to take reasonable steps to avoid harm that was reasonably foreseeable. The nature of the precautions that are necessary is commensurate with the severity of the risk and governments are liable for their omissions as well as their actions. Because the coronavirus outbreak is a freak occurrence there is no well-defined protocol for best-case practice. However, there is a clear legal methodology for responding to risk and the key determinant is the severity of the risk if it eventuates.   Shortly after the first confirmed coronavirus case hit Australian shores on January 25, there was clear scientific information that established the nature of infection. This included its severity, its pattern of spread and means of control. In particular, it was known that the only mechanism to reduce the spread of the virus was to break the chain of infection. This could only be achieved by considerably limiting human contact. Against this background, the Australian approach of business as usual (plus hand washing) until a critical number of infections occurred — and then going into incremental lock down — is likely to be carefully scrutinised by future courts. Given that it was likely that business as usual would lead to a growth in infections, the most cautious approach would have been to immediately put in place clear interventions to stop the chain of infection. Prevention is better than cure.    This principle applies much more strongly in situations such as the coronavirus as there are no conceivable counterarguments to the premise that ""prevention is better than non-cure"". This is the philosophy adopted by New Zealand which went into near total lockdown a week ago when it had fewer than 500 infections. The main potential legal problem associated with the Australian approach stems from shifting behavioural restrictions imposed on Australians. In the space of just over three weeks the government has gone from stating that mass sporting events are acceptable, to limiting gatherings to 500 people, then 100, then 10 and now two (plus a 1.5 metre zone of separation). This does not have the hallmarks of a methodology, science-based approach to the crisis. The reality is that the science on how to control the virus is unchangeable — break the chain of causation. Instead the approach seems reactionary: an attempt to catch up to a contagion that was let to run freely (and perhaps too freely) at the outset.   I suspect that the reason for this is that the government attempted to balance economic considerations against health objectives, and hence permitted trade and commerce to flow for as long as possible. It is clear that future courts will not seriously entertain an economic justification for a failure to do everything reasonably possible to curtail the greatest public health threat in many decades. A stricter risk mitigation approach (shut down travel six weeks ago — as some states have done recently and forcibly quarantine every confirmed coronavirus case) would almost certainly see Australia with fewer cases.   The approach by Australian governments in dealing with the virus is in stark contrast to not only that in New Zealand but also Singapore, which is also a nation island but one which is far more densely populated than Australia.  Singapore had its first reported case of coronavirus two days before Australia. It now has less than a fifth of the number cases as we do. Rather than encouraging the community to go about business as usual once the virus was detected, the Singaporean government implemented concrete measures to reduce the spread the virus within three days of its detection in that country. Extensive efforts were made to identify, isolate and monitor all positive cases and people with whom they had contact. Mass gatherings were quickly halted. Schools remain open but students have daily temperature screenings.   One aspect of the government's approach that is likely to be scrutinised very carefully by future courts is the lack of enforcement of self-isolation measures. While people diagnosed with coronavirus have been told to self-isolate since the first cases were diagnosed, the concept of self-isolation was initially not even defined and it is only recently that it has been enforced. Prior to that, people with coronavirus were permitted to freely go about their daily activities.   Relying on the goodwill of citizens to do the right thing as part of a solution to a crisis is always a losing strategy — this is underlined by the behaviour of many supermarket shoppers in recent weeks. Whether the financial pain of this crisis will be compounded will almost certainly be determined by future courts.  To this end, hindsight will inevitably play an important role in evaluating the appropriateness of the Government's response. The fact that the rate of increase in new infections has dropped significantly and finally governments are coercively enforcing self-isolation will be powerful considerations in support of the current approach. The question that future courts will need to determine is whether it was too little too late.

21,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478,One coronavirus number will let us know if Australia's outbreak is getting worse,"The vast array of data on the coronavirus pandemic can feel overwhelming, as we all try to make sense of how fast COVID-19 is spreading around the world and the relentless daily count of new cases and deaths. Helpfully, there's one number that can tell us quickly and clearly whether the coronavirus outbreak is getting better or worse. It's called the growth factor. The main thing to understand is this — to be sure we're staying on top of the outbreak, we must keep this number below one. And here is how the growth factor for Australia's outbreak currently looks.   Put simply, the growth factor measures how fast the number of new cases is going up or down. And here's the key point: Calculating the daily growth factor is as simple as taking today's new reported cases and dividing it by yesterday's new cases. Because these numbers can be a little volatile, we're using a five-day moving average of new cases for our calculations.   Of course, the growth factor will change over time. Even though Australia's current growth factor is below one — meaning there were fewer new cases today than there were yesterday — that could change. But for now at least, things are headed in the right direction. Australia looks to be successfully flattening the curve but as public health officials keep reminding us, the fight against coronavirus is likely to be a long one. Even if the number of people sick with COVID-19 gets quite low, the virus could start spreading quickly again without ongoing vigilance. [Want to see how Australia's growth factor compares to the US, the UK and other countries around the world? Keep reading, or skip ahead.] A figure like this is only ever as good as the data being collected. So when reading the growth factor, there are two extra parameters to keep in mind: community transmission and testing. The number of coronavirus cases originating overseas is starting to decrease drastically at the moment, and there's a risk those falling numbers could hide something more worrying — a smaller but rising number of cases caused by spread by community transmission. Experts say the rate of that local spread may be a better indicator of just how well our physical distancing measures are working. It's been difficult to compile data on community transmission. So far, the data we do have only starts in April. It shows little difference in the growth factors for imported cases and local spread. However, there are about 89 cases still 'under investigation', meaning their origin remains unclear.   Another question mark around the data is testing. We will only find cases where we look for them and much of Australia's testing has been focused on people arriving from overseas and their close contacts. Even though Australia has tested a high proportion of the population by international standards, Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says our high testing rate and low positive rate are a ""red herring"".   ""If you're not testing the increasing number of people with symptoms in the community, then you only see what you test for. ""If we can look at that in more detail as we do the breakdown [of community transmission] within Australia I think that's going to be helpful, because I do think it ties to the lockdown. The lockdown is all about community acquisition, not about the boats that came in four weeks ago."" The unknown number of undetected cases currently in the community may prove crucial to keeping Australia's outbreak manageable. Several states have announced they're now expanding testing criteria to include a broader cross-section of the community. So it's important to remember that any rise in the growth factor could be, in part, a result of more widespread testing. ""As we expand our testing we expect it to go up but that doesn't necessarily mean community cases are going up, it means that testing is broadening to capture them,"" Professor Bennett said. Finally, it's worth remembering that even though the growth factor is a great litmus test for how well we're keeping Australia's outbreak in check, other numbers are important too. Now that we understand what growth factor means, it can also provide a useful insight into outbreaks around the world — and how different countries are faring in their efforts to bring coronavirus under control. The following charts focus on the countries with the largest overall coronavirus outbreaks around the world, as well as some of Australia's nearest neighbours.             As you compare those global figures, it’s even more important to factor testing regimes into your thinking. If one country is testing a lot and another is testing very little, it’s going to have a major impact on how their growth factors stack up.

22,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
23,/news/2020-04-10/australians-pool-cash-for-coronavirus-flights-out-of-india/12138010,"As coronavirus cases escalate in India, Australians pool their cash to arrange charter flights home","A group of expats and aviation experts have banded together to organise private charter flights to bring home hundreds of Australians stranded in India.   Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the Government for emergency flights.  ""I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,"" Mr Quinn told the ABC. ""People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.""   Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle.   ""But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,"" he said.  India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases.   ""People assume [Australians] hadn't heeded the calls from home,"" Mr Quinn said. ""The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn't."" As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts.  He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation.   Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" Mr Hempel said.   ""I know it's a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. ""I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out."" The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out.    ""[We're] elated, absolutely stoked,"" Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room.   ""We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare."" The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. ""We were nervous that it still wasn't real until we were literally in the car,"" Mr Munro said.   ""When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.""  Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through.  ""I think it should not have been their responsibility,"" he added.  Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx.   Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India's lockdown.   On April 9, Ms Payne said she had spoken with her Indian counterpart about organising a commercial flight to Australia. ""People think it's quite simple that you order charter flights,"" Mr Quinn said. ""But what people don't really understand [is] there's a lot of complex issues that Australia faced that other countries didn't."" The Australian Government has stopped short of ""endorsing"" the private charter flights, stating government officials and contractors have been instructed to not fly Lion Air until an investigation in a 2018 fatal crash is complete.   But Mr Hempel said he personally had no safety concerns about the airline. ""They're a large airline,"" Mr Hempel said. ""In this case, they've been extremely helpful and at the end of the day they're scrutinised by the [International Civil Aviation Organisation] and the same levels of organisation that Australian airliners are.""

Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings. NSW drivers could spend six months in prison, or be forced to pay $11,000 plus $5,500 per day if they continue to break the rules.

26,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
27,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-political-debate-turns-to-a-way-out/12140416,Coronavirus political debate turns to a way out while we endure Easter in a virtual monastery,"Remember how last year's Easter felt bizarre because the country was in election mode? How normal that seems, now everything is surreal, with the nation ""holidaying"" in this peculiar, unpleasant limbo. As we contemplate the grimness we should also remember it could be much worse.  It's early days but we've dodged the horror of Italy, France, Britain, and the US. So far in Australia, the virus is being contained, the ""curve"" of new cases flattened.   Nevertheless, this Easter millions of Australians see little but uncertainty ahead, as they worry about their health, their jobs or lack or them, their businesses. The economic fear inevitably remains dialled high despite a trimmed-down Parliament (only 50-plus House of Representatives MPs out of 151) on Wednesday passing the government's $130 billion wage subsidy package.   Earlier in the week, Scott Morrison had received a Newspoll bounce in his approval, just as Kevin Rudd did in the global financial crisis. Bad as the GFC was, it's clear this crisis will be much more fraught to exit. We are only just into the restrictions but already the debate is intensifying about how and when we get out of them — a result of the relatively good news and people's natural impatience. The question occupying cooped-up households, half-dead businesses, and anxious governments (and their health advisers) is: what now? The immediate answer is simple. We need to endure Easter in a virtual monastery.  When Health Minister Greg Hunt says ""this in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus"", it is likely only a minor exaggeration. The longer term answer to ""what now"" will involve practical and ethical judgements, and contested views.     The exit strategy is uppermost in Morrison's mind — he has always bracketed ""livelihoods"" (aka the economy) with ""lives"" in his language. We're not going to jump from where we are now to that ""other side"" he and others talk about.  We will walk on a long perilous journey requiring complex decisions about steps and timing, with the risk of serious mistakes, and the certainty of pain. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says: ""We are on a life raft. We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.""  The national cabinet has asked its health experts for navigational advice. But the issue always comes back to the health-economics balance. The much-anticipated modelling the government has released didn't provide much of a compass. It told us the obvious: if we'd let the epidemic rip — which we were never going to — the health system would have been overwhelmed. The present policy is one of ""suppressing"" the virus — isolating cases, tracking contacts. Morrison believes it would be too costly to aim to eliminate COVID-19 here — the New Zealand route.   So the future choice is between attempted continued containment until there is a vaccine — a big operation in testing and tracing — or pursuing some form of ""herd immunity"".  The latter would allow the virus to move through the community (while protecting the most vulnerable).   The herd immunity path (there'd be a nicer name) would be very controversial and take more lives than attempting to maintain the suppression approach. Asked on Thursday whether it was possible, when we do unwind the various restrictions, to simultaneously pursue a suppression policy, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said: ""It's entirely possible, and that would need to be the aim. … The suppression strategy needs to be sustainable in the medium term whilst we work out things like when a vaccine becomes available, whilst we bring new molecules online to be able to treat the virus."" What is important as discussion gets underway about lifting some restrictions is that we get transparency on the health advice. This is being promised, but it's no good having modelling long after decisions are made.   There has been more than a dash of ""we know best"" in how the Government has explained things so far.  ""We're acting on medical advice"", it has said, to justify this or that measure.  But the official health advice has sometimes appeared less than consistent, and been criticised by some experts. Morrison has canvassed easing restrictions on a patchwork basis, first in places where and when it seems safest to do so. Those places would in effect be trials for elsewhere. This is logical but won't be easy.  If combined with the continuation of the suppression policy, governments must be willing to reimpose controls if case numbers increase again. And strict health protocols should be in place for how businesses and organisations deal with fresh cases. A present challenge is to manage the pressures from stakeholders and the community for an easing timetable. Innes Willox, chief of the Australian Industry Group, wrote this week in The Australian: ""We need a path back to getting the economy going again. … Businesses owners and their backers will quickly change direction, make other arrangements or move on if they don't have some hope or sense that the current restrictions aren't limitless.""   After an initial period when anyone who criticised the Government was likely to be attacked for betraying ""Team Australia"", a degree of political normality is returning, at a muted level.  Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

28,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-restrictions-fines-disobey-the-law-your-rights/12140644,Coronavirus restrictions mean on-the-spot fines if you disobey the law. These are your rights,"The message to everyone during the coronavirus pandemic is to stay at home and only leave if you really need to for, say, food, health care or exercise. Police now have powers to issue on-the-spot fines to people for breaches of public health orders as part of the coronavirus restrictions. Hundreds of fines have already been issued in many states, for example: Victorian police also pulled over and fined a 17-year-old learner driver for ""non-essential travel"", but later withdrew the fine. This last case shows penalty notices can be overturned. So, what should you do if you have been issued with a notice by police, especially if you think you have been unfairly fined?   Penalty notice schemes allow police to swiftly impose a fixed fine and avoid prosecuting the matter in court. Police and politicians tend to describe their benefit as reducing red tape and cutting costs. But many Australians are unaware of their rights and options if they receive a penalty notice. The following information is not intended to replace independent legal advice. You should also check your state or territory's rules and procedures.   Check the notice for the payment due date.  If you are experiencing financial hardship and cannot pay the fine, contact the fines administration agency to see if you can request an extension or ask to pay by instalments.     The directions of some COVID-19 orders are vague and have been hastily drafted. Many Australians are struggling to keep up with what's allowed and what isn't. Police have also had insufficient time and training to understand the orders, including what constitutes a reasonable excuse. This can give rise to arbitrary — and perhaps incorrect — interpretations of the provisions. You can request an independent review of the police officer's decision to issue a penalty notice. The request should be directed to the relevant fines administration agency before the penalty due date.   If successful, your penalty notice may be withdrawn or you could receive a caution in place of the fine. Grounds for a review may include: Review processes often allow you to provide copies of evidence to support your claim, such as photos and documents. If you disagree with the findings of the independent reviewer you can elect to go to court. A court may find you guilty or not guilty. If convicted of the offence, you may be liable for a larger fine and imprisonment for up to six months. You should seek legal advice if you intend to go to court. The right to seek an independent review or go to court is rarely exercised. As the NSW Law Reform Commission observed in 2012: The penalty notice system does not have the transparency normally associated with justice systems in democratic societies … Most people simply pay the penalty. Only 1 per cent elect to go to court, so that the guilt or innocence of the recipient is rarely scrutinised. If you don't pay the fine by the due date, you will usually be given a reminder notice and may incur additional financial penalties. If you still do not pay the fine by the extended due date, you may receive fines enforcement sanctions, including driver licence or vehicle registration suspension or cancellation, or property seizure.   In the rush to quickly enforce social distancing and social isolation rules, the flaws of on-the-spot fines regimes have received little attention. They do not punish everyone equally. A wealthy person is much less likely to feel the weight of a $1,000 fine — and suffer the consequences of fines enforcement sanctions — than someone who is unemployed or has had their income drastically reduced.   There is also insufficient evidence of the deterrent effect of penalty notices, particularly on those who do not understand the law or what they did wrong, those who are too poor to pay the fine or, alternatively, those who are so wealthy that the fine has a negligible impact. An important aspect of the rule of law is that citizens are made aware of the law so they can moderate their behaviour to comply with it. The speed at which the COVID-19 orders have been introduced, their breadth and their arbitrary interpretation by individual police officers can result in people unwittingly breaching the law and being unfairly punished.

29,/news/2020-04-10/gardening-australia-costa-georgiadis-tips-for-covid-19-isolation/12132902,Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis shares four tips for living in coronavirus isolation,"Costa Georgiadis's chooks are pretty happy right now. Like the rest of Australia, the gardening guru is spending a lot more time at home and, unsurprisingly, in his backyard. ""They're spending a lot more time in the broader garden and actually out on the street as I do work on my street garden,"" he said. ""Their definition of lockdown is free range."" These are troubling times, but for Costa there is ""a big silver lining"", and that's seeing how many people are getting back into their gardens.   So to help you make the most of it, Costa has some ideas on everything from what to plant now to how many chooks you can have (if you can find them), and what to do if you live in an apartment. First of all, Costa wants you to just take a moment to get to know your garden.   ""It's really such a special time in the sense that without the pressures of having to go anywhere, there's this chance to slow down,"" he said. ""One of the smallest and simplest things from a gardening point of view is to actually go out into your garden and just observe what's going on."" It might sound basic, but Costa says most of the time we're just moving through the space — taking the bins out or watering the plants while staring at our phones. So he wants you to try these simple ideas: In other words, look at your garden as a living thing, rather than just a space. ""I talk to children about doing that, but I equally share it with adults because there's so much going on in our gardens that we tend to miss,"" Costa said. There are a lot of things that can go into the ground at the moment. The typically cooler parts of the country haven't yet become too cold, and the hotter northern areas are now starting to become more mild. ""So there's this wonderful, almost spring window,"" Costa said.  ""As far as gardening goes and growing, this is one of the prime slots similar to when we come out in in early spring."" Here are a few options to plant now:   Some of these are quick turnaround and you will be able to start ""repeat havesting"" within 30-50 days. That is, picking off outer leaves and leaving the rest to continue growing. Then you can turn to longer-term vegetables like snow peas, broad beans, broccoli and cauliflower.  ""There's things that we can wait for the full term and there's other things that we can harvest along the way, and those salad greens are a great place to start,"" Costa said. A lack of space doesn't have to mean a lack of garden, and there is still plenty you can grow. Just get experimental, Costa says.   ""Get your celery or your spinach or even your Asian greens, cut them off from the base with about two centimetres or so, then put them on the window sill in a little bit of water,"" he said. ""Things like spring onions — and I've got it going on at the moment with some silverbeet — they'll reshoot and you can literally watch them start growing from the central core. ""Then once they get up a bit and you see little roots you can go out and plant them into the soil and it's just a nice little project."" Other things you can grow in jars on your window sill include mung beans and lentils. Costa says there's no shortage of online tutorials for sprouts. ""That's a great little science project for the kids.""   Costa's chooks like a bit of gardening themselves, especially when he tries to put the mulch out. ""They didn't go to the school of colouring in between the lines, they spread the mulch outside the garden beds,"" he said. ""But hey, they're happy.""   If you're looking to buy some chickens, chances are you're not alone. At the same time there was a run on toilet paper, chicken breeders around the country were also being inundated. If you do want to get some chooks consider how you will keep them. ""You can have a pre-made coop and some of them come on wheels, so you can actually move them across the yard so that they're not fixed in one point,"" Costa said.   In terms of space, Costa says a smaller coop is OK as long as the chickens have space they can be let out to roam around in. About 10 square metres is a good guide. ""That would be enough to have a couple of chickens, and it's always nice to have two rather than one so they've got some company,"" he said.    ",ABC News Breakfast,"April 10, 2020"
30,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-claiming-tax-rent-mortgage/12135048,Coronavirus is changing how we claim tax this year. But what about rent or mortgage?,"If your office is now at home, you may be wondering: does this mean I can claim my rent or mortgage at tax time? In an effort to get you through uncharted waters, we recently published this piece on what you can claim when working from home. With many of us now sharing our work space with our kids, our cats and our dirty dishes, the ATO has introduced a new, simpler method for people to make claims at tax time. It's an 80-cents-per-hour method, which includes all running expenses like the phone, power bills, heating and cooling. But many of you sent through some questions about particular household items. You were worried that if you claimed any home office expenses now that you might have to pay more tax when it comes time to sell your property. So we went back to our experts to find out.   So now that your work space and living space has combined, can you also claim your rent or the interest on your mortgage? Well, it's complicated. But in general, no.   That's because in most cases, your house isn't the main office, studio or place of business, says Andrew Gardiner, spokesperson for the National Tax and Accountants' Association. ""This is the case even though you might be highly encouraged or forced to work from home when dealing with the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. The main exception is if you legitimately run your small business from a dedicated space in your home or your employer does not provide you with an office or work station at their business premises. ""The classic example would be someone who runs a hairdressing salon out of part of their house and they have it dedicated for that purpose,"" Mr Gardiner said. But even then, you can't claim your total rent or the full amount of your interest on your mortgage. You can still only claim a portion, worked out by calculating the floor area of the business space compared to the total property size. Many people sent questions into us, worried that if they made any home office claims, they might get a sting in the tail when it comes time to sell their home — meaning they might have to pay capital gains tax.   Capital gains tax is basically a tax that you pay to the Government when you make a profit on an investment — usually a property or shares. You don't usually have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the home that you live in — it's called the main residence exemption. Fortunately, even if you make claims for home office expenses like the internet, phone, heating and cooling, you won't have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the family home, tax accountant Paula Hart says. ""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat. But, of course, if you're still confused, make sure you check with your accountant.     This article contains general information only. It should not be relied on as financial advice. If you need individual tax advice please see an accountant. Are you a woman who needs help to manage your money?

31,/news/2020-04-10/south-australia-concern-people-travel-despite-coronavirus-rules/12140466,Holidaymakers continuing to travel despite coronavirus advice ahead of Easter,"Residents on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula have expressed dismay at the number of holidaymakers continuing to arrive in coastal towns, despite advice not to travel this Easter.   Authorities including the Premier and the Police Commissioner have repeatedly urged people to cancel their long weekend travel plans and not to take unnecessary journeys, to protect the community from the spread of coronavirus. ""This Easter, this school holidays, travel around this state is completely and utterly off. We do not want people heading out,"" Premier Steven Marshall said on Sunday. However, Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns including Port Elliott and Victor Harbor, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, have noticed a rise in travellers.   She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had begun arriving in recent weeks, and the local population was still continuing to swell. ""We've got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we're very concerned,"" Ms Green said. ""Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing — the locals have been talking [about this] on social media."" Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town yesterday, despite the fact local accommodation was closed.   She said while some of them were ratepayers who owned holiday houses in the area, she urged anyone who did not need to be in the area to stay away. ""The shops are just packed and no-one's taking the social-distancing rules into consideration, and it's not fair to us,"" she said. ""It's a bit concerning because we've got such an elderly population here, it's one of the high risk areas. ""We want you to come but just not at the moment.""   Coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in South Australia and there have been 421 confirmed cases. ""At the locations people tend to holiday we'll be out in force. We'll have police horses, we'll be using the police helicopter, the police plane, and also drones to monitor areas where we believe crowds are likely to gather,"" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. ""We've also been in touch with most holiday camps and caravan parks. ""People are not welcome in those areas and some shops are refusing to serve people who do not reside in those areas."" Extra police will monitor border control points, ""limiting the opportunity for people to visit those well-known holiday areas"".   Police yesterday confirmed eleven people had been fined after a house party in Port Augusta on Tuesday night, after the group repeatedly ignored directives from officers. ""The crowd were forcibly dispersed,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""We are prepared to show some tolerance … but where this is a blatant disregard for those warnings, we will take action.""     The Commissioner also warned people who spit or deliberately cough to scare others on public transport could be committing an offence. It follows anecdotal reports of people intentionally coughing near drivers or other passengers to cause distress. ""Any action like that, that is done to cause fear of infection may well constitute a criminal offence,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""If those matters are reported and we're able to identify those people we will take action. This is an abhorrent act.""      ",,"April 10, 2020"

Police are out in force, slapping fines on anyone found to be breaching the rules on physical distancing and non-essential travel. In Tasmania, the Premier warned there would be ""eyes in the sky"". That includes NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin, who has now been fined $1,000 for going to his beach house. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's rate of new infections was only dropping because people had been observing physical-distancing rules. ""It's important because we cannot undo the tremendous progress we have made together in recent times. So this Easter we are staying at home. Don't travel. Don't go away,"" he said. Two more deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed today, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales, taking the national toll to 53. A man who allegedly spat at a Brisbane nurse has been charged with serious assault of a public officer. Police said the incident happened at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's fever clinic on Wednesday. In New South Wales, police will be able to issue $5,000 on-the-spot fines from today for spitting or coughing on emergency service workers or employees going about their duties in a hospital or pharmacy. ""If you had said some time ago, when this crisis started, that people would go out and cough and spit on emergency service workers and people working in pharmacies and hospitals, I would have thought that was remote,"" NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said. ""But we already have seen this sort of activity."" The change under the Public Health Regulation 2012 was signed yesterday after an ""urgent"" request from NSW Health and representatives from unions for healthcare services and police.   The number of deaths in the state of New York has risen by 799, a record high for a third straight day. Meanwhile, New York City increased burial operations on Hart Island, an island where unknown and homeless people are buried, as it deals with dwindling morgue space. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said social distancing was working, and the latest death count reflected the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The number of patients newly admitted to hospital in the state dropped for a second day, to 200. Mr Cuomo said that was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"". New York has now recorded more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19, or nearly half of the total across the country. A University of Washington model often cited by US and state officials projects that COVID-19 will claim 60,415 American lives by August 4, with the peak coming on Easter Sunday. More than 450,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far.   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is now out of intensive care, where he was being treated for COVID-19. The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ""in good spirits"", but he remained in hospital and would continue to be closely monitored. The news came as Britain recorded a slightly lower daily death toll from the virus, with 881 people losing their lives. The day prior, the figure was 938. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Mr Johnson, said the UK had not reached the peak of its coronavirus crisis and it was too early too lift its lockdown. UK officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Mr Raab led a nationwide show of appreciation for health service workers, with people across Britain giving a round of applause — many from their front doors and windows — for the National Health Service as part of the #ClapForCarers campaign. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the UK has recorded 65,863 cases of coronavirus and 7,992 deaths.   The Federal Government says it won't be relaxing coronavirus social restrictions so the nation's sporting codes can start playing again unless medical advice says it is safe to do so. The NRL yesterday said it wanted to restart its competition at the end of May, but Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told Sky News he expected the NRL would have to change its plans again if social restrictions remain in force. ""I'm sure that the NRL would not want to breach plans, I think that they would not want to breach legal requirements,"" he said. ""I suspect that they are making assumptions on where Australia would be at that point in time, and that's fair enough for them. I mean, of course, they've got to plan."" The NRL, along with other major sporting codes such as the AFL, suspended its season as tough rules to stop the spread of coronavirus came into force.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned the country will not return to normal until a vaccine is developed, saying that could be ""a very long way off"". The warning came after Canada lost a record 1 million jobs in March and unemployment soared to 7.8 per cent — with Canadian Government data suggesting the real jobless rate was closer to 25 per cent. Local governments across Canada have ordered non-essential businesses shut to combat the spread. Health officials in the country say the death toll is set to soar from more than 500 currently, with the two most likely scenarios showing between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths by the end of the pandemic. ""While some of the numbers released today may seem stark, Canada's modelling demonstrates that the country still has an opportunity to control the epidemic,"" Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said. Canadian officials say if all goes well, the first wave of the outbreak could end by July or August, but that there would be subsequent smaller waves.   Tired of waiting for a rescue from Canberra, a group of Australian travellers and aviation specialists have come together to organise charter flights for a rescue mission out of India. India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb its rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases. About 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, decided to help. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" he said. The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar.   The United States has reached a grim milestone: roughly one in 10 workers has lost their job in the past three weeks. Another 6.6 million people sought unemployment benefits last week, taking the total number of applicants to 16.8 million since the pandemic hit. It's the largest and fastest string of job losses in records dating back to 1948, and economists in the United States expect job losses could hit 20 million in April. With more than 95 per cent of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, businesses have shut down across the country. Nevertheless, Wall Street closed out its best week in 45 years, with the S&P 500 surging by 12 per cent. The US Federal Reserve has launched its latest effort to support the economy through the crisis, announcing programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.63 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses. The death toll in France has risen by 1,341 to 12,210 people, the fourth highest tally in the world after Italy, the United States and Spain. That figure includes people who died in care homes over the last two days. More encouragingly, the number of people in intensive care has fallen — albeit slightly — for the first time since the outbreak began. In Italy and Spain, which together have about 33,000 deaths, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But Spain's Prime Minister warned that nationwide confinement would likely last until May. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has surpassed 1.5 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.   The International Monetary Fund says the pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth ""sharply negative"" in 2020, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021. Even though governments have already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $US8 trillion ($12.6 trillion), the IMF said it was likely that more would be needed. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" she said. Ms Georgieva said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF would expect a partial recovery in 2021, but she also warned the situation could actually get worse. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook. It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,"" she said. The IMF will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.   Australian churches will be live streaming — and, in some cases, televising — their Easter services so the faithful can still experience them despite the bans on physical attendance. A Good Friday service from St John's Cathedral in Brisbane will be broadcast on ABC TV at 4:00pm. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney will live stream an Easter Vigil Mass at 6:30pm on Saturday, while its Easter Sunday Mass at 10:30am will also be broadcast on Channel Seven. As well, synagogues that will be streaming Passover services include the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, ACT Jewish Centre in Canberra, and Temple David in Perth. Across the globe, Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly-empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside, while in England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video.   UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned the Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a rise in ""social unrest and violence"". He said the United Nations faced its ""gravest test"" since the organisation was founded 75 years ago. ""This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d'etre of the United Nations itself,"" he said. The Security Council, which had been silent so far on COVID-19, issued its first brief press statement after a closed meeting. It expressed ""support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected"".   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia is being evacuated based on medical advice, as the spread of coronavirus in the country continues to surge. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has assessed that the risk of coronavirus in Indonesia is now too high for diplomats regarded as most vulnerable. It's understood Ambassador Gary Quinlan is regarded as a high risk for acute illness if he were to catch the virus. He's being relocated back home temporarily but will continue as ambassador from Canberra.   Australia's consul in Bali has already returned for similar reasons. The ABC has also learnt that an Australian man has died in Jakarta with symptoms of COVID-19, although he was not tested for the disease. At least one other Australian is known to have been severely ill. There have been 280 confirmed deaths in Indonesia, with 3,293 cases. But a low rate of testing means the true number of deaths and cases is likely to be far higher. The number of cases in Indonesia is expected to peak around May.   Iran's Supreme Leader has called on Iranians to create the sense of Ramadan in their homes, since public gatherings are banned as the country tries to contain one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Schools and universities remain closed in the Islamic Republic and a ban on cultural, religious and sports gatherings has been imposed. Ramadan begins at sundown on April 23 and lasts for 30 days. ""Because of being deprived of public prayings, speeches and so on during Ramadan, we should create the same senses in our homes,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech. His remarks came as Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced that Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen by 117 to 4,110. There are now 66,220 coronavirus cases, he said, noting that 32,309 people have recovered.            ",,"April 10, 2020"
34,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"
35,/news/2020-04-10/visa-holders-in-tasmania-fear-being-forced-home-amid-coronavirus/12140780,Foreign visa holders struggling after missing out on coronavirus JobKeeper package,"The list of things Rosan Bhattarai loves about his adopted home is long.   The Nepali national loves Australia's education system, career opportunities and lifestyle, but chief among his reasons for living and working in the ""lucky country"" for the past seven years is that everyone is treated equally. ""My boss or my manager, I still can put my opinions to them, and that's what really drove me to come to Australia,"" Mr Bhattarai said. From the end of this month, Mr Bhattarai will be without any source of income because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on his tourist-dependent job. Mr Bhattarai is on a foreign visa, meaning he is ineligible for a share in the $130 billion in wage support that passed both houses of the Federal Parliament this week.   The Hobart resident applied for permanent residency two years ago but he is yet to learn whether he has been successful. ""There are people like me who want to contribute to the economy, who are looking forward to the development of themselves and the community as they have been here for so many years,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""We want to help Australia, we want to help create a good version of Australia … and I would request that the Government not put everyone in the same basket."" The Tasmanian Government has worked hard to attract overseas residents to help boost the ageing population and fill gaps in the workforce. The entire state is classed regional, which can help a person's case in applying to become a permanent resident. The Greens tried to amend the Federal Government's JobKeeper package in Parliament on Wednesday to include income support for temporary migrants. Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim said: ""Tasmania has a significant number of foreign workers, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. ""Some business owners are doing their best to look after temporary visa holders with no income, but that should be the Government's job."" People on temporary visas are also ineligible for the JobSeeker payment.   Tasmanian state MP Madeleine Ogilvie described the situation as a ""crisis"", with staff in her office in Hobart's northern suburbs working around the clock to provide support to people like Mr Bhattarai. ""The reality is that we've invited these people here to come study with us, come work with us, come help us and be part of the community, and now things have gotten to a very, very bad stage,"" Ms Ogilvie said. ""At the moment, I don't believe that we as a country and as a state are living up to what we've offered them."" Unions Tasmania has been similarly flooded with calls from people on temporary visas unsure how they will survive without a stable income. ""They pay tax while they're here, they make a contribution, and whilst many of them are not going to be here forever, lots are building their lives here, they're building their home,"" secretary Jessica Munday said. ""We're literally talking about forcing people into destitution and homelessness at a time when we're asking them to stay at home, isolate and stay safe.""   Tasmanian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Simone Zell said member organisations were supporting overseas workers with food and welfare checks. ""The Government is in a position to offer assistance to our migrant visa holders,"" Ms Zell said. ""These people are contributing to our communities and our local economies."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier this week the Government tried to create the broadest and fairest possible JobKeeker scheme but had to ""draw the line somewhere"". The Federal Government will allow migrant workers to access up to $10,000 from their superannuation funds.   Diem Doan has been in Tasmania for about six months, describing it as ""one of the most beautiful states in Australia"". ""It's peaceful, the people here are friendly and lovely and nice, and that drew me,"" Ms Doan said from her Hobart home. ""Also, I want to get permanent residency for the long-term, and Tasmania offers state sponsorship."" After being stood down from her restaurant job, Ms Doan is unsure how she will continue to live in Australia — her home for the past six years.   Her family in Vietnam will provide some financial support, and she will continue to hunt for a new job, she said. ""I still have to go get groceries, I still have to pay for all the bills every month,"" Ms Doan said. ""Luckily my landlord reduced my rent for us, so that's a little support but it really means a lot to us."" Mr Bhattarai said Population Minister Alan Tudge's comment that people who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home was ""heartbreaking"". He and Ms Doan said they were not sure how they would even return to Asia given widespread lockdowns and a lack of flights. ""Australia is one of the countries that has taught me more than my home because I basically did my first job here, I studied my bachelor's here, I have my sisters and in-laws here,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""I don't want to leave Australia because I still want to progress my career, and it's home."" Premier Peter Gutwein said the Tasmanian Government would provide support where it could.

36,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-enforcement-warning-for-easter-weekend/12138518,Easter is 'the most important weekend' in Australia's coronavirus fight as police warn of fines,"On a crucial weekend for Australia's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, leaders have warned there will be no tolerance for breaches of strict self-isolation measures.   Australia's containment controls — including the mandatory quarantine of international visitors, closed state borders and fines for people being outside without a valid reason — have helped ""flatten the curve"" and resulted in fewer than 100 new cases in 24 hours for the first time in three weeks. But Health Minister Greg Hunt warned the Easter weekend was not a time to ease the restrictions. ""As we go into Easter with welcome news for Australia, the virus does not take a holiday, therefore none of us can relax what we do,"" he said. ""This, in many ways, is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus.  ""If we can lock in the gains that we've made as a nation through the courage and sacrifice of those on the health, medical and policing frontlines, but also through the immense goodwill and discipline of Australians, then we can help really protect Australian lives going forward and give ourselves the pathway through."" The restrictions will apply to visits to the beach, attending church services, going interstate or holding large family gatherings.     Each state and territory has announced its own penalties and fines for breaching the restrictions on gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances. State governments have issued strong warnings that police will have helicopters in the air, patrols of holiday destinations and will be using numberplate technology this weekend to find people who are gathering in large groups or who are a long way from their homes.   It comes after several flagrant breaches of the restrictions — including 58 COVID-19 fines for a car rally south of Brisbane, a party at a Sunshine Coast hotel and a man escaping enforced self-isolation in a hotel in Perth and travelling around the city.   Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein warned ""the gloves [had] come off"", announcing a statewide blitz this weekend, including the use of helicopters and police visits to holiday shacks, after reports people were taking campers and trailers to the coast. ""We still have Tasmanians that are flouting the rules,"" he said. ""I have been fair, I have been reasonable and I have taken every step and every precaution that we can to save lives. But we will only save lives if Tasmanians follow the rules.   ""Today we'll be putting helicopters up. There will be eyes in the sky.""   Officers in Victoria will also be checking holiday destinations to enforce compliance, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said. ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you.""   Queensland has introduced a permit for residents returning to the state, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warning ""now is not the time to go into New South Wales"" and refusing to rule out stricter border controls. Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said there were still too many people trying to use beaches, which were closed to ""out-of-towners"". ""Last weekend, we had so many people descend onto the Gold Coast that those social-distancing measures were so extraordinarily difficult to enforce, people were still sunbaking, congregating, and this is what we want to avoid,"" she said. ""What we're saying is please can you just stay home for these next few weeks. You can still get out and do your exercise, but do it locally. New South Wales Arts Minister Don Harwin was forced to apologise and return to Sydney after being sprung at his Central Coast holiday house, despite bans on non-essential travel. The state has also announced $5,000 fines for people who deliberately spit or cough on frontline workers in response to reports of abuse and assault towards people in uniform. Police around Australia have already issued hundreds of fines for breaching the self-isolation legislation.    ",By Liam Butterworth,"April 10, 2020"
37,/news/2020-03-17/coronavirus-cases-data-reveals-how-covid-19-spreads-in-australia/12060704,ABC coronavirus data charts COVID-19 spread in Australia,"The charts below provide a guide to how Australia is faring in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. They use figures from a national dataset of every confirmed case since January 25, when the country's first four cases were reported.  The data, compiled by ABC News, tracks confirmed cases by gender, age, location, source of infection and other information published in case reports from state and federal health authorities. It is supplemented with additional reporting by ABC News and updated daily to show the spread of the disease across Australia's states and territories. The latest update was at ___  (Tap/hover on any chart for more information.) To date, state and territory health authorities have reported  ___ confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia, including __ deaths. Roughly ___ , or ___ new cases, were reported in the past 48 hours.  (Note that national daily and cumulative counts are likely to be lower earlier in the day, as some states/territories will not have reported their figures yet.) But the number of confirmed cases is only part of the story. An important measure of the spread of infectious disease is the growth rate. One way of tracking growth is by looking at the daily percentage change in total confirmed cases. This shows Australia's growth rate has fallen from a peak of more than 25 per cent in mid-March to less than 5 per cent in early April, based on the five-day moving average. The aim is to reach zero — and stay there. Another way of measuring the spread of disease is by how long it takes the number of confirmed cases to double — also known as the ""doubling time"". This is easier to see when the number of confirmed cases is plotted on a log scale.  On the chart above, each tick on the vertical axis is 10 times the value of the previous tick. The slope of the line shows how long it takes the number of cases to rise from 10 to 100 to 1000, and so on. The steeper the line, the faster the growth rate. It shows that for most of March, Australia's count of confirmed cases doubled every 3-4 days. However, there are signs it is slowing — although experts warn the trend may not be sustained. Here is the same chart but for each of the states and territories. It shows the largest states are on roughly the same growth trajectory. A similar kind of chart can be used to compare Australia's growth rate to other countries.  This one uses the same log scale but rather than exact dates, it tracks each country's cumulative case count from the day that country reached 100 cases. This brings each country onto the same timeline. It shows that in many countries, including Australia, the number of confirmed infections grew rapidly early in the outbreak, doubling every 3 days or less.  In other countries, such as Japan and Singapore, initial growth rates were slower, with cases taking a week or more to double . The chart also shows that countries such as South Korea and China started with very steep growth rates but now have much flatter lines, which means they have successfully slowed their growth rates. (For more on how other countries are winning the fight against COVID-19, read this analysis.) Figures for Australia show ___ has the most confirmed cases, making up ___ of the total number of infections, followed by ___ and ___. However, the picture shifts when population size is taken into account.  Adjusting the figures for the number of residents shows ___ still has the highest number of infections per 100,000 residents, but it is followed by ___, then ___. ___ has the lowest infections per 100,000, followed by ___. Nationally, ___ people have died — __. At least 17 deaths across the country were of cruise ships passengers. Figures show __ people have recovered from the disease, leaving ___ confirmed cases still current or ""active"". The vast majority of current cases do not require hospitalisation.  The chart below shows the number of people in hospital (including in ICU and ventilated) as a percentage of current cases in each state and territory. Nationally, __ people (or __ per cent of current cases) are receiving hospital care, including __ (or __ per cent of current cases) in ICU.  Of those in ICU, __ (__ per cent of current cases) are ventilated. (Figures for the number of ventilated patients in WA are pending.) These hospitalisation figures are based on a snapshot of a point in time, rather than a cumulative count of patients hospitalised since the virus was first detected in Australia. It is important to note that case numbers and diagnosis rates are heavily influenced by the rate of testing.  At roughly 1,250 tests per 100,000 residents, Australia's rate of testing per capita is among the highest in the world, according to figures from Our World in Data. However, federal government figures show the number of tests added each day — think of this as similar to the daily ""growth rate"" of tests — has fallen in recent weeks. It is unclear how much this has influenced the apparent slowdown in new diagnoses. The bars in this chart show the cumulative number of samples tested each day in Australia. The lines show the percentage change (or ""growth rate"") in the cumulative number of tests. Nationally, the number of tests added each day has fallen from a peak of 8 per cent on March 26 to less than 4 per cent since April 7, based on the 5-day moving average. Notably, this decline has coincided with the expansion of coronavirus testing criteria.  Some experts have linked the fall to lower numbers of returned travellers. Others have attributed it to fewer people presenting with symptoms. A breakdown of total tests by jurisdiction shows ___ has tested the most samples of any state or territory, followed by ___ then ___. However, adjusting for population shows ___ has the highest rate of testing, at roughly ___ the rate in ___, which has the nation's lowest rate of testing. ___ and ___ have the second- and third-highest rates of testing, respectively. Data on the percentage of tests that come back positive for COVID-19 show __, then __ and ___, have the highest positive test rates, while ___ and ___ have the lowest.  Again, this is influenced by testing rates, since the broader the testing regime, the lower the odds of finding positive cases.  Another way of looking at rates of testing is to compare the number of residents to the number of tests, both as a share of the national total. ___ accounts for ___ of Australia’s population but ___ of samples tested in Australia, while __ accounts for ___ of the population but ___ of tests. By contrast, ___ makes up ___ of the population but only ___ of tests. Similarly, ___ accounts for just over ___ of Australia's population, but only ___ of tests. People ___ have the most confirmed cases of any age group. However, adjusting these numbers for the size of each age group shows people __ have the highest rate of confirmed cases.  They are followed by people __ and people  __, and then those ___. When a case is confirmed, health authorities undertake detailed tracing to identify the source of transmission. Nationally, ___ of cases were acquired overseas, while ___ were acquired locally. This includes ___ transmitted locally with no known link to a confirmed case or cluster. A breakdown of the data by gender suggests little difference in the rate of diagnosis between men and women.     Dates refer to the date the case was reported by authorities, except in these instances: - The 5th, 6th and 7th confirmed cases in Victoria have been assigned to the date they were first cited in official press releases. These cases were first announced on March 1, as having recovered from the virus. - Dates for the 7th and 8th confirmed cases in Queensland (Diamond Princess cruise ship evacuees) are based on ABC News reports. The 9th confirmed Queensland case, another Diamond Princess evacuee, was first announced in a press release on March 3.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the world's poorest countries would suffer the most if the COVID-19 fallout drove markets to their lowest levels since the 1930s. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" Ms Georgieva said, speaking ahead of next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. She said the IMF would release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that would show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak had turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn.    Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis.  Now the expectation is more than 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this year.    Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at high risk, she said.   ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Ms Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession.  As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries has totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the past two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Ms Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices.   Numbers released on Thursday by the US Government showed 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.  That amounts to about one in 10 American workers — the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since the world's largest economy began keeping records in 1948. And still more job cuts are expected.  The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent, a number not seen since the tail end of the Great Depression. Ms Georgieva said there was no question 2020 would be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF was forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said.  ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.""   She said she and World Bank president David Malpass would pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they could use for critical health needs. She also said the IMF was prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that needed help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board agreed to double the loan levels it would provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide about $US100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

39,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482,"What causes a 'second wave' outbreak of coronavirus, and could we see this in Australia?","Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing. However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection. As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.     Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one. If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away. When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity. If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.   Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection. Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last. The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely. As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.   A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission. If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave. When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.   Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate. Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection. In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound. We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave. However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19. Australia's current efforts are focused on ""flattening the curve"" of the first wave of COVID-19. Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising. But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave. And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward. We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

40,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-lessons-we-can-learn-from-history/12134044,Coronavirus lessons we can learn from other dark times in history,"""One thing I've learned in life is, money can be a very lonely companion. Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.   ""Far from people staying at home, they were being drawn out,"" he said. ""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last? Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said. ""There's a sense that the pandemic has exposed all sorts of gaps in policy ""A whole series of things that people have been advocating for years but got nowhere, are they going to become possible after this?""

41,/news/2020-04-10/darwin-ranger-jailed-for-drug-importation/12137930,Darwin council ranger sentenced in NT Supreme Court for supply of dangerous drugs,"A former Darwin council ranger, who used her job to scope out vacant properties for drug deliveries, has been sentenced in the Northern Territory Supreme Court for the ""careful and methodical"" supply of dangerous drugs.    Kirsten Rose Strickland, 41, worked for the City of Darwin when she organised for more than 100 parcels of drugs ordered on the dark web to be delivered to empty Darwin properties and Australia Post offices. ""The addresses were not randomly chosen by you, rather, you operated in a careful and methodical fashion,"" Justice Peter Barr said in sentencing. ""You identified unoccupied dwellings which were advertised for rent or for sale, to which you could have drugs delivered.  ""You also acquainted yourself with Australia Post mail routes and the timing of postal deliveries."" Between June 2018 and January 2019, Strickland ordered 154 packages of drugs from 41 international vendors and had them delivered to 30 different Darwin properties, addressed to 74 different identities.    The Northern Territory Supreme Court heard police located detailed maps of Darwin city, postal timetables and drug paraphernalia during a search of Strickland's Darwin CBD apartment.  In November 2018, after investigations by a joint taskforce of NT Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police and others, officers followed Strickland as she collected parcels from empty letterboxes around Darwin while driving a council vehicle and wearing her ranger uniform.  An empty package, containing traces of MDMA, was recovered in a bin outside the Darwin Council offices.  ""At the time of your arrest on 16 November 2018, Australian Border Force and NT Police had identified and intercepted 32 consignments of drugs ordered by you addressed to non-existent recipients,"" Justice Barr said. A further seven packages were delivered after Strickland had been taken into custody.  The court heard Strickland had never used drugs until she ""became deeply depressed"" and began using ecstasy in January 2018 at the age of 40.  A mental health report indicated a link between Strickland's mental health issues and drug use, however, Justice Barr rejected any argument that it led to her supply of commercial quantities of drugs.    ""Your depressive illness does not explain your venture into drug importation and commercial supply in what was a well-organised and methodical operation, both logistically and in terms of meticulous record keeping,"" Justice Barr said.  The court heard there was a ""significant element of fraud and dishonesty"" as well as Strickland's drug supply crimes. Strickland profited about $100,000 from the sale of dangerous drugs over six months. ""You somehow convinced yourself at the time of offending that you were not a drug dealer and you were just ensuring high-quality drugs for yourself and your friends,"" said Justice Barr.  ""However, rationalisations and excuses for criminal conduct are common."" Strickland pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying dangerous drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and almost 50 times the commercial threshold of MDMA.  She was sentenced to six years in jail, with a four year and three-month non-parole period. The 41-year-old is no longer an employee of the City of Darwin.",By Melissa Mackay,"April 10, 2020"

43,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-empty-nest-full-again/12123600,Coronavirus self-isolation with my adult children is like a blast from the past,"A lot of us are in lockdown with kids in the house. But what do you do when those kids are university students who haven't lived at home for months? In a city where rents are expensive, and the interstate university colleges where they used to live are closed, my family finds itself in self-isolation with two university students who are studying online. Suddenly, we are a family of four again. I was delighted to have our beautiful young adults back with us. We were hoping to take advantage of reassimilating and getting to know each other again, doing the quality-time thing.  But it's a different landscape to raising school-age children. For one, the hours are different.   As I write this it's about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I've been up with my husband since before 7am and Uni Student One, who is 20, has just got out of bed.  The younger one is still asleep. We don't expect him to grace us with his presence before 5pm.   Living with uni students is like living with perpetual jetlag except that it is not your own. We aren't operating on the same time zones. Now let me qualify this: they haven't been out disobeying the Government's directions to not socialise in groups of more than two. They haven't had any mates to the house — we are self-isolating after all. They haven't even left the house in over a week.  So far, so legally good. Yet neither of them were in bed until after 5am so they are catching up on their eight hours. Like the possums and bats that frequent the nightscape around where we live, I've discovered my sons are nocturnal: their natural hours of wakefulness barely coincide with mine.  I'm used to a little coming and going during the night (okay sometimes more than a little) but it's an adjustment having them back, and for them too after the freedoms of living away.   It's not just the time zones that are different. The culture shock is real too. While in lockdown, one son has decided to take up a hobby: he's learning guitar.  And while it might be lovely to be strummed to sleep it's far less enjoyable being awoken in the middle of the night to the sound of someone attempting to learn a Jimmy Hendrix riff. (And I stress that's not ""playing"", just ""learning"", which means repeating the same series of chords over and over and over again, and singing the same lyrics on repeat).   Uni Student 2, traditionally the more sporty of the two, has set up a home gym out the back of the house and in the garage using whatever he can cobble together. This means some old weights, some kitchen items, the broom, a back pack with what I think must be dirt inside. Frankly, I don't want to know. I was so looking forward to life with my children again. But instead, life with the uni students means every four bars of Hendrix's Foxy Lady is punctuated with the great thud of a dropped weight on the concrete or a loud grunt of exertion. My sons' body clocks make it impossible for us to time meals together (so much for that quality time).  Hubby and I eat regularly at 7.30pm and the meal we choose at that time is called dinner. Not breakfast.   Dinner for the nocturnal members of the household occurs around 3am and involves microwaving the prepared family meal that they couldn't eat at their ""breakfast"" time. If they are still hungry, I can look forward to a cacophony of banging. It's not weights or music this time, but pots and pans, kitchen drawers, microwave oven doors and fridge doors, over and over again. It finishes not long before my day to begins again, at 6am, with the aftermath from this 3am banquet they didn't quite manage to clean up. So what to do with people who are vibrantly alive in the middle of the night while us parents are trying to sleep in order to be ready to work from home in the morning?  There's plenty of advice for home schooling or entertaining 10-year-olds with online trips to the zoo or recycled craft projects. But what do you do with young people who are a little too old to be sent to bed or the naughty corner? In this household, it's a dilemma that has added a strange new layer to self-isolation. And even though they're young adults it reminds of a time when we used to be awoken to the cries of hunger or the dirty nappy and the argument about who had to get up earlier for work tomorrow and who could do without sleep and get up and change the baby! We'll be thankful they toilet themselves now and feed themselves at whatever time. Because for the first time in a while we're all back together, in the one nest, with time to laugh about who was the loudest baby, who was the most terrible two year old and who made Mum angry. Best of all we get to enjoy those Dad jokes all over again! Who would have thought that there was a silver lining to coronavirus lockdown but it's nice to have time to be ""us four"" again.  So we continue to be patient, as much as we can, for as long as this time lasts.    ",By Mary-Elizabeth Brien,"April 10, 2020"

What a radical idea … but one that is increasingly true of today's generation of grandmothers.  A sweet memory of my time as president of the Australian Human Rights Commission was being asked by my executive assistant to look down from my Pitt Street office to the Grandmothers for Refugees singing in the street below to support the commission and its advocacy for refugees detained indefinitely in offshore detention camps. What a delight to see the men in their suits walk by in bemused wonderment. How mistaken to dismiss these grandmothers as having passed their use-by date. Why should we be surprised? This generation of grandmothers came from the '60s and '70s, many — and for the first time in history — spending formative years at university with free or minimal fees, marching against Vietnam, experimenting with sexual liberation, burning our bras and ""making love not war"". Political activism is mother's milk to many of the women from those times. Over the following years, this unique generation of women rode the crest of a wave of opportunity and optimism. The Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1984 — problem of equality fixed. The future was ours. And, to a significant degree, so it has been. Today, women over 60 are often well-educated and financially independent, having had a fruitful career while also doing a decent job of raising their children. Today, the '60s generation of women is emerging as a political force to be reckoned with.   But wait. How can it be that the position of women in Australia has been in regression over the past 15 years or so? Here are some disturbing facts. The fastest-growing group of homeless people in Australia is not 18-year-old youths sleeping under a bridge, but women over 55. How ignominious and sad to have to ask your son or niece if you can sleep on their sofa for a few weeks as you can no longer pay the rent or the mortgage. Women retire today on 46 per cent of the superannuation available to men. Why? Because we agree to accept flexible, casual and contract work with little job security or opportunities for promotion. We fall off the superannuation ladder and never catch up, despite providing most unpaid caring work across the nation. Women are still at the bottom of the employment pyramid in female-dominated industries — as hospital paramedics and cleaners, factory workers, maids and waitresses, in hotels and restaurants and in low-paid teaching and nursing positions. The gender pay gap of around 16 per cent is narrowing with glacial speed. In 2006, the World Economic Forum's Gender Index placed Australia 15th globally, broadly among the nations we would most expect to be compared with — New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Scandinavian countries. Ten years later, in 2016, we had slipped to 46th. By 2018, we had gone up a few points to 39th. Our 2020 ranking is 44th. We remain today stubbornly consigned to the lower ranks, below Serbia, Bolivia, Laos, Latvia, Cuba and Burundi.   The WEF Global Index is measured against four indices: economic participation, health and survival, educational attainment and political empowerment. The good news is that, not surprisingly, Australian women and girls are ranked first in the world for educational attainment. But now the bad news: we are a 103rd for health, 77th for ministerial positions in government, 49th for political empowerment and 46th for economic participation. Our hopes for fair access to work were raised by Tony Abbott's promise, as leader of the opposition, of a ""rolled-gold"" six months' maternity leave, only to be dashed when the political debate descended into allegations women were ""double dippers"" and ""welfare cheats"". The law for Australian women remains at 18 weeks' paid maternity leave at minimum wage, compared with Sweden's paternity leave of 480 days at 80 per cent of salary. How has it come to this? Why has education not ensured genuine equality? Why are Australia's women not in the streets demanding fairness from a male-dominated government and corporate sector? Are we, at heart, just like our grandmothers? Has very little really changed? Are grandmothers, by culture or by a law of nature, destined merely to be sweet, passive, caring and kind; to stand behind their men, support the family, love their grandchildren and seek little for themselves?   My grandmother, Sarah-Jane, met all these clichéd standards. She was born in the reign of Queen Victoria, in 1899. She admirably met the traditional image of a grandmother: pretty, even in old age, white-haired and blue-eyed. In 1958, as we stood on the deck of the Iberia, the flagship of the Orient and Pacific Line, leaving from Tilbury Docks for Australia, my mother said, ""Give your grandmother a special wave. She is old and we may not see her again."" Sarah-Jane was 62, dressed in black, wearing pearl earrings and 60-denier lisle stockings, wrinkled at her ankles. Widowed at 53, with few financial resources, she had never been employed. Sarah-Jane was largely dependent on her daughters and sons-in-law.   She came to Melbourne several times to visit us and lived to be 89. Sarah-Jane avoided any sort of disagreement or controversy in private, let alone in the public arena. ""A lady's name should appear in the newspapers only three times in her life: on birth, marriage and death."" She would have been horrified to know that her granddaughter was the subject of 42 satirical cartoons and more than 60,000 words (and counting) of newsprint castigating me for my work as president of the AHRC. For Sarah-Jane, family was all. She believed wholeheartedly in the adage that blood is thicker than water. As one of a typically large Victorian family of eight siblings, she was never particularly interested in widening her small group of friends. I have followed her directions for a successful dinner party. It was bad form, she believed, to engage in one-to-one private conversations; a general conversation among the group on a neutral topic was the desired objective. Sex and religion should never be discussed. In this, I have strayed from her protocol. But I also prefer a wide-ranging debate at dinner. When I was first married to my husband and joined international diplomatic life as a ""trailing spouse"", I remember him accusing me of conducting seminars at official dinner parties! Sarah-Jane might have been surprised to know that she has been a driving motivator in my life. As a teenager in the early '60s, I have a vivid memory of one of her visits. She was sitting up in bed, counting out her small change on the bedspread to see if she could stretch her money to buy a Christmas present for each member of the family. The sum total was pitiful. Sarah-Jane had no means to increase her funds beyond whatever the family's largesse had provided her. Mercifully, my parents were in business as jewellers and were, indeed, generous. At Christmas, we each received a modest gift from Sarah-Jane, and I treasured mine. Yet another seemingly insignificant incident compounded my understanding of my grandmother's loss of autonomy. Like Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Sarah-Jane always wore pearls: three-strand necklaces and earrings. As the earrings were clipped on (pierced ears were vulgar), she was constantly losing one. To go out in public without her pearls was unthinkable. She would ask my father, through the agency of my mother, to buy her new ones. As the saga of the lost earring was oft-repeated, my father became increasingly annoyed, but would eventually relent and provide another. I was struck at the time by the ignominy of Sarah-Jane's position.   Today, if I had lost such an item, I would simply buy a replacement without a second thought. I doubt she was ever able to enjoy that freedom. Such minuscule details of ordinary life mark how things have changed for women today who have financial autonomy. Even as a young girl, I was mortified by the evident frustration of an older woman who had so little financial independence. I vowed never to be in that position. I knew, instinctively, that to reach whatever potential one might have, it was essential, as Virginia Woolf well understood, to have ""a room of one's own"". That is not to say that money has been a catalyst for my work over the decades, but rather that a reliable income is vital to achieving autonomy. Sarah-Jane also had a steely inner core. Arriving home after school one day, I was shocked when she asked me, ""Will you do the ironing or shall I?"" As she'd left the house for work that morning, my mother had apparently airily asked my grandmother to iron the ever-mounting pile of sheets, shirts and napkins, always the last household chore to be tackled. From my mother's point of view, as Sarah-Jane was at home all day, this seemed to be an entirely reasonable request. Not so for Sarah-Jane. The heat of the summer was inescapable and enervating. She was probably about 70 years old. Far better to ask a healthy teenager. I, of course, agreed to do the ironing, but filed away for future reference that my grandmother was smarter than others gave her credit for! As Sarah-Jane sank into the oblivion of Alzheimer's, she lived out her last years in an aged-care residence in London. Whenever I returned to England, I would visit my tranquil, beautifully dressed grandmother, who, having no idea who I was, said to me, ""You're a nice young girl. Do come to see me again."" I would leave in tears, but grateful that Sarah-Jane had at least found some sort of serenity.   Delving into these sepia-tinted flashes from the past, I am surprised by how powerful — even hurtful — they remain. Why would I care today about such fleeting incidents, which one might have imagined would quickly fade? I do not know. But perhaps the psychologists would say that such early experiences shape our adult lives in profound, lasting and unexpected ways. Sarah-Jane would not recognise my 21st-century role as a grandmother. At 74, I am working, travelling and continuing to be outspoken. My grandchildren, Sia (aged four) and Leonard (aged two), live an international life in Paris and are becoming bilingual. I speak to them by Skype and babysit for a couple of weeks in July when the creches and schools are closed for the summer. Every second year, they come to Australia for Christmas. I have some French and would love to speak to my grandchildren in their first language. Rightly, their parents, my son James and his French partner, Marie, insist that I speak only English, otherwise Sia and Leonard will adopt the easy option of French. Sia thinks I am intellectually rather slow. If I mispronounce a word in French or make a grammatical error (quelle horreur), she corrects me and, in exasperation, employs both the English and French words to ensure I get her point. I love being with such bright, energetic children and am sometimes sad that I am a distant, fly-in, fly-out spectre in their lives. My relationship with my grandchildren will be very different from many grandparenting relationships of the past. Different but, I hope, just as special. The geographical distance means that I will not be part of the day-to-day lives of Sia and Leonard. I will not be able to pick them up from school and hear their triumphs and woes. I will always be the visitor who swans into town, breaks the household rules with forbidden treats and goes away again. I will not be there to listen to whispered hopes and fears, nor will I be a gentle, calm and constant presence in their lives. But I will bring to Sia and Leonard that fierce loyalty for family that Sarah-Jane maintained, rightly or wrongly, as well as her warmth and integrity. I hope to be a strong influence in their lives; to stimulate, excite and support them in every way possible. Perhaps I can show them what a woman can achieve in her lifetime, given the opportunity and a dash of determination.   I suspect many women today grapple with finding a new version of the contemporary grandmother, as they retain a traditional view of a caring woman with little autonomy or life beyond her family. Grandmothers today are likely to be healthy, relatively fit and up for a game of tennis or a ski trip (on the moderate slopes). With some significant exceptions (for example, those who have no superannuation, live alone or have high medical expenses), today's grandmother will have financial means of her own, a career and a fruitful, active life. She will nurture her grandchildren, but will be less passive, more actively engaged with the world, freer to rise to her own potential and, I suggest, happier than many grandmothers in the past, with greater self-confidence. While my generation has been uniquely privileged in so many ways, I believe that, as grandmothers, we should use our remaining years and decades to reach out to our less privileged sisters to bring them with us. Too many women have been left behind. The promises of the '60s and '70s have not been met fully for all Australian women. We grandmothers now have a responsibility to advocate, to be politically active in using our education and financial independence to ensure equality of opportunity and outcome. For all women.   How dismaying that I should have studied for a law degree, a Master of Laws and a PhD, all at the expense of the Australian, American and British taxpayers, while law students today will finish their JD degree $100,000 in debt. As grandmothers, we should be demanding affordable childcare, full superannuation even when on maternity and carers leave, equal pay for equal work, freedom from sexual harassment and bullying in employment, and protection from domestic violence at home. As grandmothers, what do we have to lose? We are not looking for advancement in our careers. We are strong, healthy and independent. Bravo to Grandmothers for Refugees, the Older Women's Network and the scores of other women's advocacy and networking groups. Let us work together to harness the power of today's generation of grandmothers, who can and will speak up for social justice. Let us work together to achieve the vision of gender equality that we and our political leaders had in the 60s and 70s. I like to think that, in Sarah-Jane's quiet way, she would have supported my outspokenness on human rights and forgiven me my notorious media presence. I now understand better the continuing influence she has had on my life, and thank her for it. Postscript: I am about to leave for Geneva to take up a new role in the United Nations as Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. For the first time in my grandchildren's lives, I will be only three hours by train from Paris. It seems one should never say never. Maybe in the future I can be a more real presence in their lives than I had believed possible.

She's being kind to elderly patients, providing them with the best quality of movement she can, and making their interactions pleasant by chatting and caring. But the religious character of her place of work makes a difference to Jihan's experience. She has worked in a Christian aged care setting in the past, but now works at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first aged care home serving Muslim residents. Jihan says the ethos of respect for the elderly and putting residents' needs first is the same as at any other facility. But she tells me there's something particularly comforting about working in a Muslim organisation.   I spoke to Jihan because I wanted to explore how working within your own religious community can impact a person's sense of belonging and purpose. It can be a fraught discussion — hypotheticals swirled around the Federal Government's religious discrimination bill before coronavirus took over. The second draft of this legislation was released late last year, and changes include allowing religious bodies like hospitals and aged care providers to preference employees who belong to the same religion. The bill says this kind of discrimination is aimed at allowing these organisations to maintain their religious ethos. What I wanted to investigate was something different: employees' experience of working in a religious organisation and the impact of combining work and spiritual beliefs. On the other side of the discussion are people who work in a religious setting without sharing those beliefs. The people I spoke to emphasised the ""Christian values"" and ""Muslim philosophy"" inherent in their work — but these are principles that are shared across religious lines, and of course by people who don't subscribe to any faith at all. Jihan grew up in a Lebanese Muslim household, where her parents taught her the importance of giving back to the community. She works as a physiotherapist at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first Muslim-focused aged care facility. Staff members speak Turkish, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu to cater to a culturally diverse Muslim community. Residents ""feel at home when they know that someone can speak their language"", Jihan says. Islamic artwork decorates the home, which has dedicated prayer rooms available for residents and staff and sits next door to the Gallipoli Mosque. Staff members organise residents' treatments around their prayer times, mindful of avoiding a clash and maintaining their Muslim rituals.   Reflecting on her previous workplace, Jihan recalls having to navigate social expectations that didn't match up with her religious practices. Though she was a part of the team and liked social outings to celebrate the end of the week, as a non-drinker she felt she had to ""sit on the side"" when colleagues went to the pub. At Gallipoli Home, she says, ""they work around the religious needs that we have"". ""I can pray next door at the mosque, or I can go and pray in the prayer room, whereas at another workplace, you're scrambling to find the storeroom to pray [only] once or twice a day."" This sensitivity to religious practices means there's no extra pressure on employees like Jihan. ""I can order food straight from our kitchen and I know it's halal, whereas over there, you're looking for somewhere to get some halal food."" Breann Fallon sits on the other end of the spectrum — she works at the Sydney Jewish Museum.   ""If you're going to ask me what I tick on the census, I would tick 'other Christian',"" she says. ""Prior to working at the museum, my connections to the Jewish community were pretty much zilch."" Breann says it was a visit during her school years that prompted her interest in working at the museum. The team's ""strong mission to try and learn from the horrors of the past"" appealed to her. And she says it's their shared goal to ""try and turn it into something that we can learn from and create a better world"".   Rather than being excluded, being part of a religious workplace has given Breann a wider view of tradition and culture. ""I've been so accepted by the Jewish community here. At Easter I would do Pesach [Passover] as well as Easter. I celebrate the Jewish High Holidays as well as Christian traditions,"" she says. ""I also see value in philosophies from other faiths as well. So it's a real mixed bag for me."" Tash Holmes works at Uniting, in a job that links churches in the NSW and ACT presbyteries to the community to facilitate social justice programs. She grew up in the Baptist Church and went to a religious high school, then became involved with Hillsong through worship music.   It's been a rather roundabout route to the Uniting Church and an organisation that she says is ""anchored in compassion, respect, being bold and imaginative"". In fact, when she came out several years ago, Tash didn't see a place for herself socially in any church, let alone making her career in the community. She describes realising and sharing that she was gay while a member of Hillsong as ""coming out into a desert land"", and says she didn't know who she could rely on for support. ""There weren't a lot of accepting churches out there. And faith was still important to me,"" she explains. ""I was still wrestling between faith and sexuality and just trying to find a place where you could even talk to someone about it.""   Though she doesn't belong to the Pentecostal group anymore, it's vital for Tash to be visible as a member of the LBGTIQ+ community in a religious context. ""Uniting was the only Christian organisation that would accept me in the workplace and in their churches,"" she says. She knows there are secular social justice organisations that could offer her the same professional fulfilment, but she's able to also meet her spiritual needs through the work that she does. ""I think the church still has a lot of work to do in this space around LGBTI people of faith,"" she says. ""This is my passion. This is this is the work that I want to see out. And there's no other place to do it.""  ",ABC Radio National      By Alice Moldovan for ABC Religion and Ethics,"April 10, 2020"
