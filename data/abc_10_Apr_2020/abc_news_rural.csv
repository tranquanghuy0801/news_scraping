The Sydney Fish Market, which usually attracts more than 40,000 people over the holiday weekend, has beefed up security and will restrict numbers in its retail outlets.   Chief executive officer Greg Dyer said the market could turn over $10 million in a normal Easter period, but he expected the public's general compliance with stay-at-home advice could halve this. ""We're not entirely sure how many visitors we'll get on the site, but we expect a dramatic reduction and those that do come will see a very different Sydney Fish Market,"" Mr Dyer said. ""A very well organised and highly drilled Sydney Fish Market will make sure we are maintaining all of the requirements under the COVID-19 regulations.""   Good Friday, traditionally the busiest day of the year, will operate with extended trading hours from 5am until 5pm. Parking and pedestrian entry will be restricted on site and police will support enhanced security. The market's five seafood retailers will limit the number of customers allowed inside at any one time and will operate under a one-way traffic system.    De Costi Seafood manager Carmelo Lombardo said online orders had grown by close to 70 per cent during the COVID-19 crisis but he wanted to reassure customers physical-distancing measures would not detract from their Easter market experience. ""Rest assured that when you do buy seafood down the market, you know we have an environment where you can shop at your own leisure but in a safe way,"" Mr Lombardo said.   Prices on Australia's biggest seafood auction floor have surged this week in the lead-up to Easter.   According to Kerry Strangas from the Master Fish Merchants Association, prices collapsed last month after restaurants and the food service industry stopped trading. ""The prices have steadied again, there's not as much product so the fishermen are getting a reasonable price and a fair price,"" Mr Strangas said. ""We want the fishermen to keep fishing and for us to keep trading."" He said if prices collapsed it would be dire. ""Then the industry is gone because you're not going to get out of bed if you don't get what you deserve for your product.""   The improved market has been a godsend for fishers such as Danny Green who operates a trap fishing business out of Coffs Harbour in New South Wales.   ""Probably two weeks ago, up until this last week, fish prices have been crap,"" Mr Green said. ""Now, just before Easter, snapper prices are the highest I've ever seen them. You're looking at $25 to $26 a kilogram.""   At Lake Munmorah in NSW, mesh net and mud crab fisher Allan Reed said some of his catch had been sold for bait two weeks ago because of the reduced demand.    He was also getting less than $8 a kilogram for mud crabs, but this week they earned $57 a kilogram. ""It got so bad I was only working one day a week,"" Mr Reed said.

2,/news/2020-04-09/backpacker-accommodation-shortage-risks-veg-harvest-coronavirus/12132718,"Essential fruit and veg pickers 'homeless' due to coronavirus, meaning crops may be left to rot","The fruit and vegetable industry has warned that crops may be left to rot in fields because of a major shortage of accommodation for backpackers who pick the produce.   Growcom, the peak industry body in Queensland, said many hostels and caravan parks, where backpackers usually stayed in farming towns, had closed their doors in response to coronavirus. Some young travellers told the ABC they had resorted to camping illegally in forests and on rural land and were sleeping in their cars because of the lack of accommodation. Lasse Ortmann had been travelling the world before COVID-19 abruptly disrupted his working holiday.   ""Until this point I have really enjoyed my trip. Hopefully after the crisis I can keep on travelling,"" he said. Far from his home in northern Germany, Mr Ortmann is in Bridgetown, three hours south of Perth. But for him and the backpackers he has met in Australia, finding a roof for the night is nearly impossible. ""We were homeless. All the hostels, caravan parks, even the free caravan parks are closed,"" he said. ""So we stayed illegally in the forest; it was the only possibility we had at this time. ""We felt pretty desperate because we didn't know where to go, we didn't know what we should do next.""     Like many young international travellers, Mr Ortmann has been employed at cattle stations and watermelon and pumpkin farms to comply with his working holiday visa requirements. Holiday makers and seasonal workers are crucial to ensuring fruit and vegetable farmers have enough labour to plant and pick their crops. The Federal Government has announced it will allow backpackers to extend their stays in Australia to help meet the agricultural labour demand. But the horticulture industry said there was nowhere for many of those travellers to sleep, prompting warnings about the supply of winter fruit and vegetables in the coming months. ""We need to acknowledge there is some risk that a lack of accommodation could mean that some crops don't get harvested,"" said Growcom spokesman Richard Shannon. He said while many accommodation options such as hostels and caravan parks were closed, supply was even tighter because the Commonwealth announced that, in a bid to protect regional communities, backpackers would also have to self-isolate for 14 days before they started work.     ""We need to distance ourselves personally from one another; that means that less people can live in the same sorts of arrangements we had previously, and that just reduces the number of beds that are available,"" Mr Shannon said. ""We've seen plenty of rough camping, people sleeping in cars, pulling up wherever they can get access to at least some facilities like toilet blocks.   ""I am concerned. I think it's indicative of there being a great amount of disruption in the rest of the economy."" Mr Shannon said he understood why some hostels and caravan parks had closed and he called on governments to help solve the problem. Citrus grower Judy Shepherd, who farms at Gayndah, three-and-a-half hours north-west of Brisbane, said without appropriate accommodation for backpackers, some fruit and vegetables might not be picked. ""There's always a concern that getting enough staff at the right time in a harvest is difficult; this year it's even more difficult because of the new restrictions around travel,"" she said. ""There is a risk some crops may not be harvested."" Ms Shepherd said farming communities were urgently trying to find a solution. ""Trying to assist farmers to develop programs to take more [backpackers] than they would normally accommodate on their own farms, there's a lot of problems around that issue,"" she said. ""Another solution is potentially setting up temporary large-scale accommodation centres in towns that could cover the overflow from the parks, could provide some security for backpackers, and also offer isolation areas should someone become ill.""     That would be a huge relief for backpackers like Jan Spacek from the Czech Republic, who is trying to find farm work in New South Wales. He said the stress of looking for employment and a place to sleep was taking its toll. ""I would become homeless if there are no people who would help me, because I have no shelter or a place to stay,"" Mr Spacek said. ""I would be just completely without anything in the land I am a stranger. ""It's a situation you don't wish upon anyone; it's just a hard situation and I have to handle it in some way.""

4,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-queensland-seafood-sales-easter-cheap/12129506,Coronavirus lockdown sees prawns drop to 1980 prices ahead of Easter splurge,"Seafood suppliers, fish markets and trawlers have been hit hard by the impacts of coronavirus but Queenslanders' love of seafood and unusually low prices have given the industry a temporary boost.   Normally seafood suppliers are gearing up for one of the busiest times of the year, but this Easter long queues and huge volumes of pre-orders have been replaced with takeaway services and home deliveries. Prawn trawler Daryl Davis, based at Shorncliffe on Brisbane's bayside, said consumers would benefit with freshly caught prawns at the lowest prices he had ever seen. He said medium to large tiger and green prawns were selling for between $15 to $20 a kilo. ""That's the lowest prices we've ever sold them, they're going back to 1980 prices,"" Mr Davis said.   ""We've just got to take it — if we don't take that price, we don't sell them."" He said business had picked up in the past two weeks heading into Easter. ""Since late February, early March it's been a hard time for us all,"" he said. ""We'll get through it, we've been through it before.""     The manager of Morgan's Seafood at Scarborough, Julie Hanson, said record low prices were a result of the volume of ocean-caught seafood and low demand. ""There's so much product out there and the demand hasn't been there, we've been able to buy the product at cheaper prices and pass it on,"" she said. ""I've got prawns at only $12.99 a kilo — that hasn't happened since I've been here, and I've been here for 11 years.""   Many seafood markets have adapted to offer takeaway services, with customers required to stand 1.5 metres apart and pay by card to follow social distancing rules.   Local seafood restaurants and suppliers are accepting pre-orders on wholesale products that can be picked up from stores. For people who cannot leave home, several outlets have started delivering fresh produce to nearby residents on top of offering a takeaway service. Some are even offering a drive-through service so customers can call ahead and pick up their order without leaving the car. In North Queensland, Ingham Road Seafood is operating a drive-through service at the Townsville Showgrounds. Owner Mark Partland said the set-up had been embraced by the community. ""There's plenty of product around, but we've just got to get it out the door with the spacing.""   Mr Partland said the closure of so many restaurants down had been a big blow for the wholesale side of his business, but retail sales remained healthy as ever. ""It's really taken me by surprise actually, it's very strong – I haven't seen it this strong for a long time in the retail sector,"" he said. ""Obviously people aren't going out to eat, so maybe they're treating themselves to some seafood as well – and there's not a lot open. ""We're quite lucky … and people are taking advantage of us being open and buying up for Easter.""   In Bundaberg, Red Shed Seafood has markers on the footpath up to the sales window to ensure customers keep a safe distance apart. Owner Marguerite Conroy Mills said it had been a busy few weeks with high demand for frozen seafood. ""We're only to have a few people in the shop at a time so that also means we have less staff as well but we're getting through it as quickly as we can,"" she said.   ""Everyone still wants their fresh seafood so we've been inundated with frozen orders so that people can do a bit of stockpiling. ""There's two sides to our business, the retail side and the wholesale. The wholesale has been heavily impacted. ""The trawlers have been impacted because they're not able to sell onto to restaurants and anything that might go for export,"" Ms Mills said.   Last month, agricultural forecaster ABARES predicted a $389 million fall in the value of the Australian fisheries and aquaculture industries to $2.81 billion.  Commercial fishers across Queensland have been hit both by restaurant closures and the shutdown of export markets. Queensland Seafood Marketers Association president Marshall Betzel said export and domestic markets had plunged.   ""We saw the export market for our products, particularly live lobster and live coral trout into Asia, disappear overnight,"" he said.   Mr Betzel said while domestic demand had improved in the past few weeks, there was uncertainty about what the future held for the commercial sector long-term. ""Unfortunately, post-Easter we'll probably see the domestic market reduce even further,"" he said. ""The commercial catching sector is under enormous pressure … the morale hasn't been the best given the fact there's a lot of uncertainty. ""This has really been just another blow to the industry, but if we can all wait and see how this pans out, hopefully there will be better days to come. ""I'm sure once we're all out and about and these various measure are reduced, people will get out in droves and we'll see consumer demand as good as it ever was for Queensland seafood.""

8,/news/2020-04-09/star-of-the-south-windfarm-to-run-cable-under-farmland/12133166,Star of the South announces cable routes through farmland for Australia's largest offshore windfarm,"Star of the South has released three proposed easements for underground cables through farmland in South Gippsland to connect Australia's first offshore windfarm to the national electricity grid.   The $10 billion windfarm would comprise approximately 250 turbines in the ocean off the Victorian coast and up to 80 kilometres of underground cabling to the Latrobe Valley. Substations would also be built along the cable route. If approved, the 2,000 megawatt windfarm would produce 18 per cent of Victoria's electricity needs, enough power to service 1.2 million homes. In a letter to be sent to affected landholders next week, the company outlines where the three potential easements would come ashore and the private property that would be affected. Landholders, anxious about being reasonably compensated, met last month to discuss their concerns about the disruption to their farm businesses.   Many of them were involved in a bitter battle with National Grid more than a decade ago, when large overhead pylons were built on their farms to allow for the Victoria–Tasmania power connector, Basslink. ""That's partly why we decided to put our cable underground and from day one. We have certainly tried to be very transparent,"" Star of the South chief development officer Erin Coldham said.  One proposed easement brings the cable to land at McGaurans Beach, south of Sale, and follows a 30-metre-wide easement used by Basslink. The other two suggested cable routes start at nearby Reeves Beach. ""We've had to look for relatively flat terrain … and we've also looked at the Old Rosedale Road as a corridor,"" Ms Coldham said. ""But we've got more work to do to narrow that down and come to a preferred option.""   The company has met with about 50 affected landholders, and said compensation offers would be fair and reasonable.

9,/news/2020-04-09/star-of-the-south-windfarm-to-run-cable-under-farmland/12133166,Star of the South announces cable routes through farmland for Australia's largest offshore windfarm,"Star of the South has released three proposed easements for underground cables through farmland in South Gippsland to connect Australia's first offshore windfarm to the national electricity grid.   The $10 billion windfarm would comprise approximately 250 turbines in the ocean off the Victorian coast and up to 80 kilometres of underground cabling to the Latrobe Valley. Substations would also be built along the cable route. If approved, the 2,000 megawatt windfarm would produce 18 per cent of Victoria's electricity needs, enough power to service 1.2 million homes. In a letter to be sent to affected landholders next week, the company outlines where the three potential easements would come ashore and the private property that would be affected. Landholders, anxious about being reasonably compensated, met last month to discuss their concerns about the disruption to their farm businesses.   Many of them were involved in a bitter battle with National Grid more than a decade ago, when large overhead pylons were built on their farms to allow for the Victoria–Tasmania power connector, Basslink. ""That's partly why we decided to put our cable underground and from day one. We have certainly tried to be very transparent,"" Star of the South chief development officer Erin Coldham said.  One proposed easement brings the cable to land at McGaurans Beach, south of Sale, and follows a 30-metre-wide easement used by Basslink. The other two suggested cable routes start at nearby Reeves Beach. ""We've had to look for relatively flat terrain … and we've also looked at the Old Rosedale Road as a corridor,"" Ms Coldham said. ""But we've got more work to do to narrow that down and come to a preferred option.""   The company has met with about 50 affected landholders, and said compensation offers would be fair and reasonable. Landholders would sign an option agreement contract during the planning stage, that gives Star of the South partial rights to the land for an agreed use, price, and time.  That option is taken up and full compensation is paid once the easement is built and registered.

For the owner of Lavandula Swiss Italian Farm in Daylesford, Carol White, now would usually be one of her busiest periods, but due to coronavirus the cash flow has dried up. ""We dramatically closed on the 16th of March when a staff member's wife, who works in the hospital, was quarantined with suspected COVID-19,"" she said. ""This person had been in touch with everybody so it meant everybody had to go home and we had to stop tourists coming on site. ""People had to abandon ship, basically."" Ms White has run the lavender farm for 30 years where she sells therapeutic skincare products and homewares.   Businesses like Lavandula are struggling to work out where they fit in the landscape of support payments — being neither exclusively agriculture or tourism — making it hard to work out where to turn for help. ""We have no income basically because we relied on the farm gate sales,"" she said. ""I'm really wondering how much business we're going to have at the end of six months. How do you restart?"" The Easter holidays are usually one of the farm's busiest times, and Ms White said the halt on tourism will damage the business' bottom line. ""On some days we'd have 200 people come through the gates,"" she said.   ""We're now missing our peak time, which is our winter money."" In addition to the lack of foot traffic, Ms White is worried about how the business will pay for supplies that are likely to go to waste. ""There's thousands of dollars' worth of stock that we've bought — prime goods, things to make scones or jams with, that will just never be used,"" she said. ""It's just sitting there looking at me. So it's a bit depressing and daunting to think 'no income, how do we pay for this?'""   Farm maintenance happens over the slower winter period which is paid for by the usually busy Autumn season. But as Ms White waits in the uncertainty, she must keep working to make up ground for the loss of staff. ""I go to the farm every day and I'm picking up where we left off,"" she said. Lavandula employs approximately ten people in the busy season and Ms White is trying to retain their jobs while balancing the books. ""I haven't been able to keep my staff on until I know exactly what's happening with the JobKeepers subsidy and how that will work, who it will apply to,"" she said.

12,/news/2020-04-09/friend-or-foe-scientists-and-farmers-divided-on-dingoes/12132636,Dingoes divide scientists and farmers over ecological importance,"Some of NSW's top scientists and farmers are at odds when it comes to the importance of dingoes to the state's landscape.   It comes after the New South Wales Threatened Species Scientific Committee said there was not enough evidence to suggest the removal of dingoes would cause a flow-on effect on small mammals or reptiles. The committee has made a preliminary decision to reject a proposal to list the cascading effects of the loss or removal of dingoes from New South Wales landscape as a key threatening process. Committee chair Anne Kerle said it was a divisive issue.   ""It is a very complex issue and research has been carried out to suggest that the removal of a top predator, which is the dingo, means that kangaroo numbers have exploded, damaging the ecology where they live."" Ecologists supporting that claim said the kangaroos went on to damage the ecology of the landscape, prompting a cascade effect on small mammals or reptiles. Dr Kerle said the evidence did not support that claim. ""I think if you look at the determination it says that, while there appears to be conclusive evidence in parts of the state, it doesn't appear to be as conclusive in other parts of the state,"" she said. ""There is also the interaction between dingoes and foxes and feral cats and what that interaction actually means. ""We didn't feel it [the evidence] was solid enough across the state to pursue [the listing] at this stage.""  Dingo management in New South Wales has long been driven by farmers using physical barriers and lethal control. Mitchell Clapham is head of NSW Farmers' Conservation and Resource Management Committee and farms near Mudgee in the state's Central West.   Mr Clapham said it was important farmers kept getting rid of problematic dogs. ""I would think that for once we are in furious agreement with the recommendations that come via the scientific committee here,"" Mr Clapham said. ""We need to be able to continually control the dogs and protect our livestock. ""It is a real issue especially when a dog gets a bit of age, a bit of experience, they can do enormous economic damage to producers and it is nothing to lose 100 or 200 sheep in a year."" Scientists say dingo hotspots in New South Wales include the Washpool National Park, north of Port Macquarie, and the Myall lakes, which is home to the Mungo Brush pack. It is the subject of a current research project aimed at developing non-lethal tools for dingo management.   The work involves fitting dingoes with custom-built satellite GPS collars that record their locations every two hours. The data will allow the scientists to build up an accurate picture of where the dingoes are spending their time, and properly assess potential tools to manage dingo movements. Neil Jordan is a conservation biologist from the University of New South Wales who is head of the project. ""It is basically a field-based project to understand the movements and ecology of dingoes in the Myall Lakes region and to test some potential non-lethal deterrents to stop them predating on livestock,"" he said. Dr Jordan is also a member of the Taronga Conservation Society of Australia and researchers there are developing a scent-based management tool for dingoes and other wild dogs in Australia. The research is based on the premise that dingoes communicate territorial ownership using scent-marks and vocalisations. Dr Jordan said, contrary to what the scientific committee found, he believed that evidence showed the loss of dingoes caused a cascading effect on smaller species in the wild. ""They have a crucial set of ecosystem services that are really important to biodiversity and they contribute to keeping feral animal species down, so foxes and cats,"" he said. He said it was timely to look at dingo management. ""As I said dingoes can have a negative impact on the livestock industry, so it is only right that we should look at potentially managing and reducing those impacts while retaining dingoes in the wild landscape,"" Dr Jordan said. The Australian Ecological Society does not hold back in its defence of dingoes and is fiercely against extreme culling. ""Dingo management parallels persecution of the Tasmanian tiger: a top predator that was hunted for its alleged impact on livestock,"" the society said. ""Dingoes are persecuted for similar reasons to the extinct Tasmanian tiger.""   The society said that persecution had reduced the species' distribution and disrupted its social structure, potentially accelerating the demise of the species through hybridisation with feral domestic dogs.  The society was in favour of non-lethal control measures. ""Alternatives to lethal control and the dingo fence exist, with potential benefits to farmers and biodiversity alike,"" it said. Victoria also rejected listing the loss of the dingo as a key threatening process to the landscape in that state. Back in New South Wales, the head of the scientific committee there, Anne Kerle said she and her colleagues had to weigh up all the evidence before making what she said was an agonising decision. ""Despite there being good evidence that the loss of dingoes could adversely affect some threatened species or ecological communities, there remains a considerable difference of scientific opinion about the complexity of interactions involved,"" she said. But Dr Kerle said the committee would be open to consider a resubmitted proposal if there was more conclusive evidence.",ABC Newcastle      By Giselle Wakatama,"April 09, 2020"

14,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-easter-victorians-told-to-stay-home-this-weekend/12140378,"Coronavirus deaths rise to 13 in Victoria, as millions poured into family violence support services","Victoria's death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 13, as the State Government announces millions to help prevent family violence and move rough sleepers into accommodation.   The number of confirmed cases in the state is now 1,241 after 13 more cases were confirmed overnight. There are now 158 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus, one more than yesterday. There are 43 people in hospital, seven more than yesterday, and 13 people are in intensive care. Another 120 people have recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 926. Police have issued another 98 fines in the past 24 hours to people flouting stage three restrictions, and carried out 754 checks on people who should be in self-isolation.   Elsewhere in the country, a 69-year-old man died from coronavirus complications overnight in New South Wales, bringing the national death toll to 53. The rise in the national death toll comes as 280 Australians have arrived in Melbourne after leaving a number of locations in Peru. They immediately boarded buses and were taken to hotels in the city for two weeks of self-isolation. More Australians stuck in Peru, Argentina and South Africa are expected to be brought home over the next week. The figures come as the Minister for Prevention of Family Violence Gabrielle Williams announced the State Government would invest $40.2 million in crisis accommodation and specialist services for people suffering or at risk of family violence.   The Government will put $20 million towards short-term accommodation for people who do not feel safe isolating or recovering from COVID-19 at home. Another $20.2 million will help family violence services meet the expected increase in demand during the health crisis. The package will include about $5 million for technology and protective equipment and targeted funding will be provided to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. The Government has also announced a plan to help Victorians experiencing homelessness who need to self-isolate. Housing Minister Richard Wynne has announced $8 million will be put towards using decommissioned aged-care homes at four Melbourne locations to house 200 people sleeping rough, and provide them with healthcare.   To be eligible for the program, people must either be waiting on test results, have a positive coronavirus diagnosis, be required to self-isolate but have nowhere to do so, or have been discharged from hospital and require accommodation to recover. ""People without secure accommodation are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they can't self-isolate or quarantine, this will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus,'' Mr Wynne said.   The housing will be operated by Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria with outreach staff providing 24-hour support. Mr Wynne also said public housing tenants' rent assessments would not be affected by any Federal Government financial stimulus payments over the coming months.   As the country gears up for a different kind of Easter, authorities around Australia are pleading with people to remain at home and not travel to regional or coastal areas this weekend. The ban on public gatherings means Victoria's church leaders have had to come up with novel ways to keep their communities connected. St Paul's Anglican Cathedral is streaming Easter services on its Facebook page and YouTube channel, and Temple Beth Israel is continuing to run services through its virtual synagogue on YouTube. The Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne will stream its Easter mass on its website as well as its YouTube channel. On Thursday, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville said police would be checking on travellers on roads and in tourist hotspots to make sure they were complying with coronavirus restrictions. State MP for South Barwon  Darren Cheeseman has called for Surf Coast Shire Council to close all beaches this weekend to deter people from travelling to the coast. ""They should be closed to all activity, including surfing, swimming, fishing, walking, and sunbathing,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Meanwhile, Victorian emergency departments have reported a 20 per cent drop in patients with injuries as the state's stage three lockdown continues. The Department of Health said there had been a reduction from an average of 5,000 patients per day to 4,100 per day. But while there had been an overall drop in the number of people presenting to emergency departments, some areas have seen an unexpected spike during the lockdown.   Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had received ""an influx of patients with severe burns"" from home cooking and barbecuing. ""If you are going to be cooking, please pay attention,"" she said. ""And if you're going to be barbecuing, please, please do not throw accelerants like methylated spirits or petrol onto the fire to try and get it going."" However, hospitals and medical professionals have expressed concern that emergency department numbers might be down because people were delaying vital treatment.   Stroke Foundation chief executive Sharon McGowan said some patients who were worried about being a burden on the health system or contracting COVID-19 at a hospital were not seeking help when they needed it. ""We've already heard from our clinicians on the ground of two cases where individuals with the early signs of stroke actually delayed calling triple zero,"" Ms McGowan said. Ambulance services across Victoria have also seen a 20 per cent drop in emergency calls prompting Ms McGowan to urge Australians not to play down medical emergencies during the pandemic. ""We must be looking after ourselves in Australia. Every stroke is a medical emergency, every stroke is a triple zero call.""    ",,"April 10, 2020"
15,/news/2020-04-10/gardening-australia-costa-georgiadis-tips-for-covid-19-isolation/12132902,Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis shares four tips for living in coronavirus isolation,"Costa Georgiadis's chooks are pretty happy right now. Like the rest of Australia, the gardening guru is spending a lot more time at home and, unsurprisingly, in his backyard. ""They're spending a lot more time in the broader garden and actually out on the street as I do work on my street garden,"" he said. ""Their definition of lockdown is free range."" These are troubling times, but for Costa there is ""a big silver lining"", and that's seeing how many people are getting back into their gardens.   So to help you make the most of it, Costa has some ideas on everything from what to plant now to how many chooks you can have (if you can find them), and what to do if you live in an apartment. First of all, Costa wants you to just take a moment to get to know your garden.   ""It's really such a special time in the sense that without the pressures of having to go anywhere, there's this chance to slow down,"" he said. ""One of the smallest and simplest things from a gardening point of view is to actually go out into your garden and just observe what's going on."" It might sound basic, but Costa says most of the time we're just moving through the space — taking the bins out or watering the plants while staring at our phones. So he wants you to try these simple ideas: In other words, look at your garden as a living thing, rather than just a space. ""I talk to children about doing that, but I equally share it with adults because there's so much going on in our gardens that we tend to miss,"" Costa said. There are a lot of things that can go into the ground at the moment. The typically cooler parts of the country haven't yet become too cold, and the hotter northern areas are now starting to become more mild. ""So there's this wonderful, almost spring window,"" Costa said.  ""As far as gardening goes and growing, this is one of the prime slots similar to when we come out in in early spring."" Here are a few options to plant now:   Some of these are quick turnaround and you will be able to start ""repeat havesting"" within 30-50 days. That is, picking off outer leaves and leaving the rest to continue growing. Then you can turn to longer-term vegetables like snow peas, broad beans, broccoli and cauliflower.  ""There's things that we can wait for the full term and there's other things that we can harvest along the way, and those salad greens are a great place to start,"" Costa said. A lack of space doesn't have to mean a lack of garden, and there is still plenty you can grow. Just get experimental, Costa says.   ""Get your celery or your spinach or even your Asian greens, cut them off from the base with about two centimetres or so, then put them on the window sill in a little bit of water,"" he said. ""Things like spring onions — and I've got it going on at the moment with some silverbeet — they'll reshoot and you can literally watch them start growing from the central core. ""Then once they get up a bit and you see little roots you can go out and plant them into the soil and it's just a nice little project."" Other things you can grow in jars on your window sill include mung beans and lentils. Costa says there's no shortage of online tutorials for sprouts. ""That's a great little science project for the kids.""   Costa's chooks like a bit of gardening themselves, especially when he tries to put the mulch out. ""They didn't go to the school of colouring in between the lines, they spread the mulch outside the garden beds,"" he said. ""But hey, they're happy.""   If you're looking to buy some chickens, chances are you're not alone. At the same time there was a run on toilet paper, chicken breeders around the country were also being inundated. If you do want to get some chooks consider how you will keep them. ""You can have a pre-made coop and some of them come on wheels, so you can actually move them across the yard so that they're not fixed in one point,"" Costa said.   In terms of space, Costa says a smaller coop is OK as long as the chickens have space they can be let out to roam around in. About 10 square metres is a good guide. ""That would be enough to have a couple of chickens, and it's always nice to have two rather than one so they've got some company,"" he said.    ",ABC News Breakfast,"April 10, 2020"
16,/news/2020-04-09/victoria-coronavirus-cases-rise/12135968,"Coronavirus cases in Victoria rise to 1,228 as police urge people to stay home for Easter","Cases of coronavirus in Victoria have risen to 1,228 after 16 more people were diagnosed with COVID-19 overnight.   Fifty people are in hospital including 13 people in intensive care, up from 12 who were in intensive care on Wednesday. The number of deaths remains at 12. Police Minister Lisa Neville urged people to stay at home this weekend and away from coastal communities, but conceded that legally people could visit holiday homes they owned.  ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said.  ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you."" Ms Neville said Victoria Police would be visiting coastal and regional communities making sure people were complying with coronavirus restrictions, and would be out on the roads doing road safety checks.   Ms Neville said where there were ""blatant"" breaches of the Chief Health Officer's rules, people would be fined. ""These are really tough measures, we all understand that this will be a very different Easter and it should be,"" she said.   Ms Neville said some beaches had closed completely while some had closed but were still allowing people to surf, swim and walk for exercise if they lived locally. ""Travelling from Melbourne to Lorne to surf is inappropriate,"" she said.   Police carried out 1,065 spot checks in 24 hours and issued another 78 on-the-spot fines. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the main reason fines were being issued was because people continued to gather together. ""They're still doing dinner parties, Airbnb-type parties, large groups of people together. We're having people drink in the streets, drink outside with a group of mates in parks and things like that,"" he said. ""Totally unacceptable behaviour.""   Victoria Police fined a man understood to be a member of an ultra-orthodox Jewish community for holding a group prayer session in Ripponlea in Melbourne's south-east.   In a statement, police said the man was fined $1,652 for failing to adhere to directives designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Police said they had also attended the same premises on Wednesday and issued several warnings ""to a person about organising and holding gatherings."" The other men who were at the venue were being investigated and further fines may be issued. Other examples of people who were fined included a man driving in South Melbourne who claimed he was out to buy a bottle of water, despite living in Wantirna South, and a group of six who had gathered together after previously being warned by police. The group of six told police they were ""just chilling"".   But while some breaches may be obvious, Victorian crossbenchers are calling for a review of some of the most draconian regulations, including directions prohibiting people sitting alone in public spaces and going fishing. The Reason Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens said many of the restrictions around solitary activities needed to be fine-tuned to make them sustainable for the long-term. Deputy Commissioner Patton admitted police were also fining offenders who were caught breaking criminal laws — a practice that has been criticised by lawyers. ""When we're charging them for offences such as drugs, burglary and theft they're also getting infringements issued to them,"" he said. The Deputy Commissioner said officers had been instructed to focus on breaches that were ""deliberate, blatant and obvious"" and assured people there were ""checks and balances"" in place. ""We're not perfect police officers, we will get this wrong on some occasions but when we get it wrong we'll fix it and that's what we're about,"" he said. Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson has called for roadblocks to be put in place along Victoria's Great Ocean Road to stop holiday-makers from breaching coronavirus restrictions. Under the stage three shutdown, people are legally allowed to travel to properties they own. Ms Henderson told the ABC those who were travelling illegitimately could be fined and forced to turn around.  ""There are still Airbnbs and rental homes out there on the market, which is of course prohibited,"" she said.   Ms Neville said the Chief Health Officer had not indicated there was a need for roadblocks to stop people travelling to the regions and the coast, saying she had a ""great deal of faith in Victorians"". Airbnb Australia country manager Susan Wheeldon said the company would cooperate with police on any investigations into non-essential travel. ""If you're thinking of an Easter getaway this long weekend, change your plans immediately and stay home,"" she said in a statement. ""Airbnb is extremely serious about supporting efforts to combat COVID-19."" Ms Wheeldon said the company had contacted hosts and guests to remind them to comply with local laws and had been ""actively discouraging"" hosts from inappropriately marketing listings using terms related to COVID-19, such as quarantine. ""We won't hesitate to take action, such as removal from our platform, against anyone who violates the policies we've put in place to help ensure the public's safety,"" she said.   Operation Nexus will continue this year over the Easter long weekend with an increased focus on breath testing, drug testing, and speed but booze buses will not be operating. Road Policing Assistant Commissioner Libby Murphy said rather than roadblocks, police would be focusing on enforcement and visibility. Ms Neville also said it was too early to speculate on when AFL should come back, saying it was ""way too early"" to lift restrictions. The Department of Transport has closed boat ramps, piers and jetties across Victoria in a bid to reinforce that all forms of recreational boating were not permitted under stage three restrictions. It comes after a man had to be rescued by police on Wednesday night after he crashed into rocks near Portsea while trying to reach Tasmania.   Recreational boating includes all forms of human-powered boating, including canoeing, kayaking, surf skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, rowing, all forms of powered boating such as jet skiing and all forms of wind-powered boating such as yachting, kitesurfing and windsurfing. Commercial shipping, commercial boating, land, port and waterway management functions and emergency access are exempt. Meanwhile, a significantly higher number of calls are being made to the Victoria Police assistance line. More than 600 calls are being made a day from people reporting others who breach physical-distancing rules.   Over the last two weeks, 22,500 coronavirus-related calls have been made, including 3,781 calls to report mass gatherings, 2,117 for people suspected of breaching social-isolation protocols and 1,770 for businesses breaching the restrictions. In February, the assistance line received about 61,000 calls, which was consistent with average call volumes in previous months. But in March that figure blew out to 69,000 — the highest number of calls per month since the police line launched in July last year. The line is likely to receive 80,000 calls by the end of April. Last Friday, 1,000 calls to the hotline were redirected to the DHHS website or the National Coronavirus Helpline because they were general enquiries.  ",,"April 09, 2020"
17,/news/2020-04-08/women-in-agriculture-show-girls-make-great-farmers/12130138,Father stunned by response after asking for help convincing his daughter that girls are farmers too,"A father of three girls on a farm in Western Australia's wheat belt has been inundated with uplifting messages about women in agriculture. Ty Fulwood was unpacking a travel bag with his oldest daughter, three-year-old Sylvie, when she made a surprising comment. She had playfully asked him if he would share his work clothes.   He took it as a sign she was thinking about a future working on the farm. ""Are you going to help Daddy when you get older and be a farmer?"" he asked. Her response stunned him. ""No daddy, I'm not going to be a farmer,"" she insisted. ""I'm a girl not a boy."" He realised that despite creating a supportive environment for his daughters, they didn't see many females working on the farm and that had created a perception in their young minds that women don't work in agriculture. ""For her at three-and-a-half to think that it wasn't an option because she was a girl just really stumped me,"" Mr Fulwood said. Mr Fulwood, who runs a cropping operation growing wheat and canola in Cunderdin, 150 kilometres east of Perth, wanted to show his daughters examples of female farmers. But because of coronavirus restrictions couldn't do it in person. So he took to Twitter. Hundreds of people have responded with videos and photos of life on the land.   ""I thought I might get a couple of responses but it was quite a large response,"" he said. Some people shared videos, directed to Sylvie, explaining why they had a passion for agriculture.   Others shared images of themselves or their daughters and wives getting busy on the farm, helping with lambing, feeding livestock or working with heavy machinery. Western Australian wool producer Emily Stretch shared a video of feeding time. ""I filled the feeder using the auger and reversed the trailer no worries,"" Ms Stretch said. ""Girls can do anything they put their mind to, so can guys!"" In northern Queensland, Kate Andison and her four sisters all consider themselves farmers. ""Our parents are farmers and we all work together at home on our family cattle property,"" Ms Andison said. ""They are very proud and happy that girls can be farmers and work in our family's business. You can do what ever you want to and remember that girls make the best farmers.""   UK farmer Eleanor Durdy said farming wasn't just a man's world. ""They have a female farmer emoji, so it must be true!"" said Ms Durdy, highlighting the importance of making women in agriculture more visible. Mr Fulwood said his next challenge was to keep his young daughter's attention while showing her the many videos and stories sent her way.   He added that he would keep the Twitter thread for future use when his daughters are a bit older. ""There were so many positive responses and from what I saw there were so many responses from men and women,"" Mr Fulwood said. ""I think it's an issue that affects all of us and we are all trying to manage.""   He said agriculture was slow to change partly because inter-generational farms don't change hands very often. ""I only came back to the farm at 30 after a life in the city and a few things hit home with me about gender roles and attitudes to change,"" he said. ""I find it very good to see men and women sharing and commenting and contributing to the conversation.""",Landline      By                                 Margot Kelly,"April 08, 2020"
18,/news/2020-04-08/high-regional-wa-fuel-prices-prompt-inquiry-call/12129408,"City fuel prices fall to decade-long lows but regional bowsers remain high, prompting calls for inquiry","While Perth residents are celebrating fuel at low prices not seen in more than a decade, the savings are not being passed on to those in regional Western Australia.    Global oil prices have been falling since December due to a price war between large producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, together with the drop in demand due to COVID-19 shutdowns.  It has made a big difference at the bowser for those in Perth and southern parts of the state with the average price of unleaded fuel on Tuesday at 93.5 cents a litre (c/l) and as low as 84.9c/l.   But four hours north in Geraldton, motorists are paying about 40 cents a litre more at 131.9-139.9c/l with very similar prices in the Goldfields. FuelWatch manager Ben Derecki says Perth drivers are benefiting from competition and a regular fuel cycle which does not apply in country areas. He said it could take up to six weeks for the falling prices to be reflected in some parts of the state as they use up fuel stores. In the Goldfields-Esperance region, Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler said residents expect to pay more given the 600-kilometre journey to transport fuel from Perth to the mining city. ""Normally we're 8-10 cents dearer than Perth,"" he said. ""But right now it is ludicrous, it is wrong, and we're being gouged by the fuel companies or the service stations. I suspect it's the fuel companies."" Since the Yellowdine Roadhouse reopened in December, the blink-and-you-miss-it stopover on the Great Eastern Highway has been regularly selling unleaded fuel 20-25c/l cheaper than Kalgoorlie-Boulder's cheapest station, 200km to the east. ""Now if they can do it at Yellowdine … why can't others?"" Mr Bowler said. ""Right now it's the biggest gap I've ever seen between Perth fuel prices and Kalgoorlie.  ""The fuel companies and service stations are taking us for granted and we've got to turn the battle back onto them."" The discount at the bowser is also being felt at the WA-South Australian border, where the price of unleaded petrol has fallen from 182 to 159c/l in the fortnight since new border restrictions were imposed. The price of diesel at the border was $1.72 on Tuesday. Geraldton MP Ian Blayney has called for a parliamentary inquiry.  He said an independent committee could take a ""good, hard look at how the fuel pricing system works in Western Australia"". ""You can't explain it. When you look at where our fuel comes from it's all big service stations along the highway there,"" he said. ""The line 'we've got to refill them monthly and so we have to sell the older product', well, that just doesn't wash because they fill up their tanks all the time. We know that because we drive past and see the tankers there.""   Mr Blayney said an independent committee could provide increased transparency to the industry. ""Depending on how much information you can get out of them,"" he said. ""You can go to the courts and demand information from them and you can guarantee you'll have a fight with them because they don't like handing any information over to you. ""But you can try and make them justify what's happening."" Mr Blayney stopped short of saying he would push for legislation to limit prices. ""[But] this is wrong, it's not working the way it should be working, and consumers in a place like Geraldton … are obviously just paying through the nose"". Heather Jones from trucking company Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls rejected the suggestion fuel companies were using fuel stores before passing on the savings, describing it as ""price gouging"".   ""On these high-volume traffic routes I absolutely think they would have gone through their fuel stocks in the last three weeks,"" she said.  ""We have an awesome local independent distributor in Karratha who fills up our fuel tanks between 10 and 13 cents below the pump price up here."" In other Pilbara towns, the Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls pay pump price in places like Newman, Port Hedland, Tom Price, Paraburdoo, or Onslow. Their business can use up to 1,800 litres in two days per truck, so it adds up very quickly. In WA's Kimberley meanwhile, the two major fuel retailers at Kununurra were selling unleaded and diesel at around just under 143c/l. However, local independent fuel provider Cambridge Gulf Limited (CGI) directly imports fuel into Wyndham Port, offering it almost 15c/l cheaper at their self-service station in town.   Chief executive Tony Chafer said it was extremely challenging to compete with prices in metropolitan areas, in part due to a significant drop in demand. He said many factors influence prices, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a huge reduction in Kimberley customers. ""Our demand usually peaks through the tourist season and that's non-existent now, so we're really limited to supplying fuel into the local community,"" he said. ""All of our fixed costs are going to stay exactly the same. ""One of the other challenges that all fuel providers up here face is there's restriction on vessels coming to ports in terms of quarantine periods.  ""Those vessels are quite expensive when they're sitting off at anchor, so that also has to be factored into the price of fuel as an additional cost.  ""I can certainly understand why some fuel providers in country WA are finding it tough to drop their price given their fixed costs are still there and revenue has dropped significantly."" Mr Chafer said there would likely be a delay before fuel prices drop in remote areas. He said his company's fuel was sourced from Singapore, meaning it would take a few weeks for prices to stabilise in Kununurra.   ""The price drop we've just passed on, that's the most we can put on at the moment because we buy our fuel on a monthly Singapore average,"" he said. ""That means the monthly average of all the fuel traded in Singapore for the previous month, and because the fuel price has been in a bit of a freefall there's a fair degree of difference between the monthly average and the last day of the month. ""In the coming months when we re-price in May, we will have the potential to actually bring the price down a little bit further as well."" Mr Chafer estimated that since opening their independent fuel terminal two years ago, CGl had taken about 20c/l off the price of local fuel in Kununurra. The message from FuelWatch Manager Ben Derecki is to shop around in locations where that is possible.

But four hours north in Geraldton, motorists are paying about 40 cents a litre more at 131.9-139.9c/l with very similar prices in the Goldfields. FuelWatch manager Ben Derecki says Perth drivers are benefiting from competition and a regular fuel cycle which does not apply in country areas. He said it could take up to six weeks for the falling prices to be reflected in some parts of the state as they use up fuel stores. In the Goldfields-Esperance region, Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler said residents expect to pay more given the 600-kilometre journey to transport fuel from Perth to the mining city. ""Normally we're 8-10 cents dearer than Perth,"" he said. ""But right now it is ludicrous, it is wrong, and we're being gouged by the fuel companies or the service stations. I suspect it's the fuel companies."" Since the Yellowdine Roadhouse reopened in December, the blink-and-you-miss-it stopover on the Great Eastern Highway has been regularly selling unleaded fuel 20-25c/l cheaper than Kalgoorlie-Boulder's cheapest station, 200km to the east. ""Now if they can do it at Yellowdine … why can't others?"" Mr Bowler said. ""Right now it's the biggest gap I've ever seen between Perth fuel prices and Kalgoorlie.  ""The fuel companies and service stations are taking us for granted and we've got to turn the battle back onto them."" The discount at the bowser is also being felt at the WA-South Australian border, where the price of unleaded petrol has fallen from 182 to 159c/l in the fortnight since new border restrictions were imposed. The price of diesel at the border was $1.72 on Tuesday. Geraldton MP Ian Blayney has called for a parliamentary inquiry.  He said an independent committee could take a ""good, hard look at how the fuel pricing system works in Western Australia"". ""You can't explain it. When you look at where our fuel comes from it's all big service stations along the highway there,"" he said. ""The line 'we've got to refill them monthly and so we have to sell the older product', well, that just doesn't wash because they fill up their tanks all the time. We know that because we drive past and see the tankers there.""   Mr Blayney said an independent committee could provide increased transparency to the industry. ""Depending on how much information you can get out of them,"" he said. ""You can go to the courts and demand information from them and you can guarantee you'll have a fight with them because they don't like handing any information over to you. ""But you can try and make them justify what's happening."" Mr Blayney stopped short of saying he would push for legislation to limit prices. ""[But] this is wrong, it's not working the way it should be working, and consumers in a place like Geraldton … are obviously just paying through the nose"". Heather Jones from trucking company Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls rejected the suggestion fuel companies were using fuel stores before passing on the savings, describing it as ""price gouging"".   ""On these high-volume traffic routes I absolutely think they would have gone through their fuel stocks in the last three weeks,"" she said.  ""We have an awesome local independent distributor in Karratha who fills up our fuel tanks between 10 and 13 cents below the pump price up here."" In other Pilbara towns, the Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls pay pump price in places like Newman, Port Hedland, Tom Price, Paraburdoo, or Onslow. Their business can use up to 1,800 litres in two days per truck, so it adds up very quickly. In WA's Kimberley meanwhile, the two major fuel retailers at Kununurra were selling unleaded and diesel at around just under 143c/l. However, local independent fuel provider Cambridge Gulf Limited (CGI) directly imports fuel into Wyndham Port, offering it almost 15c/l cheaper at their self-service station in town.   Chief executive Tony Chafer said it was extremely challenging to compete with prices in metropolitan areas, in part due to a significant drop in demand. He said many factors influence prices, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a huge reduction in Kimberley customers. ""Our demand usually peaks through the tourist season and that's non-existent now, so we're really limited to supplying fuel into the local community,"" he said. ""All of our fixed costs are going to stay exactly the same. ""One of the other challenges that all fuel providers up here face is there's restriction on vessels coming to ports in terms of quarantine periods.  ""Those vessels are quite expensive when they're sitting off at anchor, so that also has to be factored into the price of fuel as an additional cost.  ""I can certainly understand why some fuel providers in country WA are finding it tough to drop their price given their fixed costs are still there and revenue has dropped significantly."" Mr Chafer said there would likely be a delay before fuel prices drop in remote areas. He said his company's fuel was sourced from Singapore, meaning it would take a few weeks for prices to stabilise in Kununurra.   ""The price drop we've just passed on, that's the most we can put on at the moment because we buy our fuel on a monthly Singapore average,"" he said. ""That means the monthly average of all the fuel traded in Singapore for the previous month, and because the fuel price has been in a bit of a freefall there's a fair degree of difference between the monthly average and the last day of the month. ""In the coming months when we re-price in May, we will have the potential to actually bring the price down a little bit further as well."" Mr Chafer estimated that since opening their independent fuel terminal two years ago, CGl had taken about 20c/l off the price of local fuel in Kununurra. The message from FuelWatch Manager Ben Derecki is to shop around in locations where that is possible. ""Use the FuelWatch website and shop around to put pressure onto the distributors,"" he said.",ABC Mid West & Wheatbelt      By staff reporters,"April 08, 2020"
23,/news/2020-04-08/outback-lessons-on-how-to-deal-with-coronavirus-isolation/12129896,Coronavirus self-isolation experts: How western Queensland can teach us a thing or two about isolation,"For families right across Australia, the past week has been spent getting used to the new normal — school at home, limited visitors, and only essential outings. But for families in isolated communities and properties in regional and rural Queensland, it is business as usual. Riley O'Dell is like any other 12-year-old girl. She wakes up in the morning and gets ready for school, and has chores and animals to look after. The only difference is that when Riley goes to school of a morning she does not leave her house. Riley has lived on Toarbee Station, just outside Jericho in western Queensland, her whole life and she has been doing School of the Air since she was five years old. While families right across the state adapt to school at home, Riley said not much has changed for her in the past few weeks. ""I'm used to it I guess and it's easy, like I've done it since prep, so I guess I'm just used to it,"" Riley said. Riley said School of the Air is not that different from going to a physical school.  She has teachers and classmates, she loves maths but hates economics, and she loves playing with her animals during lunch to keep her energised during the day.     ""What I do is just have things around the house that I muck around with and play with and at smoko, I run out to the tramp, probably chase my dogs a bit, and play on the tramp for about half an hour before I go back on air,"" Riley said. ""For lunchtime, if the horse is up, I'll go out and play with the horses, go over and see the bulls, play on the trampoline, and just try and do things."" And while Riley's life may have remained the same her mum, Jacky, said she can sympathise with parents who have never experienced teaching their kids from home.   ""It's scary at first,"" Ms O'Dell said. ""When she first started prep I was really scared about how I could cope with teaching her, but the teachers are great and it's all been terrific. ""It will be hard for people that aren't used to it … but they've got to make sure the kids get into a routine straight away.""     It is not just learning to cope with the new way of life we are all adapting to.  Experts say it is important that people in isolation take care of their mental wellbeing during this uncertain time. Royal Flying Doctor Services Outback Mental Health clinical lead, Tim Driscoll, has worked with geographically isolated people and graziers dealing with drought for many years. Dr Driscoll said the advice he gives those people is the same advice he now gives to clients that are not used to the isolation. ""Really, people in more remote parts of Queensland and Australia have been dealing with social isolation for some time, they are certainly well-practised at this,"" he said. ""So the advice is very much the same in terms of maintaining those social networks — and we don't necessarily need to be right together to maintain a connection. ""We can use the telephone, we can use Facetime, we can use Skype, we can use those other technologies to maintain our social lives and make sure those social networks remain strong.  ""And that's really whether it's isolation due to geography or it's isolation due to reducing the risk of COVID-19. It is the same challenge, so the advice is very consistent. It's about maintaining connections through whatever means are available.""   Another way to boost your morale while in isolation is to keep active and fit, according to outback fitness guru Joy McClymont.   Ms McClymont started Off The Track Training 12 years ago after she moved to a property 100 kilometres west of Longreach and found that exercising alone was demotivating and boring. She now runs online fitness sessions with more than 2,000 clients and has helped isolated women keep fit using phone calls, emails, or live workout sessions. ""I know that a lot of people are really struggling in trying to adjust to the new ways in which they've got to live, essentially,"" Ms McClymont said.    ""What my best advice would be, is to always prioritise movement in your day. ""So one of the things I used to love doing was picking a spot in my house and every time I walked past it, I had to do 10 push-ups.  ""It was things like that that brought a bit of spice to my day. The kids got on board with it, we integrated fitness into our lives and it didn't feel like this thing that had to be fussy and time-consuming and precious.""

37,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-queensland-seafood-sales-easter-cheap/12129506,Coronavirus lockdown sees prawns drop to 1980 prices ahead of Easter splurge,"Seafood suppliers, fish markets and trawlers have been hit hard by the impacts of coronavirus but Queenslanders' love of seafood and unusually low prices have given the industry a temporary boost.   Normally seafood suppliers are gearing up for one of the busiest times of the year, but this Easter long queues and huge volumes of pre-orders have been replaced with takeaway services and home deliveries. Prawn trawler Daryl Davis, based at Shorncliffe on Brisbane's bayside, said consumers would benefit with freshly caught prawns at the lowest prices he had ever seen. He said medium to large tiger and green prawns were selling for between $15 to $20 a kilo. ""That's the lowest prices we've ever sold them, they're going back to 1980 prices,"" Mr Davis said.   ""We've just got to take it — if we don't take that price, we don't sell them."" He said business had picked up in the past two weeks heading into Easter. ""Since late February, early March it's been a hard time for us all,"" he said. ""We'll get through it, we've been through it before.""     The manager of Morgan's Seafood at Scarborough, Julie Hanson, said record low prices were a result of the volume of ocean-caught seafood and low demand. ""There's so much product out there and the demand hasn't been there, we've been able to buy the product at cheaper prices and pass it on,"" she said. ""I've got prawns at only $12.99 a kilo — that hasn't happened since I've been here, and I've been here for 11 years.""   Many seafood markets have adapted to offer takeaway services, with customers required to stand 1.5 metres apart and pay by card to follow social distancing rules.   Local seafood restaurants and suppliers are accepting pre-orders on wholesale products that can be picked up from stores. For people who cannot leave home, several outlets have started delivering fresh produce to nearby residents on top of offering a takeaway service. Some are even offering a drive-through service so customers can call ahead and pick up their order without leaving the car. In North Queensland, Ingham Road Seafood is operating a drive-through service at the Townsville Showgrounds. Owner Mark Partland said the set-up had been embraced by the community. ""There's plenty of product around, but we've just got to get it out the door with the spacing.""   Mr Partland said the closure of so many restaurants down had been a big blow for the wholesale side of his business, but retail sales remained healthy as ever. ""It's really taken me by surprise actually, it's very strong – I haven't seen it this strong for a long time in the retail sector,"" he said. ""Obviously people aren't going out to eat, so maybe they're treating themselves to some seafood as well – and there's not a lot open. ""We're quite lucky … and people are taking advantage of us being open and buying up for Easter.""   In Bundaberg, Red Shed Seafood has markers on the footpath up to the sales window to ensure customers keep a safe distance apart. Owner Marguerite Conroy Mills said it had been a busy few weeks with high demand for frozen seafood. ""We're only to have a few people in the shop at a time so that also means we have less staff as well but we're getting through it as quickly as we can,"" she said.   ""Everyone still wants their fresh seafood so we've been inundated with frozen orders so that people can do a bit of stockpiling. ""There's two sides to our business, the retail side and the wholesale. The wholesale has been heavily impacted. ""The trawlers have been impacted because they're not able to sell onto to restaurants and anything that might go for export,"" Ms Mills said.   Last month, agricultural forecaster ABARES predicted a $389 million fall in the value of the Australian fisheries and aquaculture industries to $2.81 billion.  Commercial fishers across Queensland have been hit both by restaurant closures and the shutdown of export markets. Queensland Seafood Marketers Association president Marshall Betzel said export and domestic markets had plunged.   ""We saw the export market for our products, particularly live lobster and live coral trout into Asia, disappear overnight,"" he said.   Mr Betzel said while domestic demand had improved in the past few weeks, there was uncertainty about what the future held for the commercial sector long-term. ""Unfortunately, post-Easter we'll probably see the domestic market reduce even further,"" he said. ""The commercial catching sector is under enormous pressure … the morale hasn't been the best given the fact there's a lot of uncertainty. ""This has really been just another blow to the industry, but if we can all wait and see how this pans out, hopefully there will be better days to come. ""I'm sure once we're all out and about and these various measure are reduced, people will get out in droves and we'll see consumer demand as good as it ever was for Queensland seafood.""

38,/news/2020-04-08/high-regional-wa-fuel-prices-prompt-inquiry-call/12129408,"City fuel prices fall to decade-long lows but regional bowsers remain high, prompting calls for inquiry","While Perth residents are celebrating fuel at low prices not seen in more than a decade, the savings are not being passed on to those in regional Western Australia.    Global oil prices have been falling since December due to a price war between large producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, together with the drop in demand due to COVID-19 shutdowns.  It has made a big difference at the bowser for those in Perth and southern parts of the state with the average price of unleaded fuel on Tuesday at 93.5 cents a litre (c/l) and as low as 84.9c/l.   But four hours north in Geraldton, motorists are paying about 40 cents a litre more at 131.9-139.9c/l with very similar prices in the Goldfields. FuelWatch manager Ben Derecki says Perth drivers are benefiting from competition and a regular fuel cycle which does not apply in country areas. He said it could take up to six weeks for the falling prices to be reflected in some parts of the state as they use up fuel stores. In the Goldfields-Esperance region, Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler said residents expect to pay more given the 600-kilometre journey to transport fuel from Perth to the mining city. ""Normally we're 8-10 cents dearer than Perth,"" he said. ""But right now it is ludicrous, it is wrong, and we're being gouged by the fuel companies or the service stations. I suspect it's the fuel companies."" Since the Yellowdine Roadhouse reopened in December, the blink-and-you-miss-it stopover on the Great Eastern Highway has been regularly selling unleaded fuel 20-25c/l cheaper than Kalgoorlie-Boulder's cheapest station, 200km to the east. ""Now if they can do it at Yellowdine … why can't others?"" Mr Bowler said. ""Right now it's the biggest gap I've ever seen between Perth fuel prices and Kalgoorlie.  ""The fuel companies and service stations are taking us for granted and we've got to turn the battle back onto them."" The discount at the bowser is also being felt at the WA-South Australian border, where the price of unleaded petrol has fallen from 182 to 159c/l in the fortnight since new border restrictions were imposed. The price of diesel at the border was $1.72 on Tuesday. Geraldton MP Ian Blayney has called for a parliamentary inquiry.

""On these high-volume traffic routes I absolutely think they would have gone through their fuel stocks in the last three weeks,"" she said.  ""We have an awesome local independent distributor in Karratha who fills up our fuel tanks between 10 and 13 cents below the pump price up here."" In other Pilbara towns, the Pilbara Heavy Haulage Girls pay pump price in places like Newman, Port Hedland, Tom Price, Paraburdoo, or Onslow. Their business can use up to 1,800 litres in two days per truck, so it adds up very quickly. In WA's Kimberley meanwhile, the two major fuel retailers at Kununurra were selling unleaded and diesel at around just under 143c/l. However, local independent fuel provider Cambridge Gulf Limited (CGI) directly imports fuel into Wyndham Port, offering it almost 15c/l cheaper at their self-service station in town.   Chief executive Tony Chafer said it was extremely challenging to compete with prices in metropolitan areas, in part due to a significant drop in demand.

""In the coming months when we re-price in May, we will have the potential to actually bring the price down a little bit further as well."" Mr Chafer estimated that since opening their independent fuel terminal two years ago, CGl had taken about 20c/l off the price of local fuel in Kununurra.

39,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-queensland-close-gold-coast-beaches/12124840,"Coronavirus pandemic to close Gold Coast beaches, Ekka cancelled","Several major beaches on Queensland's Gold Coast will be off limits from Tuesday at midnight due to coronavirus concerns.   Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said while locals were doing the right thing, there had been some visitors at beaches not following social-distancing rules. ""Unfortunately, over the weekend, out-of-towners are descending on the Gold Coast in mass numbers and I fear that this number will increase over the Easter weekend,"" he said. ""Therefore, as of midnight on Tuesday, The Spit, Surfers Paradise and Coolangatta beaches will be closed [to everyone].""   Councillor Tate said other beaches would remain open for Gold Coast residents only. ""I say to Logan and Brisbane people, we love you, but we don't want you visiting us right now,"" the Mayor said. ""The beaches will remain open for our locals so that they can continue to walk and exercise.   ""We are working through the finer details now, including having parking officers redeployed to the Spit to monitor illegal parking up there. ""I didn't want to do this but over the weekend it showed me that especially people visiting from Brisbane are not listening to us."" Cr Tate said more beaches would be closed if people continued to ignore public health orders. ""I will absolutely close more if people think this is not for real,"" he said. ""The curve is starting to flatten and this is not the time to relax and let it bounce back — we have to just kill it off."" Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said beaches would be ""heavily patrolled"" by police. ""Not only those beaches [that have been closed] — all of the beaches as we go into Easter weekend,"" she said.   Commissioner Carroll said people who owned holiday homes should remain at their ""principal residence"". ""Technically if it's non-essential travel, it's not complying … you should not be on the road,"" she said. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk reiterated people were not to treat the Easter break as a holiday. ""It's not the time to pack up and take your family to the beach — there is no holiday this year,"" Ms Palaszczuk said.   Councillor Tate said while some Gold Coast hotels and accommodation providers were experiencing high volumes of cancellations, it showed people were listening to messaging to stay home. ""They're [tourism industry] hurting out there — it's just one of those things when a disaster hits, different sectors hurt and feel things differently,"" he said.   ""But my focus is on the health of our population. Compensation or any other things, I'll leave that for the Prime Minister to consider. ""When we ask people to stay in their suburb, it means don't come [to] stay on the Gold Coast. ""My heart feels for people in hospitality but if we don't do it, the longer-term effect is more devastation for our city."" Gold Coast holiday building manager Marion Simon said their occupancy rate for holiday letting had dropped to zero. ""We've literally gone from being 100 per cent booked to nobody,"" Ms Simon said. ""It hasn't only affected April, it has affected going forward as well, because obviously people don't know what is going to happen, when it's going to happen, if it's going to happen."" Ms Simon said the tough restrictions had been a ""massive problem"" for businesses who relied on busy holiday periods. ""The people taking the most flak are the business and the owners, because they still have bonds to pay and loans to pay, but they don't have any income,"" she said.   Queensland Tourism Industry Council (QTIC) chief executive officer Daniel Gschwind said the industry continued to be hit hard by coronavirus pandemic. ""It is pretty catastrophic — for most businesses in our industry it has really come to a complete standstill,"" he said. ""It started off with the Chinese market collapsing around us, then the international market stopped completely and now, as we all know, the domestic market has also — for all intents and purposes — completely stopped. ""It's a really bitter disappointment for many operators who were hoping that the domestic market over Easter would deliver some relief. That's not going to happen now, so many business will be on a long, hard road to recovery."" Ms Gschwind said once the public health orders were lifted after the coronavirus pandemic, the industry would focus on domestic markets. ""They will be certainly financially emaciated — there will be very little capital to get things going again,"" Mr Gschwind said. ""The international market will take a very long time to recover no doubt, so the domestic market — in whatever shape it's in — will be where we will focus and that's where businesses will have to focus.""     Meanwhile Brisbane's Royal Queensland show, the Ekka, was cancelled today due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland (RNA) chief executive, Brendan Christou, said this was only the third time in history the annual event, due to be held in August, would not go ahead. ""The first was in 1919 with the Spanish Influenza, the second one was in World War II, and the third of course in 2020 because of COVID-19,"" he said. ""We originally thought we might make this decision in June but a day in this current situation is like a week. ""We thought it fair to our exhibitors, to our sponsors and to our volunteers to bring that decision to give them notice.""   Mr Christou said at this stage some animal competitions could still go ahead. ""They don't breach any social-distancing requirements and that is things like our feedlot competitions, and there might be one or two others like beef or carcass competitions that can go ahead this year,"" he said. ""It is sad, we've had some exhibitors that have been coming every year for 50 years in our beef cattle competitions but they understand completely why it can't go ahead this year. ""Our focus now will be on creating ways to connect the city and country, through a digital means of course, so we will be working on that in the coming weeks."" Anyone who had already paid entry fees for early competitions would receive a refund.   The Royal Queensland Show has been running for almost 145 years. Mr Christou said the show's cancellation would have an impact on the RNA's bottom line. ""It's very unlikely these restrictions are going to lifted by August and then of course being the standby hospital we don't know when or if we need to be enacted so this was a sensible thing to do,"" he said. ""We rely on the Ekka and other events, and it's not just the Ekka that can't proceed, all our other events in the coming months have been cancelled so it's going to have a huge impact on us as well as every other organisation across the global."" He said RNA was working with the State and Federal governments on ways to get financial assistance.    ",By Rachel Riga and staff,"April 06, 2020"
40,/news/2020-04-05/australian-farmers-stockpile-cheap-diesel-amid-coronavirus/12120884,Australian farmers stockpile cheap diesel amid coronavirus 'demand destruction',"Tank manufacturers have seen a spike in demand for on-farm fuel storage as diesel prices drop and farmers become concerned about supply in the lead up to seeding.   Farmers are stocking up on fuel at some of the cheapest prices seen in a decade, which is expected to be a boon for profitability in dark economic times.   But experts say the low prices at the bowser are likely to continue in coming months, and concerns from industry about potential disruptions to supply are unwarranted.   Farmer Kallum Blake, who runs a mixed sheep and cropping business at Katanning, in WA's Great Southern, said cheap diesel prices were a welcome development. Normally we have some fuel on hand by about now but the way the price went we were scrounging around filling everything we can.  ""Coming into seeding, being able to buy fuel that's 40 cents per litre cheaper than the same time last year makes a big difference to an operation. ""It will be a really important factor when putting a crop in because fuel is one of the largest expenses.""      Chad Southcott works for a WA-based tank storage manufacturer. He said the company had seen a 70 per cent increase in demand year-on-year for diesel storage capacity during March because of panic buying. As the COVID-19 situation has really ramped up we've pretty much straight away seen a large increase across the board of people looking to get water, fertiliser and diesel tanks. ""We've really noticed the increase in demand for diesel storage… people are saying they haven't seen fuel prices this cheap, but they're also concerned they may not have enough to get them through so they're trying to store as much as possible. ""Farmers are concerned that if companies shut-down they may not be able to get their products."" Mark McKenzie from the Australasian Convenience and Petroleum Marketers Association said potential supply disruptions were unlikely.   ""We're awash with fuel in the network so every possible inground tank and inground terminal, fuel storage vessel and silo in ports is being filled as we're storing fuel that isn't actually going into the market,"" he said. ""Given we have so much oil around the place we're getting a discounting that hasn't occurred in past. ""[Russia and OPEC] usually manage the supply down and you don't get this big discount because they're trying to make sure they're maintaining good prices. But the demand destruction that is occurring as a result of COVID-19 across continents of North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific – the oil producers are getting pretty nervous. ""What they're doing is they just keep discounting so we're seeing oil prices go to some of the lowest they've been in almost 25 years.""   Mr McKenzie said low prices were likely to continue for the foreseeable future. ""We're starting to see the lowest prices for diesel we've seen in 10-12 years,"" he said. I think it's going to go a little bit lower as we go deeper into the COVID-19 crisis because we're going to see a greater downturn on the basis of excess supply. ""On a wholesale basis you're going to enjoy very low prices.""  ",ABC South West WA      By                                 Jessica Hayes,"April 05, 2020"
41,/news/2020-04-03/coronavirus-push-for-rural-remote-service-delivery-long-term/12109570,Coronavirus could see rural Australians end up better connected to essential services via online delivery,"If there is anything good to come out of the coronavirus pandemic, it could be that rural Australians end up better connected to essential and recreational services than ever before.    The Federal Government this week announced a $669 million expansion of Medicare subsidies for telehealth services, allowing general practitioners and allied health professionals to consult with patients over video conferencing rather than face to face. It is a development Brisbane speech pathologist Heidi Begg has been seeking for the past four years for rural communities. Ms Begg's practice, Spot Therapy, has been delivering speech therapy lessons all over regional Australia but — without Medicare subsidies — at full cost to its clients.     Now that all health professionals can access their patients online, Ms Begg said the delivery of services to rural and remote Australia would be changed forever. ""There are lots of great therapists and clinicians who are [only] comfortable seeing their clients face-to-face clients,"" she said. ""I don't just mean speech therapists, but paediatricians, psychologists — people that are really lacking in the bush."" Ms Begg said those therapists and clinicians were now discovering that it was possible to deliver care remotely, it just required a bit more effort when it came to engaging a child over a screen.  ""You just have to improvise a lot of the time, it's quite entertaining,"" she said.     Hippotherapy, from the Greek word 'hippos' meaning horse, literally means treatment with a horse — and, for clients of the Two Hearts Therapy equine school, it used to involve travel to the riding facility near Brisbane. But after just two weeks of coronavirus regulations, equine-assisted occupational therapy is now also being successfully delivered online. Occupational therapist, Cassie Allison, said she just had to get creative. ""We're adapting a few ways, by using the ponies as a bit of an 'elf on the shelf' for little kids or, if a child finishes an activity, we will go over and video chat with one of our horses, Biscuit and give him a treat,"" she said. ""I'm also sending some of our clients videos of what the ponies have been up to and that helps prompt a discussion.""     Ms Allison said she never would have thought remote hippotherapy possible, but she could now see the online service continuing and even expanding in the future. ""It's definitely something I would have never thought of doing before, but I think it has some longevity to it,"" she said. ""Why not now go regional?"" That was a sentiment shared by Adam Coltzau, a general practitioner in the south west Queensland town of St George and the past president of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia. In preparing his community for COVID-19, Dr Coltzau had been using phone and video technology to consult with many of his patients, reducing the need for face-to-face interaction.   He said the expansion of telehealth would result in a healthier rural population, long after the pandemic. ""People often avoid going to the doctor and put their farm and animals' health above their own,"" Dr Coltzau said. ""We hope that telehealth will really allow people to be more connected with their doctor and their allied health practitioner, so we can change health in the bush for the better.""   In north-west Queensland, Branches Performing Arts — like many similar organisations across Australia — had chosen to go online to continue to deliver dance classes to its students in Cloncurry, Julia Creek and Hughenden. In the past, some students had to travel hundreds of kilometres each week from remote cattle stations to learn to dance, and owner Amy Tinning said online classes had been on her radar for a long time before COVID-19 restrictions.   ""We straight away turned to digital platforms,"" she said. ""We've trialled [video conferencing] and then this week we're also distributing pre-recorded classes. ""Certainly, we've had to modify what we do greatly, but our digital platform has been really integral in not restricting our students any more than they already are."" Ms Tinning said she wanted to continue offering online dance classes to rural and remote students after the pandemic passes.  ""Digitising the way we offer dance training is something that has honestly been on the to-do list for quite a few years now, so I believe that, COVID-19 crisis or not, this is here to stay for us,"" she said. ""There's always been a fair bit of interest there, from kids in the bush or various towns who would like to access [dance] training.""

42,/news/2020-04-08/women-in-agriculture-show-girls-make-great-farmers/12130138,Father stunned by response after asking for help convincing his daughter that girls are farmers too,"A father of three girls on a farm in Western Australia's wheat belt has been inundated with uplifting messages about women in agriculture. Ty Fulwood was unpacking a travel bag with his oldest daughter, three-year-old Sylvie, when she made a surprising comment. She had playfully asked him if he would share his work clothes.   He took it as a sign she was thinking about a future working on the farm. ""Are you going to help Daddy when you get older and be a farmer?"" he asked. Her response stunned him. ""No daddy, I'm not going to be a farmer,"" she insisted. ""I'm a girl not a boy."" He realised that despite creating a supportive environment for his daughters, they didn't see many females working on the farm and that had created a perception in their young minds that women don't work in agriculture. ""For her at three-and-a-half to think that it wasn't an option because she was a girl just really stumped me,"" Mr Fulwood said. Mr Fulwood, who runs a cropping operation growing wheat and canola in Cunderdin, 150 kilometres east of Perth, wanted to show his daughters examples of female farmers. But because of coronavirus restrictions couldn't do it in person. So he took to Twitter. Hundreds of people have responded with videos and photos of life on the land.   ""I thought I might get a couple of responses but it was quite a large response,"" he said. Some people shared videos, directed to Sylvie, explaining why they had a passion for agriculture.   Others shared images of themselves or their daughters and wives getting busy on the farm, helping with lambing, feeding livestock or working with heavy machinery. Western Australian wool producer Emily Stretch shared a video of feeding time. ""I filled the feeder using the auger and reversed the trailer no worries,"" Ms Stretch said. ""Girls can do anything they put their mind to, so can guys!"" In northern Queensland, Kate Andison and her four sisters all consider themselves farmers. ""Our parents are farmers and we all work together at home on our family cattle property,"" Ms Andison said. ""They are very proud and happy that girls can be farmers and work in our family's business. You can do what ever you want to and remember that girls make the best farmers.""   UK farmer Eleanor Durdy said farming wasn't just a man's world. ""They have a female farmer emoji, so it must be true!"" said Ms Durdy, highlighting the importance of making women in agriculture more visible. Mr Fulwood said his next challenge was to keep his young daughter's attention while showing her the many videos and stories sent her way.   He added that he would keep the Twitter thread for future use when his daughters are a bit older. ""There were so many positive responses and from what I saw there were so many responses from men and women,"" Mr Fulwood said. ""I think it's an issue that affects all of us and we are all trying to manage.""   He said agriculture was slow to change partly because inter-generational farms don't change hands very often. ""I only came back to the farm at 30 after a life in the city and a few things hit home with me about gender roles and attitudes to change,"" he said. ""I find it very good to see men and women sharing and commenting and contributing to the conversation.""",Landline      By                                 Margot Kelly,"April 08, 2020"

But producers who sell directly to the public are seeing an unprecedented spike in demand as customers increasingly look for ways to avoid busy supermarket aisles amid tight social distancing restrictions. For beef producers Rod and Debbie Richardson, COVID-19 meant they lost sales to restaurants and could no longer run their on-farm tourism venture — but they are staying afloat thanks to a huge spike in retail customers. ""We've seen an 85 to 100 per cent increase in orders this month alone,"" Mrs Richardson said. ""Our beef is our lifeline at the moment.

""We figure we've got a truck and we're making the trip, so why not try to help people?""

Organisers of Corryong's Man From Snowy River Bush Festival, expected to attract at least 20,000 people to the state's north-east this week, was cancelled after a state of emergency declaration ruled out gatherings of more than 500 people.  It came as neighbouring border town Albury reluctantly conducted its annual Gold Cup racing carnival behind closed doors late last month. Corryong lost hundreds of thousands of hectares of land, properties and livestock to the fires and many residents were cut off for weeks.  It is estimated more than $200 million will be lost across the region for the March quarter.    Tourism North East industry and product development manager Sarah Pilgrim said communities and tourism operators were now devastated by the coronavirus strife.  ""It's like insult to injury,"" she said. Ms Pilgrim said it was an ""incredibly tough time"" for local tourism. ""It reflects a decrease in visitation numbers and, of course, is very concerning in the employment of full-time and casual staff that work in the industry,"" she said.   All of the profits from the four-day Man From Snowy River Festival were to be donated to the local community. ""After the heartache of this summer's bushfires, it is with deep regret we must postpone this year's festival,"" organisers announced on the festival website.   Towong Shire Mayor David Wortmann said the festival was ""the biggest event in the shire"" and, while the community's health was top priority, its absence would be deeply felt.  ""It's a great boost to all the businesses, not only to Corryong but the surrounding districts as well,"" he said. ""Everyone was looking forward to the festival.  ""With that many people coming to the Upper Murray, it was going to be such a boost to our communities and the economy."" Many events being called off had received bushfire grants and it's unclear how organisers would account for money spent. ""We'll be working with those events who have received those grant funding to see if we can arrange for the funding to be pushed to allow them to deliver these events when things are safe again,"" Ms Pilgrim said.    About 70 kilometres away in Albury, the annual Gold Cup carnival went ahead, but not as organisers were hoping following last year's washout. ""The great thing about last year and the strength of our carnival is that 5,000 people still attended and had a great time partying without racing,"" said Albury Racing Club chief executive Steve Hetherton.  The $200,000 feature race, won by 40-1 outsider Spunlago, was to take place before as many as 12,000 racegoers.  Knock-on effects have been felt in surrounding towns missing out on visitors staying and spending locally. Racing NSW is expected to decide today if the meeting goes ahead. Mr Hetherton insisted it should, even if spectators were limited to television and online.  ""As a community and as a club, we feel very strongly that racing should go ahead for our participants, our local owners, trainers, jockeys and everyone connected to the local racing scene,"" Mr Hetherton said.  But, he said, turning away racegoers was a major blow for Albury.  ",ABC Goulburn Murray      By                                 Mikaela Ortolan,"April 07, 2020"

Luckily, online sales and diversification into a new and exciting breed of cattle has helped this sister and brother family business get them through the thick of a difficult season.  Yield is down on this year's vintage, but good prices for their Canadian-bred speckle park cattle is keeping staff employed. ""All up I think that means that we're down about 80 per cent on sales for the year, which has been really hard,"" Ms Ellis said.   ""The cattle side of the business— which was usually more of a luxury item for us — has become a really important revenue stream of recent months which has been great.""  The speckle park breed has been in the country for over 10 years and is a combination of three breeds of British cattle — Angus, White Park and Teeswater Shorthorn.  Ms Ellis runs about 50 cattle and sell their genetics, embryos and semen — along with a few studs.  ""My parents handed the reins over to my brother and me in 2011. They decided to take a different path and get serious into cattle,"" Ms Ellis said.    ""At the time speckle park had been in Australia for a handful of years, but they liked the look of them, how tender they are and also how gentle."" She has been selling some of the cattle off to market or has them processed nearby in Kyneton to sell as packaged meat at their cellar door.  ""We've lost a lot of business with closures to our cellar door and a hit to agritourism, but now is not the time to be letting go of staff, let me tell you,"" she said.  ""They are working around the clock to make sure we're selling wine in 12 months' time, so this is our most expensive time of year, and the most labour intensive.    ""Our staff are like family to us. Most have been here for 10 to 15 years and we made a stand early on that it didn't matter how bad this got, we want to stay open as long as humanly possible to pay and keep the staff.""  Unlike many other vineyards across the state, the Ellis family were not affected by smoke taint, but poor weather conditions has meant they will produce much less wine this year.   For farmer Peter Leeke at Kimbarra Wines in the Grampians, early frost and unpredictable weather conditions has meant his vintage is almost non-existent.  ""It's one of those seasons where you can't predict things and it's out of our control,"" Mr Leeke said.  ""This year our vineyard will probably produce under a tonne of grapes  — last year was 40 tonnes.""  Despite the hit to his vineyard, his wool sales to China last November are enough to get him through. ""We run about 2,500 head of super-fine merino. We sold wool last year, and the sales were very good,"" he said. ""The wool market is taking a hit at the moment, but hopefully it will bounce back. We shear in July and August, so we're hoping it will be back to normal by then — it's a wait and see game."" He said diversification has allowed him to get through difficult seasons.

52,/news/2020-04-03/coronavirus-push-for-rural-remote-service-delivery-long-term/12109570,Coronavirus could see rural Australians end up better connected to essential services via online delivery,"If there is anything good to come out of the coronavirus pandemic, it could be that rural Australians end up better connected to essential and recreational services than ever before.    The Federal Government this week announced a $669 million expansion of Medicare subsidies for telehealth services, allowing general practitioners and allied health professionals to consult with patients over video conferencing rather than face to face. It is a development Brisbane speech pathologist Heidi Begg has been seeking for the past four years for rural communities. Ms Begg's practice, Spot Therapy, has been delivering speech therapy lessons all over regional Australia but — without Medicare subsidies — at full cost to its clients.     Now that all health professionals can access their patients online, Ms Begg said the delivery of services to rural and remote Australia would be changed forever. ""There are lots of great therapists and clinicians who are [only] comfortable seeing their clients face-to-face clients,"" she said. ""I don't just mean speech therapists, but paediatricians, psychologists — people that are really lacking in the bush."" Ms Begg said those therapists and clinicians were now discovering that it was possible to deliver care remotely, it just required a bit more effort when it came to engaging a child over a screen.  ""You just have to improvise a lot of the time, it's quite entertaining,"" she said.     Hippotherapy, from the Greek word 'hippos' meaning horse, literally means treatment with a horse — and, for clients of the Two Hearts Therapy equine school, it used to involve travel to the riding facility near Brisbane. But after just two weeks of coronavirus regulations, equine-assisted occupational therapy is now also being successfully delivered online. Occupational therapist, Cassie Allison, said she just had to get creative. ""We're adapting a few ways, by using the ponies as a bit of an 'elf on the shelf' for little kids or, if a child finishes an activity, we will go over and video chat with one of our horses, Biscuit and give him a treat,"" she said. ""I'm also sending some of our clients videos of what the ponies have been up to and that helps prompt a discussion.""     Ms Allison said she never would have thought remote hippotherapy possible, but she could now see the online service continuing and even expanding in the future. ""It's definitely something I would have never thought of doing before, but I think it has some longevity to it,"" she said. ""Why not now go regional?"" That was a sentiment shared by Adam Coltzau, a general practitioner in the south west Queensland town of St George and the past president of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia. In preparing his community for COVID-19, Dr Coltzau had been using phone and video technology to consult with many of his patients, reducing the need for face-to-face interaction.   He said the expansion of telehealth would result in a healthier rural population, long after the pandemic. ""People often avoid going to the doctor and put their farm and animals' health above their own,"" Dr Coltzau said. ""We hope that telehealth will really allow people to be more connected with their doctor and their allied health practitioner, so we can change health in the bush for the better.""   In north-west Queensland, Branches Performing Arts — like many similar organisations across Australia — had chosen to go online to continue to deliver dance classes to its students in Cloncurry, Julia Creek and Hughenden. In the past, some students had to travel hundreds of kilometres each week from remote cattle stations to learn to dance, and owner Amy Tinning said online classes had been on her radar for a long time before COVID-19 restrictions.   ""We straight away turned to digital platforms,"" she said. ""We've trialled [video conferencing] and then this week we're also distributing pre-recorded classes. ""Certainly, we've had to modify what we do greatly, but our digital platform has been really integral in not restricting our students any more than they already are."" Ms Tinning said she wanted to continue offering online dance classes to rural and remote students after the pandemic passes.  ""Digitising the way we offer dance training is something that has honestly been on the to-do list for quite a few years now, so I believe that, COVID-19 crisis or not, this is here to stay for us,"" she said.
