The lockdown, implemented on March 22, has resulted in a ""significant improvement in air quality in the country"", as revealed by data analysis from India's Central Pollution Control Board. The report showed air quality in 85 cities had improved significantly as most vehicles remained off roads and non-essential businesses closed.  The report said: ""Data shows that on average, Indian cities had an AQI [Air Quality Index] of 115 between March 16 and 24."" ""The air quality started showing improvements from the first day of the 21-day lockdown. The average AQI fell to 75 in the first three days of the lockdown.""   Dozens of residents from the Jalandhar district in Punjab took to social media to share crystal-clear views of the snow-capped mountains, thanking the improved air quality for the awe-inspiring snaps. The mountain range is the world's highest with elevations of more than 8,000 metres, and includes the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest.   Some residents claimed it was the first time they had seen the peaks.   According to the latest figures from India's health ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has passed the 4,000 mark with more than 100 people dead so far. India has a population of around 1.3 billion people, with one of the world's most polluted cities, according to IQ Air pollution researchers. Ghaziabad, an area close to New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, had been ranked as the world's most polluted, with an average PM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019.  The microscopic particles, known as PM 2.5, are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, and are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system of a human.   Air pollution over China also plummeted in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to NASA. NASA and the European Space Agency's pollution monitoring satellites detected a significant decline in the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China since the lockdown. ""There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus,"" NASA said in a statement. According to NASA, the reduction in NO2 was first apparent near Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, where millions of people were quarantined. Environmental researchers also noticed air pollution levels plummeted in the Asia Pacific with carbon emissions also expected to drop, according to the Australian National University.

""Existing clients basically straight away [saying] 'put our jobs on hold',"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Mr Fowkes said about two dozen customers had shelved plans to install rooftop solar in the wake of the sudden axing of the Northern Territory's one-to-one feed-in tariff. The generous rate at which solar system-owners were paid for excess energy sent back to the grid helped drive rooftop solar uptake in the NT from the lowest levels in the country to levels that experts warned the Top End grid had not been upgraded to manage. A 67 per cent cut to the tariff for new systems — from 24 cents for every kilowatt hour down to eight — was rolled in with the Government's announcement this week of $30 million for a large-scale battery to support the Darwin to Katherine system. Renewables Minister Dale Wakefield said the battery and $800,000 in subsidies for more rooftop solar storage were ""two huge steps forward in our plan for 50 per cent renewables by 2030."" But she refused to say why the tariff change was made without notice, when the Government had promised consultations and a draft policy to be released last year. Mr Fowkes said solar installers were not prepared for a snap announcement but knew a policy change was coming. ""We all knew how unstable the grid was and how hard it was for Power and Water to maintain the voltage et cetera,"" he said. ""But a bit of notice, and maybe even some better timing, would have been helpful."" Ms Wakefield said Labor was continuing with ""the business of government"" while dealing with the coronavirus fallout, including its renewables and energy policies.   She acknowledged recent criticism by the Utilities Commission, which commented on ""significant changes"" in the Darwin to Katherine grid, where rooftop solar had ""exceeded expectations"" and 60 megawatts of large-scale solar was due for connection in coming months. The commission said it had to approve tough new technical requirements on large-scale solar generators to head off ""serious reliability and security issues"" on the system, partly because of a lack of government progress on its promised reforms. ""That's why it's been important for us to continue this work even throughout the COVID crisis,"" Ms Wakefield said. ""We want to make sure we've got a stable and strong power system that delivers what Territorians need."" The NT Government said its large-scale battery would save government-owned Territory Generation $6.4 million and 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. The author of the Government's Roadmap to Renewables report, Alan Langworthy, said Labor deserved credit for moving in the right direction, but he said there was much more reform work to be done. And he said there remained a ""very significant risk"" of a system crash on the Darwin to Katherine grid. ""It will be two years before the [large-scale] battery is up and going, and I'm not sure the current mechanisms for household use are going to change people's demand or generation model at all,"" he said. ""That still leaves the grid in quite a lot of vulnerability."" A Government spokesperson said the $800,000 set aside for battery subsidies would cover up to 130 grants. But about 12,000 households and businesses installed rooftop solar before the tariff change, according to retailer Jacana Energy. Under grandfathering arrangements, those customers will continue to receive the one-for-one rebate, surrendering it only if they move, upgrade their system capacity, or take up the battery subsidy. The Government said its tariff change was a recommendation from the roadmap report, but Mr Langworthy said the actual guidance was for the creation of a time-of-day feed-in tariff to encourage greater battery uptake. Using a time-of-day tariff, customers get paid more for their power if it is exported to the grid during a peak-demand period like the early evening. ""With net metering left in place there's no incentive for people to install a battery, so basically it's status quo,"" Mr Langworthy said. ""If the Government had in fact instituted a time-of-day tariff they could have gotten a good solid take-up of battery support delivering energy into the system when they really need it, which is in the 5:00 to 9:00 at night period."" Ms Wakefield said the Government was considering the time-of-day tariff proposal and would monitor the uptake of batteries going forward. She also said the Government would speak with small solar installers like Ms Fowkes, who were imploring the Government to allow a tariff-change grace period. ""We know that solar is still a great investment for people when people sit down and do the figures,"" she said.

It comes after the New South Wales Threatened Species Scientific Committee said there was not enough evidence to suggest the removal of dingoes would cause a flow-on effect on small mammals or reptiles. The committee has made a preliminary decision to reject a proposal to list the cascading effects of the loss or removal of dingoes from New South Wales landscape as a key threatening process. Committee chair Anne Kerle said it was a divisive issue.   ""It is a very complex issue and research has been carried out to suggest that the removal of a top predator, which is the dingo, means that kangaroo numbers have exploded, damaging the ecology where they live."" Ecologists supporting that claim said the kangaroos went on to damage the ecology of the landscape, prompting a cascade effect on small mammals or reptiles. Dr Kerle said the evidence did not support that claim. ""I think if you look at the determination it says that, while there appears to be conclusive evidence in parts of the state, it doesn't appear to be as conclusive in other parts of the state,"" she said. ""There is also the interaction between dingoes and foxes and feral cats and what that interaction actually means. ""We didn't feel it [the evidence] was solid enough across the state to pursue [the listing] at this stage.""  Dingo management in New South Wales has long been driven by farmers using physical barriers and lethal control. Mitchell Clapham is head of NSW Farmers' Conservation and Resource Management Committee and farms near Mudgee in the state's Central West.   Mr Clapham said it was important farmers kept getting rid of problematic dogs. ""I would think that for once we are in furious agreement with the recommendations that come via the scientific committee here,"" Mr Clapham said. ""We need to be able to continually control the dogs and protect our livestock. ""It is a real issue especially when a dog gets a bit of age, a bit of experience, they can do enormous economic damage to producers and it is nothing to lose 100 or 200 sheep in a year."" Scientists say dingo hotspots in New South Wales include the Washpool National Park, north of Port Macquarie, and the Myall lakes, which is home to the Mungo Brush pack. It is the subject of a current research project aimed at developing non-lethal tools for dingo management.   The work involves fitting dingoes with custom-built satellite GPS collars that record their locations every two hours. The data will allow the scientists to build up an accurate picture of where the dingoes are spending their time, and properly assess potential tools to manage dingo movements. Neil Jordan is a conservation biologist from the University of New South Wales who is head of the project. ""It is basically a field-based project to understand the movements and ecology of dingoes in the Myall Lakes region and to test some potential non-lethal deterrents to stop them predating on livestock,"" he said. Dr Jordan is also a member of the Taronga Conservation Society of Australia and researchers there are developing a scent-based management tool for dingoes and other wild dogs in Australia. The research is based on the premise that dingoes communicate territorial ownership using scent-marks and vocalisations. Dr Jordan said, contrary to what the scientific committee found, he believed that evidence showed the loss of dingoes caused a cascading effect on smaller species in the wild. ""They have a crucial set of ecosystem services that are really important to biodiversity and they contribute to keeping feral animal species down, so foxes and cats,"" he said. He said it was timely to look at dingo management. ""As I said dingoes can have a negative impact on the livestock industry, so it is only right that we should look at potentially managing and reducing those impacts while retaining dingoes in the wild landscape,"" Dr Jordan said. The Australian Ecological Society does not hold back in its defence of dingoes and is fiercely against extreme culling. ""Dingo management parallels persecution of the Tasmanian tiger: a top predator that was hunted for its alleged impact on livestock,"" the society said. ""Dingoes are persecuted for similar reasons to the extinct Tasmanian tiger.""   The society said that persecution had reduced the species' distribution and disrupted its social structure, potentially accelerating the demise of the species through hybridisation with feral domestic dogs.  The society was in favour of non-lethal control measures. ""Alternatives to lethal control and the dingo fence exist, with potential benefits to farmers and biodiversity alike,"" it said. Victoria also rejected listing the loss of the dingo as a key threatening process to the landscape in that state. Back in New South Wales, the head of the scientific committee there, Anne Kerle said she and her colleagues had to weigh up all the evidence before making what she said was an agonising decision. ""Despite there being good evidence that the loss of dingoes could adversely affect some threatened species or ecological communities, there remains a considerable difference of scientific opinion about the complexity of interactions involved,"" she said.

6,/news/2020-04-08/future-tense-nuclear-fusion-sustainable-power-promise/12114948,"Nuclear fusion promises a clean, green energy future — but there's a catch","It's a nuclear race like no other, involving billions of dollars and hundreds of scientists from across the globe. Their aim is as ambitious as it is monumental: to replicate the energy source that powers the solar system, effectively building a mini sun — a swirling mass of super-heated atomic plasma so hot that it can only be contained by a magnetic field. The process is called nuclear fusion. Scientists believe that if fusion technology can be successfully harnessed as a human energy source, it could help save the world from future environmental catastrophe. Just outside the port city of Marseille in the south of France work is underway on a giant nuclear fusion test facility known as ITER — Latin for ""the way"". Its construction is being funded by an international collaboration between 35 nations, and it's expected to cost somewhere between $27 billion and $36 billion when completed.   Australia isn't a member of the consortium, but it does have a research relationship with the project involving both the ANU and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). ""It's called the largest scientific engineering project in the world,"" says ANSTO's Richard Garrett. ""The site is many hectares. The tokomak itself — the doughnut-shaped chamber the plasma will be confined in — is just enormous, 100,000 kilometres of superconducting cable, because it uses superconducting magnets to confine this plasma as tightly as possible. ""It's about three or four Eiffel Towers' worth of steel. ""In fact, I think the world's production of superconducting wire had to be increased about 10 times to supply ITER.""   Conventional nuclear reactors harness energy from a process called fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of a large atom. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, works by forcing atoms together in order to release energy. British physicist David Kingham says fusion technology has significant benefits over its established counterpart.   ""The advantages of fusion are: no risk of meltdown — it's very easy to stop it safely — no production of radioactive waste, and a very high energy density of the fuel,"" he says. ""In some ways fusion has all the advantages of nuclear fission without any of the drawbacks like risk of meltdown or long-lived radioactive waste."" But generating energy from nuclear fusion has proved far more difficult than scientists initially thought back in the 1960s when it was first mooted as a serious future energy source. Early test reactors managed to produce a fusion reaction, but not one that was sustainable or energy efficient. In other words, it took more energy to produce the reaction, than the reaction itself produced.   ITER was originally launched way back in 1985, amid great expectation. Its collaborative structure was designed to ensure the whole world would eventually benefit from the technology, not just one or two nations. But the initial stages of the project were problematic. On-site construction didn't begin until 2010. And even then, it was slow to get going. ""I think fundamentally that tells us that these international collaborations are quite difficult to achieve,"" Professor Garrett says. ""Five or six years ago, ITER was not in a good shape. It was late, it was over-budget. But a new directorate was put in on the project and they have really got the thing moving in the right direction.""   The first plasma experiments are now expected to begin in 2025. For ITER to be considered a success, according to Professor Garrett, it must demonstrate that it can achieve an energy gain of a factor of 10. ""ITER consumes 50 megawatts of power to produce this plasma at 150 million degrees, and the goal is to produce 500 megawatts of power from that plasma,"" he says. ""The second goal is to be able to maintain that condition for many minutes at a time, so maybe 10 minutes, up to an hour, and that's what you would need for a steady-state power reactor."" ITER isn't the only nuclear fusion initiative underway. In both North America and the United Kingdom there are numerous projects operating on a smaller scale. One of them involves the company Tokamak Energy, whose executive vice chairman is Dr Kingham. ""I think private investors can see solid scientific foundations for the business,"" he says. Tokamak Energy is yet to produce a fusion reaction at its test facility in Oxfordshire.   But that's not the immediate priority, Dr Kingham says. The company's researchers are using a spherically shaped tokamak chamber that they hope will deliver greater efficiencies than the donut-shaped one designed for ITER. The aim is to increase the plasma temperature during the fusion process.   ""The next big milestone for us is to achieve a 100 million degree (Celsius) plasma temperature,"" Dr Kingham says. After that, they'll then need to demonstrate that the enhanced superconducting magnets within the tokamak have the strength required to effectively contain the plasma. Dr Kingham expects both of those milestones to be met by the end of next year. He says the company will then need to raise the additional investment necessary to fast-track the development of a small fusion demonstrator device by 2025, the same year that ITER expects to begin its initial plasma testing. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is also seeking to outrun ITER in designing its own fusion reactor. Known as STEP, the UKAEA research collaboration has recently received a $430 million investment from the British Government.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson even made it part of his re-election pitch during December's election. Like Dr Kingham, STEP's boss Howard Wilson is cautiously critical of the approach taken by ITER. ""It looks like if you go down that route alone you'll end up with a very expensive solution which won't be commercially deployable, and that's why we are keen on innovations which will reduce the cost,"" he says. He also agrees with Dr Kingham that a focus on developing high-temperature superconducting magnets is a priority. ""If you can double the field strength of your device, reduce the size substantially, it becomes a lot cheaper but it can produce the same amount of power,"" he says. ""That really makes the difference to commercial deployability of the technology. We've got to be cost-competitive with oil, gas, coal and renewables."" Proponents of nuclear fusion believe it will end the world's dependence on fossil fuels once and forever. But the catch is that no-one involved in the research believes a fully operational, commercially viable nuclear fusion reactor will be operating before at least 2050. That fact has seen some question the level of financial investment, including Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, the director of Energy Research at Oxford University and a former director general of CERN. He once managed the UK's fusion program, but two years ago, in an interview with the Simons Centre for Geometry and Physics, he expressed doubts about ITER and the viability of the industry in general. ""I used to think that there was a reasonably good chance that fusion could compete with other low carbon sources of power, but while I would not say that it's impossible, the situation has changed,"" he said.  ""The cost of wind and solar power has decreased faster than anyone could have dreamed. Meanwhile ITER has gone way over budget. Fusion reactors will be intrinsically more expensive than we thought a decade ago.""   He argues that ITER needs to go ahead, but that a final cost comparison with renewables should be conducted before any construction on a full-scale reactor is begun. Dr Kingham understands the argument, but he believes the long-term economics still make sense. ""The point with renewables is that large-scale transmission of power across the world is not necessarily going to be feasible, and extremely large-scale storage looks prohibitively expensive and perhaps even technically not feasible,"" he says.

7,/news/2020-04-08/future-tense-nuclear-fusion-sustainable-power-promise/12114948,"Nuclear fusion promises a clean, green energy future — but there's a catch","It's a nuclear race like no other, involving billions of dollars and hundreds of scientists from across the globe. Their aim is as ambitious as it is monumental: to replicate the energy source that powers the solar system, effectively building a mini sun — a swirling mass of super-heated atomic plasma so hot that it can only be contained by a magnetic field. The process is called nuclear fusion. Scientists believe that if fusion technology can be successfully harnessed as a human energy source, it could help save the world from future environmental catastrophe. Just outside the port city of Marseille in the south of France work is underway on a giant nuclear fusion test facility known as ITER — Latin for ""the way"". Its construction is being funded by an international collaboration between 35 nations, and it's expected to cost somewhere between $27 billion and $36 billion when completed.   Australia isn't a member of the consortium, but it does have a research relationship with the project involving both the ANU and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). ""It's called the largest scientific engineering project in the world,"" says ANSTO's Richard Garrett. ""The site is many hectares. The tokomak itself — the doughnut-shaped chamber the plasma will be confined in — is just enormous, 100,000 kilometres of superconducting cable, because it uses superconducting magnets to confine this plasma as tightly as possible. ""It's about three or four Eiffel Towers' worth of steel. ""In fact, I think the world's production of superconducting wire had to be increased about 10 times to supply ITER.""   Conventional nuclear reactors harness energy from a process called fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of a large atom. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, works by forcing atoms together in order to release energy. British physicist David Kingham says fusion technology has significant benefits over its established counterpart.   ""The advantages of fusion are: no risk of meltdown — it's very easy to stop it safely — no production of radioactive waste, and a very high energy density of the fuel,"" he says. ""In some ways fusion has all the advantages of nuclear fission without any of the drawbacks like risk of meltdown or long-lived radioactive waste."" But generating energy from nuclear fusion has proved far more difficult than scientists initially thought back in the 1960s when it was first mooted as a serious future energy source. Early test reactors managed to produce a fusion reaction, but not one that was sustainable or energy efficient. In other words, it took more energy to produce the reaction, than the reaction itself produced.   ITER was originally launched way back in 1985, amid great expectation. Its collaborative structure was designed to ensure the whole world would eventually benefit from the technology, not just one or two nations. But the initial stages of the project were problematic. On-site construction didn't begin until 2010. And even then, it was slow to get going. ""I think fundamentally that tells us that these international collaborations are quite difficult to achieve,"" Professor Garrett says. ""Five or six years ago, ITER was not in a good shape. It was late, it was over-budget. But a new directorate was put in on the project and they have really got the thing moving in the right direction.""   The first plasma experiments are now expected to begin in 2025. For ITER to be considered a success, according to Professor Garrett, it must demonstrate that it can achieve an energy gain of a factor of 10. ""ITER consumes 50 megawatts of power to produce this plasma at 150 million degrees, and the goal is to produce 500 megawatts of power from that plasma,"" he says. ""The second goal is to be able to maintain that condition for many minutes at a time, so maybe 10 minutes, up to an hour, and that's what you would need for a steady-state power reactor."" ITER isn't the only nuclear fusion initiative underway. In both North America and the United Kingdom there are numerous projects operating on a smaller scale. One of them involves the company Tokamak Energy, whose executive vice chairman is Dr Kingham. ""I think private investors can see solid scientific foundations for the business,"" he says. Tokamak Energy is yet to produce a fusion reaction at its test facility in Oxfordshire.   But that's not the immediate priority, Dr Kingham says. The company's researchers are using a spherically shaped tokamak chamber that they hope will deliver greater efficiencies than the donut-shaped one designed for ITER. The aim is to increase the plasma temperature during the fusion process.   ""The next big milestone for us is to achieve a 100 million degree (Celsius) plasma temperature,"" Dr Kingham says. After that, they'll then need to demonstrate that the enhanced superconducting magnets within the tokamak have the strength required to effectively contain the plasma. Dr Kingham expects both of those milestones to be met by the end of next year. He says the company will then need to raise the additional investment necessary to fast-track the development of a small fusion demonstrator device by 2025, the same year that ITER expects to begin its initial plasma testing. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is also seeking to outrun ITER in designing its own fusion reactor. Known as STEP, the UKAEA research collaboration has recently received a $430 million investment from the British Government.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson even made it part of his re-election pitch during December's election. Like Dr Kingham, STEP's boss Howard Wilson is cautiously critical of the approach taken by ITER. ""It looks like if you go down that route alone you'll end up with a very expensive solution which won't be commercially deployable, and that's why we are keen on innovations which will reduce the cost,"" he says. He also agrees with Dr Kingham that a focus on developing high-temperature superconducting magnets is a priority. ""If you can double the field strength of your device, reduce the size substantially, it becomes a lot cheaper but it can produce the same amount of power,"" he says. ""That really makes the difference to commercial deployability of the technology. We've got to be cost-competitive with oil, gas, coal and renewables."" Proponents of nuclear fusion believe it will end the world's dependence on fossil fuels once and forever. But the catch is that no-one involved in the research believes a fully operational, commercially viable nuclear fusion reactor will be operating before at least 2050. That fact has seen some question the level of financial investment, including Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, the director of Energy Research at Oxford University and a former director general of CERN. He once managed the UK's fusion program, but two years ago, in an interview with the Simons Centre for Geometry and Physics, he expressed doubts about ITER and the viability of the industry in general. ""I used to think that there was a reasonably good chance that fusion could compete with other low carbon sources of power, but while I would not say that it's impossible, the situation has changed,"" he said.  ""The cost of wind and solar power has decreased faster than anyone could have dreamed. Meanwhile ITER has gone way over budget. Fusion reactors will be intrinsically more expensive than we thought a decade ago.""   He argues that ITER needs to go ahead, but that a final cost comparison with renewables should be conducted before any construction on a full-scale reactor is begun. Dr Kingham understands the argument, but he believes the long-term economics still make sense. ""The point with renewables is that large-scale transmission of power across the world is not necessarily going to be feasible, and extremely large-scale storage looks prohibitively expensive and perhaps even technically not feasible,"" he says. ""So, I think fusion in the long-term sits alongside renewables as part of the low carbon solution we need to be developing and deploying.""   Professor Wilson adds that all projections indicate global energy needs are likely to dramatically increase as more and more people are lifted out of poverty in the developing world.

10,/news/2020-04-07/great-barrier-reef-most-widespread-coral-bleaching-on-record/12107054,Great Barrier Reef found to be coral bleached from north to south for first time,"The Great Barrier Reef is currently experiencing the most widespread bleaching ever recorded, with 60 per cent of reefs across all three regions affected, according to a detailed survey of the system.   It is the third mass bleaching event on the reef in five years — a phenomenon primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and one that had never been recorded before 1997. ""We were hoping that this year would be a relatively mild bleaching event, but unfortunately that's not the case,"" said Professor Terry Hughes, head of the ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies. ""We were really shocked. No scientist expected to see three severe bleaching events in just five years."" Professor Hughes spent nine days in an aeroplane surveying the damage to the reef.   In that time, he covered more than 10,000 kilometres to visually inspect more than 1,000 reefs, retracing surveys he did after previous bleaching events. Coral bleaches when the water is too warm for too long. The coral becomes stressed and expels the algae that live inside it. That algae gives coral its colour, and also provides it with most of the energy it needs to survive. If temperatures do not recover quickly, the coral starves and dies. It is too early to know yet how much coral will die as a result of this bleaching, but Professor Hughes said he feared the worst, particularly in the southern part of the reef. ""The southern bleaching was very severe and we were most concerned about the south because of the naivete of the corals that are there,"" he said.   ""They hadn't bleached before, which means there are more corals and more of the corals that are particularly susceptible to heat stress,"" he said. In the last two bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, about half the coral on the Great Barrier Reef was estimated to have died.   In those events, the areas hit hardest were in the remote northern stretches of the reef, around Lizard Island and beyond. The southern and central reef had mostly been spared. This time those parts were not so lucky.   ""For the first time, the [Great] Barrier Reef has bleached in all three major regions: in the north, in the central region and in the southern regions,"" Professor Hughes said. He said this time we might see coral die in the southern stretches in a similar way to what happened in the northern region a few years ago. Professor Hughes said one reason the north did not bleach so badly was because global warming was rapidly transforming its makeup. ""Quite frankly, [I'm] astonished by the speed of these changes,"" he said.   ""What we're seeing on the Great Barrier Reef now is a huge transformation in the mix of species. ""We're seeing less and less of the heat-sensitive, susceptible species — the so-called losers — compared to the tougher corals, which are persisting. ""The Great Barrier Reef is transitioning to a new mix of species that are tougher. ""Optimistically, we think it will take more heat in the future to cause the same level of bleaching and the same level of mortality as it does today."" But he said the species of coral that did not recover well after that previous bleaching — known as branching coral — provided important habitat for many fish species. ""Branching corals make all of the nooks and crannies that the rest of the biodiversity — the fish and so on — depend on,"" he said. ""So having fewer and fewer corals is having a much broader effect, not just on the corals themselves, but in the broader ecosystem.""   The big problem for any coral, he said, was repeated bleaching events in quick succession. ""As these bleachings occur more and more frequently, the damage from them accumulates,"" he said. ""There's less and less opportunity for a proper recovery between them — there isn't enough time,"" he said. Dr Selina Ward leads the University of Queensland's research station on Heron Island in the southern section of the reef, offshore from Gladstone. The reefs directly around Heron Island were spared in 2016 and 2017 and she is hopeful they will recover from the limited bleaching that did occur this year. ""The station manager told me it was great that they had 11 straight days of rainy, cloudy, windy weather,"" she said. ""That might just mean that it won't be as severe or last as long. It's hard to tell until you see the recovery — when the colour starts to come back."" Twenty kilometres east sits One Tree Island — the tiny coral cay lies within a scientific zone of the World Heritage Site.   It is shaped like a boomerang, surrounded by a lagoon, and is home to a research station for the University of Sydney. The island's only inhabitants are the station managers, Ruby Holmes and her partner. ""We have this emotional connection to this place because we live here, and we see the ocean; it's like our playground,"" Ms Holmes said. ""We know lots of the colonies and corals and spots really well. So when it started to change like that, I definitely felt emotional."" Coral within the surrounding lagoon started bleaching in early February when Ms Holmes said water temperatures were around 30 degrees Celsius. Since then, she estimates around 80 per cent of coral in the lagoon has been bleached.   She too hopes cooler, overcast, weather in March will help the coral recover, rather than die, but she fears this mass bleaching event is a sign of things to come. ""With global climate change, unfortunately, this is the kind of stuff that we're seeing in areas that were kind of 'safe havens',"" she said. ""Because we're further down south and we have a lot of tidal movement and water rushing in and out of the lagoon system and around them … it helped keep the coral cooler and the water moving [in 2016 and 2017]. ""But it's just been really, really, hot over summer. Unfortunately, this is what happens."" The coronavirus pandemic is also creating some problems for research on both Heron Island and One Tree Island, because scientists can no longer travel to the island to carry out their research.   On One Tree Island, Ms Holmes has had to try to fill some of those gaps. ""It puts us in that unique position where we can provide updates of what's happening out here for all the researchers and for the director of the station,"" Ms Holmes said. One observational experiment set up in the nearby waters, by a scientist from the University of Wollongong, is to study if certain coral colonies are more resistant to bleaching than others.  This event could provide crucial insights, and the pair will monitor the coral, take photographs and collect data from sites within the lagoon. ""It's nice to be able to keep that research going for them or at least provide them with some insight into what's happening,"" Ms Holmes said.

Two blazes erupted on Saturday inside the zone that was sealed off after the 1986 explosion at the plant. Firefighters said the smaller blaze had been put out but the second one was still burning over about 20 hectares. They said they were using aircraft to extinguish the blaze. Authorities said radiation levels in the area substantially exceeded normal levels. Radiation levels in the capital Kiev, about 100 kilometres south, were within the normal range.   The 2,600-square-kilometre Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was established after the April 1986 disaster at the plant sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe. The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave.  Blazes in the area have been a regular occurrence: some start when residents set dry grass on fire in the early spring, a widespread practice in Ukraine, Russia and some other ex-Soviet nations, that often leads to devastating forest fires. Police said they tracked down a person suspected of starting the blaze. They said the 27-year-old man said he burned grass ""for fun"", and then failed to extinguish the fire when the wind caused it to expand quickly.   Chernobyl polluted a large area of Europe when its fourth reactor exploded in April 1986, with the region immediately around the power plant the worst affected.

14,/news/2020-04-07/antarctica-climate-change-law-dome-hunt-for-hydroxyl-radicals/12110980,The hunt for hydroxyl radicals in Antarctica could reveal the secrets of our future climate ,"In every sense, gazing into an Antarctic time tunnel is a chilling experience. You lean over an icy entrance about the size of a dinner plate being exceptionally careful not to drop anything in.  It's hard to tell how far you are seeing. Five or 50 metres? A year, a decade, a century or more? As your eyes adjust they see beyond the snap-frozen present and deeper into the decades gone by.  The colour shifts from blinding white to electric blue and eventually to a darkness so unfathomable it could be a tunnel into deep space.  A core barrel is lowered into the cylindrical shaft, hanging on a cable. It travels at first through layers of hard-packed snow that still retain a connection to the atmosphere above.   Go deeper and those pore spaces close off under the weight of snow pushing down from above. The sheer compressive force compacts fluffy snowflakes into solid ice, trapping a tiny bubble of atmosphere from that moment.  Each bubble becomes a time capsule. The drill drops through the centuries, reaching for our pre-industrial past. To solve one of the enduring climate change riddles, we're going to need a lot of air from an awful lot of these bubbles.   In the summer of 2018-19, a team of Australian and US scientists headed ""deep field"" from the Australian Antarctic Division's Casey Station. They had set themselves a difficult challenge: haul hundreds of tonnes of delicate equipment, drilling rigs and enough supplies to the far side of distant Law Dome for three months to camp out in the ""home of the blizzard"". Their aim was to drill for a handful of atoms that could reveal how well the chemistry of the atmosphere had been removing problem greenhouse gases like methane. ""We know we're headed towards more [global] warming, but we don't know how exactly the atmosphere is going to behave as we continue to add more greenhouse gases to it,"" explains glaciologist Peter Neff.   Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by plants and absorption into the ocean, but it's a slow process.  Other warming gases like methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are more chemically active. They are partly removed from the atmosphere by a highly reactive, naturally occurring molecule called hydroxyl (OH).   ""The hydroxyl radical is sometimes called the detergent of the atmosphere,"" says atmospheric chemist Vasilii Petrenko.  Direct atmospheric measurements of hydroxyl only date from the mid-1980s. What climate modellers need is information back to the beginning of the industrial period so we can work out what OH was up to before we started adding to its workload with ever-increasing emissions. ""We know that it's probably been keeping up over the last couple of decades, but before that there's no information,"" adds co-investigator David Etheridge from the CSIRO. There would be profound implications if this extremely helpful molecule is found to have been losing its capacity to scrub the skies over time. Corrections would be needed for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it will continue to build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter, much faster than currently predicted.    About six years ago, Petrenko and his colleagues realised they might have found a way to uncover hydroxyl's secret history. A technique they pioneered in Greenland to analyse tell-tale carbon 14 (14C) atoms in ice cores had allowed the underlying sources of our rising methane emissions to be pinpointed.  If they could now mine enough ice as quickly as possible, they reasoned, and from just the right spot in Antarctica, enough trapped 14C atoms could be recovered to reconstruct the OH chemistry of the past.  Just the right spot meant Law Dome.    Law Dome is not the sort of place most sensible people would choose to pitch a tent. Even penguins don't visit.  The weather can be truly awful — think -25C on a summer's day. That's before you add in wind chill from storm-force gales that sweep the summit and blizzards dumping more snow here than nearly anywhere else in Antarctica.  ""A lot of snowfall comes off the coast, hits this very, very slight incline and dumps a lot of snow,"" Etheridge, an atmospheric scientist, shouts over a blizzard, ""about 4 metres per year, which is enormous by Antarctic standards. ""It's what we want, it's just not very comfortable.""  Life expectancy for an exposed human caught out in bad weather here is counted in minutes, not days.  Of course, it's not the endless views of a white nothingness that attracted Etheridge and the team of polar veterans to such a challenging place. The lure is lying directly under the thin nylon floor of our tents.    ""Law Dome is a stack of ancient snow that has been compressed into ice,"" Neff explains. ""The snow that accumulates here never melts so it's just this layer cake of years, with the most recent year's snowfall on top of the dome and then successively older layers at depth.""  We sleep on nearly a kilometre and a half of layered ice holding an impeccable atmospheric record stretching back at least 80,000 years.  Bounded by a pair of glaciers that drain ice from the enormous East Antarctic ice sheet, the 1,400-metre-high dome sits apart from the complicated ice flows of the continent like an island in a stream. Cores drilled here by Etheridge in the 1980s revealed, with unparalleled clarity, the rapid increase in greenhouse gases expelled over the industrial period. Now the team hopes to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through this same interval.  The team begins a military-style operation to extract ice cores in all weather conditions, with constant speed and absolute cleanliness.    The clock is ticking from the moment each ice core arrives at the surface. Cosmic rays start to create new radiocarbon atoms that can compromise the final counts.  ""We drill a lot of ice and then we destroy it really quickly in a very precise way to capture those ancient air bubbles that are trapped in the ice,"" says Neff.    It's a surreal sight. In the whiteout of a blizzard, Petrenko and Neff emerge from what looks to be a white circus tent dressed in white cleanroom coveralls, hauling precious blueish cores on a sled behind them to the melter shelter.  Here they process the ice, placing core after core in a giant stainless-steel vessel that looks part space capsule, part pot still.  ""The Hot Tub Time Machine — I thought that was an appropriate descriptor,"" quips Neff. ""Once the hot tub melts the ice, your time machine is there in those air bubbles."" Each of the 20 sled runs sees about half a tonne of ice loaded into the melter, yielding around 50 litres of ancient air per sample for processing back in the US and Australia. The deepest ice is retrieved from about 240 metres, holding air from the world of the 1870s — the time of Ned Kelly, Edison's first lightbulb and the dawn of the Age of Oil.   The problem for scientists is that there is absolutely no hydroxyl left in it. ""The hydroxyl radical is naturally produced in the atmosphere via what's called photochemistry,"" explains Petrenko. ""Hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive. They stick around for typically a small fraction of a second."" It's an instant reaction that helps scrub the atmosphere, but if an OH molecule in 1875 survived for less than a second, how can anyone hope to measure its fleeting existence so many years later?  Hydroxyl might be long gone but the air trapped in the bubbles should retain its lingering radioactive fingerprint in the form of individual carbon 14 atoms of carbon monoxide.    ""Carbon 14 monoxide is produced in the atmosphere through cosmic rays at a rate that we can pretty much understand,"" says Etheridge. ""It's removed almost entirely by hydroxyl. All we need then is to measure the concentration and we can balance the equation and work out the amount of hydroxyl.""  A year later, the processed gas samples arrive in a black plastic case at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Sydney. The timing is profound. Sydney is sweltering under a blanket of smoke from climate-fuelled fires burning up and down the coast. The ice was drilled during Australia's then-hottest summer on record. Now the air from it will be analysed during the Black Summer of 2019.    ""This carbon, if you put a price tag on it, is possibly the most expensive carbon there is on the planet,"" says Andrew Smith from ANSTO's Centre for Accelerator Science. Weight for weight, the atoms might be more expensive than diamond but their value to the world at large could be priceless.  ""Ten million dollars in the slot!"" Smith shouts over the roar of vacuum pumps as he loads a sample carousel into the ion source of the 10 million-volt ANTARES tandem accelerator. ""It's critical that we get this right … otherwise we'll have nothing."" Deep inside the machine, each sample in turn is hammered by a caesium plasma, liberating carbon 14 atoms and shooting them towards the detector at 10 per cent of the speed of light. The ANSTO accelerator runs for 50 straight hours. The tests deliver a good set of data and it's now a matter of interpreting the results. Over the coming months scientists will analyse how well hydroxyl has kept mopping up the pollutants we have been throwing at it over the last 150 years. We'll be able to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through the industrial age.   It could be that the final calculations will reveal hydroxyl continues to clean the atmosphere without hindrance. But the fear is that the ice reveals the opposite.  There will be profound implications if it's found that this detergent has been losing its capacity to clean the atmosphere over time. Climate modellers would need to make corrections for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it might build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter faster than currently predicted. ""We certainly are warming the planet,"" says Petrenko. ""The climate models are predicting [it is] going to result in things like sea-level rise and increases in extreme climate events, which are going to be dangerous and in some cases potentially catastrophic for our civilisation.""   Science, for the most part, is neither quick nor easy. Whether grappling with a viral pandemic or an angry atmosphere, both the scientific process and its practitioners construct an evolving framework of understanding based on evidence.  Now, more than ever, our civilisation depends on it. Watch Atom Hunters of Antarctica on Foreign Correspondent on ABC TV and iview.

16,/news/2020-04-05/adelaide-biennial-monster-theatres-australian-art-taps-into-fear/12118986,Australian artists tap into current fears and past nightmares in Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art,"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's gothic tale Rappacini's Daughter, a young scholar falls in love with the lonely, cloistered daughter of a scientist who specialises in plant-based poisons, only to discover that this young woman — Beatrice — is in fact one of her father's experiments, and has poisoned him by proximity. Beatrice has breath that kills, is deadly to the touch, and has a ""sister"" who is an equally poisonous purple-flowered plant. She is called monstrous by her erstwhile lover — but it's clear to the reader that she is the only really good and innocent character in Hawthorne's tale. Visitors to Adelaide Botanic Gardens in March were able to judge for themselves: Beatrice is currently in residence there, inside the Museum of Economic Botany — where (prior to the COVID-19 shutdown of galleries and museums) she was taking visitors. This Beatrice is plush and purple and tentacled — more creature than woman. Whether visitors found her compelling or repellent might be the subject of artist Julia Robinson's own experiment. The creature's tentacles are covered in lush silk, some of it shot through with iridescence — but this ""skin"" is patterned with small incisions, or gashes, through which nodules of incipient life bulge.   ""My vision of Beatrice is that she's this kind of metamorphic, loud, brash, birthing, splitting and hybridised creature that's trying to break the edges of her boundaries to sort of tease herself out of this mess,"" says Robinson. Beatrice is part of the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, one of more than 120 works by 25 artists presented in an edition themed ""Monster Theatres"", curated by the Art Gallery of South Australia's Leigh Robb. It marks the 30th anniversary of the nation's longest-running survey of Australian art. Robinson was reading a book on poisons when she came across a reference to Rappacini's Daughter.  At that point, Robb had already offered the Adelaide artist a spot within the Museum of Economic Botany — and she felt like serendipity put the idea in her path.  ""I was like 'Oh my God', because it describes Beatrice as this toxic plant-woman,"" Robinson recalls. The setting of the museum is more poignant the longer you look: monstrous and monstered Beatrice is hemmed in by glass cases full of pinned specimens — while just outside the museum, in the gardens, her botanical habitat awaits.   Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein before it, Rappacini's Daughter turns the tables on the reader to reveal that the monster is in fact the man who created the ""monstrous"" being.  That the doctors in both stories care more for science than humankind, and are guided by arrogance rather than compassion, reveals a lot about the era that both authors were writing in.  But more timelessly, these tales reveal the secret truth of monsters: that like beauty, they are in the eye of the beholder; what to one person is monstrous, to another is wonderful. And so this year's Adelaide Biennial becomes a kind of litmus test of our times — for it reveals what each artist, and each audience member, most fears, loathes or rejects (in her curator's essay, Leigh Robb points out that the Latin roots of ""monster"" are the words for ""to warn"" and ""to show""). Robb says she picked the artists before the theme: ""I'd [initially] looked at 10 artists that I wanted to see together, and that I saw as representing really vital strands in Australian contemporary art practice, and ones that had either defined Australian art history or were in the process of reshaping it through pivotal new work, and shapeshifting, interdisciplinary practices.""   She says that the work of this core group of artists revealed common interests and trends: artists using narrative, figuration (as opposed to abstraction) and immersion to sound warnings about, or simply probe, major sources of trauma and anxiety — climate change, colonisation, patriarchy, to name a few biggies. From there, she selected other artists and works that more explicitly fit her theme of ""Monster Theatres"".  The resulting line-up takes us through from pioneering performance artist Mike Parr to young polymath provocateur Abdul Abdullah; from LA and London-based artist Polly Borland (famous for her 90s photo series Adult Babies) to local hero Karla Dickens. This Biennial offers visitors Mike Bianco's quixotic, intimate experience of ""resting with bees"" in the Botanic Gardens, on the one hand, and the spectacular robot-sculpture of veteran performance and body artist Stelarc, on the other.    Some works position themselves in opposition to particular monsters: Hobart-based artist Willoh S. Weiland says ""patriarchy is the monster"", and has created a video tribute to the 300 women, most over the age of 50, who volunteer as guides at the Art Gallery of South Australia. She presents her work inside a curtained, single-person ""shrine"" within the gallery, inviting visitors to pay tribute to these under-recognised (and often ""invisible"") women who mediate many of our experiences with art in the gallery.    In the adjacent gallery space, Sydney artist Abdul Abdullah strikes out against the dynamics of exclusion, with Understudy: a spot-lit microphone on a small stage, with red curtains behind and seating rows in front — and one sole figure sitting expectantly, clothed in head-to-toe fake designer-wear, as if waiting for the main act. Visitors who venture to the front of this faux theatre will see that the figure is a human-primate hybrid with large moist eyes and a snubbed skull-shaped nose — an uneasy mix of endearing and grotesque. Abdullah's work is one of several that pitch their camp at the threshold between horror and wonder, and are made by artists who are subverting mainstream ideas of what is ""monstrous"" or deserving of rejection.   For Perth duo Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, the male-dominated cinema of ""body horror"" is ripe for an intervention: their short film Dark Water taps into tropes of the monstrous feminine, following a grieving young woman into a watery subterranean zone beneath her house, where her body is transformed or re-birthed. The horror in Dark Water draws from a real medical syndrome: when one twin dies in the womb, sometimes the survivor absorbs their body — and carries remnants of their deceased sibling within their body for life.  Dark Water is the third film Coates and Nazzari have made together, and the result of roughly four years of work (including an army of volunteers and an elaborate hand-built backyard aquatic set — from which Coates's lawn hasn't recovered). They spent months making the props, which include the fantastical aquatic lifeforms: ""evolved"" versions of species endemic to Western Australia's coastal waters.   All their work together centres around ideas of women and water — specifically, the mythologies and superstitions around the sea and sailors. They share an interest in the aesthetics of Australian gothic and ""eco horror"", and describe their work as ""oceanic gothic"". For Coates, an interest in the sea stems partly from growing up in the coastal town of Albany (a former whaling town), with a dad who is a diver; Nazzari, conversely, grew up in the landlocked, bone-dry mining town of Kalgoorlie, and developed a fascination with water from the perspective of scarcity. Their interest in horror, meanwhile, is harder to pin down — but Coates says: ""I think both of us — and we've talked about this before — have always had this interest in really looking at things closely, and not looking away. ""I remember as a child, if I saw a dead animal I'd always want to know what happened: How did it die? What did it look like inside? It was that sort of interest in biology; in the blood and guts of what's inside of me.""   They see Dark Water as reclaiming the unique female potential of horror — a genre that has historically been made by and for men. Nazzari says: ""A lot of why women are interested in horror is to do with education and protecting and preserving yourself … We will happily watch the woman holding her car keys and being scared, because in some ways we're thinking — how does that protect you?"" Coates chimes in: ""I think also, when they say that horror and the abject is this unfamiliarity with the insides of our bodies, and this rejection of it — I don't entirely agree with that. I think for women, we're actually not unfamiliar with the insides of our bodies. We bleed every month and we give birth."" Bad scientists and body horror don't just belong to fiction, of course — and one of the Biennial's most compelling works is inspired by a real-life Australian monster. In the Dead House, by Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu peoples), responds to Adelaide Botanic Gardens' dark history as a site where Scottish-born doctor and anthropologist William Ramsay Smith conducted experiments on the corpses of Aboriginal people and ""unclaimed"" bodies, in his position as Adelaide Coroner.    Ramsay Smith's own writings reveal he robbed graves for his collection; he also stole remains from Aboriginal burial grounds. After his death, 182 skulls were found in his home. ""He had this macabre interest in decapitating Aboriginal bodies and sending their remains internationally — mostly to the UK,"" says Scarce. ""Because he was the coroner, it's almost like he had free rein."" Scarce's installation occupies a small square brick building that was formerly a morgue attached to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Inside, 30 bulbous forms in translucent, cloudy glass are arranged in careful rows. Scarce explains that these are ""bush bananas"", endemic to central and western Australia.  Each bulb has been cut open, with the glass curling outwards from each wound, like skin. ""They've been cut open to represent that old way of dissecting bodies. It was really important to show that disrespect [with which Ramsay Smith treated the bodies] — the flaying of the bananas was done very roughly.""   The installation has the feeling of a memorial, and like a lot of Scarce's previous works, it deals with ""unnamed"" victims of historical violence.  Scarce was born in Woomera, South Australia, and has made work about the effects of 20th-century nuclear testing on the Kokatha people and members of her family. ""For me, it's really important that I make work that is about these types of stories,"" she says. The monsters in Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens' work are more abstract but no less real than William Ramsay Smith. Her Dickensian Country Show takes over an entire gallery space and turns it into a ""fun fair"" with a dark twist: there's a ""Colonial Roundabout"", and rides titled ""Live Stock"" and ""Warn a Brother"" — each of these repurposing vintage carnival rides to create sinister allusions.   Around the perimeter of the room, dense collage-work ""posters"" mash up 19th and 20th-century carnival and circus imagery with text to provocative effect: a nightmarish assemblage of monster masks sits alongside hand-written text reading ""True horror is Australia's history of massacring its first people"". Another poster shows Pauline Hanson in a clown nose and a blood-spattered ruff. A spoof of a ""palm reading"" poster reads: ""You don't need a third eye to see the planet's f*%ked."" Koalas are everywhere — lightening the mood, but also avatars for country and environment.  The effect of this maximalist gallery space is almost like a 3D collage. ""Why I love collage so much is that people come in here and it's triggering stuff in their memory,"" says Dickens.  ""Once people's memories are opened a little bit, then their hearts are a bit more engaged.""   A Dickensian Country Show takes as its springboard Australia's chequered Indigenous circus history — from 20th-century ""Wizard of Wire"" Con Colleano (who ""passed"" as Spanish during his career) to boxing tent champs like Jack Hassen and Jerry Jerome.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Indigenous Australians were kidnapped and forced to perform in circuses (including PT Barnum's Greatest Show on Earth), but over the ensuing decades, many of them adapted the form and made it their own — in some cases (like Colleano, who was world famous) turning it to their advantage. ""And the thing about circus too is that people were embraced — the misfits and the outcasts. Your colour or your disabilities were celebrated, not shunned,"" says Dickens. A Dickensian Country Show is a major work, and Dickens has created a counterpart titled A Dickensian Circus in the foyer of the Art Gallery of NSW, as part of the Biennale of Sydney. Work of this scale was only possible thanks to a $80,000 visual arts fellowship from the Copyright Agency, and funding from Create NSW. Next door to Karla Dickens' warped ""country show"" is an assemblage of rocks, rusted steel drums, wire and supersized drill bits that looks vaguely ominous — almost like an instrument of torture. In fact it's an instrument of sound, designed to be played by musicians using modified bows; the rocks are suspended by wires such that they produce different pitches (effectively, it's a very unwieldy string instrument).    Quandamooka artist Megan Cope conceived this instrument as a way to recreate the distinctive, eerie cry of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone curlew, which is often likened to the wailing of a woman or baby. It's a bird that is both native and thriving on her home of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) but endangered in New South Wales and Victoria. For Cope, colonisation, capitalism and our 'extraction mindset' are the monsters.  The seed of the idea for her Biennial work, which is titled Untitled (Death Song), was sown in an earlier sound work, from 2018, in which she built an instrument using rocks from the Newcastle region (the lands of the Awabakal people) ""to enable the elements of country to sing its story of change upon colonisation"".  The drill bits used in Untitled (Death Song) come from mining machinery; the rocks are from the South Australian Museum: ""They're millions of years old … [but] we overlook their knowledge,"" says the artist. When curator Leigh Robb approached Cope about being part of the Monster Theatres exhibition, the artist immediately knew she wanted to produce another sound work — ""because we're just so overstimulated, visually, these days — and we're not really listening to the warnings"". ""And I think there's a lot of warnings [to listen to],"" she adds.  ""In our culture we learn [to hear] those warnings through the process of listening — with your eyes and with your ears."" Cope's hope is that the musicians who play her instrument — who are asked to learn how to mimic the curlew call — are able to ""connect with these deeper concepts in the work, through that process of slowing down and focusing on the call of the bird"".

17,/news/2020-04-05/adelaide-biennial-monster-theatres-australian-art-taps-into-fear/12118986,Australian artists tap into current fears and past nightmares in Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art,"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's gothic tale Rappacini's Daughter, a young scholar falls in love with the lonely, cloistered daughter of a scientist who specialises in plant-based poisons, only to discover that this young woman — Beatrice — is in fact one of her father's experiments, and has poisoned him by proximity. Beatrice has breath that kills, is deadly to the touch, and has a ""sister"" who is an equally poisonous purple-flowered plant. She is called monstrous by her erstwhile lover — but it's clear to the reader that she is the only really good and innocent character in Hawthorne's tale. Visitors to Adelaide Botanic Gardens in March were able to judge for themselves: Beatrice is currently in residence there, inside the Museum of Economic Botany — where (prior to the COVID-19 shutdown of galleries and museums) she was taking visitors. This Beatrice is plush and purple and tentacled — more creature than woman. Whether visitors found her compelling or repellent might be the subject of artist Julia Robinson's own experiment. The creature's tentacles are covered in lush silk, some of it shot through with iridescence — but this ""skin"" is patterned with small incisions, or gashes, through which nodules of incipient life bulge.   ""My vision of Beatrice is that she's this kind of metamorphic, loud, brash, birthing, splitting and hybridised creature that's trying to break the edges of her boundaries to sort of tease herself out of this mess,"" says Robinson. Beatrice is part of the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, one of more than 120 works by 25 artists presented in an edition themed ""Monster Theatres"", curated by the Art Gallery of South Australia's Leigh Robb. It marks the 30th anniversary of the nation's longest-running survey of Australian art. Robinson was reading a book on poisons when she came across a reference to Rappacini's Daughter.  At that point, Robb had already offered the Adelaide artist a spot within the Museum of Economic Botany — and she felt like serendipity put the idea in her path.  ""I was like 'Oh my God', because it describes Beatrice as this toxic plant-woman,"" Robinson recalls. The setting of the museum is more poignant the longer you look: monstrous and monstered Beatrice is hemmed in by glass cases full of pinned specimens — while just outside the museum, in the gardens, her botanical habitat awaits.   Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein before it, Rappacini's Daughter turns the tables on the reader to reveal that the monster is in fact the man who created the ""monstrous"" being.  That the doctors in both stories care more for science than humankind, and are guided by arrogance rather than compassion, reveals a lot about the era that both authors were writing in.  But more timelessly, these tales reveal the secret truth of monsters: that like beauty, they are in the eye of the beholder; what to one person is monstrous, to another is wonderful. And so this year's Adelaide Biennial becomes a kind of litmus test of our times — for it reveals what each artist, and each audience member, most fears, loathes or rejects (in her curator's essay, Leigh Robb points out that the Latin roots of ""monster"" are the words for ""to warn"" and ""to show""). Robb says she picked the artists before the theme: ""I'd [initially] looked at 10 artists that I wanted to see together, and that I saw as representing really vital strands in Australian contemporary art practice, and ones that had either defined Australian art history or were in the process of reshaping it through pivotal new work, and shapeshifting, interdisciplinary practices.""   She says that the work of this core group of artists revealed common interests and trends: artists using narrative, figuration (as opposed to abstraction) and immersion to sound warnings about, or simply probe, major sources of trauma and anxiety — climate change, colonisation, patriarchy, to name a few biggies. From there, she selected other artists and works that more explicitly fit her theme of ""Monster Theatres"".  The resulting line-up takes us through from pioneering performance artist Mike Parr to young polymath provocateur Abdul Abdullah; from LA and London-based artist Polly Borland (famous for her 90s photo series Adult Babies) to local hero Karla Dickens. This Biennial offers visitors Mike Bianco's quixotic, intimate experience of ""resting with bees"" in the Botanic Gardens, on the one hand, and the spectacular robot-sculpture of veteran performance and body artist Stelarc, on the other.    Some works position themselves in opposition to particular monsters: Hobart-based artist Willoh S. Weiland says ""patriarchy is the monster"", and has created a video tribute to the 300 women, most over the age of 50, who volunteer as guides at the Art Gallery of South Australia. She presents her work inside a curtained, single-person ""shrine"" within the gallery, inviting visitors to pay tribute to these under-recognised (and often ""invisible"") women who mediate many of our experiences with art in the gallery.    In the adjacent gallery space, Sydney artist Abdul Abdullah strikes out against the dynamics of exclusion, with Understudy: a spot-lit microphone on a small stage, with red curtains behind and seating rows in front — and one sole figure sitting expectantly, clothed in head-to-toe fake designer-wear, as if waiting for the main act. Visitors who venture to the front of this faux theatre will see that the figure is a human-primate hybrid with large moist eyes and a snubbed skull-shaped nose — an uneasy mix of endearing and grotesque. Abdullah's work is one of several that pitch their camp at the threshold between horror and wonder, and are made by artists who are subverting mainstream ideas of what is ""monstrous"" or deserving of rejection.   For Perth duo Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, the male-dominated cinema of ""body horror"" is ripe for an intervention: their short film Dark Water taps into tropes of the monstrous feminine, following a grieving young woman into a watery subterranean zone beneath her house, where her body is transformed or re-birthed. The horror in Dark Water draws from a real medical syndrome: when one twin dies in the womb, sometimes the survivor absorbs their body — and carries remnants of their deceased sibling within their body for life.  Dark Water is the third film Coates and Nazzari have made together, and the result of roughly four years of work (including an army of volunteers and an elaborate hand-built backyard aquatic set — from which Coates's lawn hasn't recovered). They spent months making the props, which include the fantastical aquatic lifeforms: ""evolved"" versions of species endemic to Western Australia's coastal waters.   All their work together centres around ideas of women and water — specifically, the mythologies and superstitions around the sea and sailors. They share an interest in the aesthetics of Australian gothic and ""eco horror"", and describe their work as ""oceanic gothic"". For Coates, an interest in the sea stems partly from growing up in the coastal town of Albany (a former whaling town), with a dad who is a diver; Nazzari, conversely, grew up in the landlocked, bone-dry mining town of Kalgoorlie, and developed a fascination with water from the perspective of scarcity. Their interest in horror, meanwhile, is harder to pin down — but Coates says: ""I think both of us — and we've talked about this before — have always had this interest in really looking at things closely, and not looking away. ""I remember as a child, if I saw a dead animal I'd always want to know what happened: How did it die? What did it look like inside? It was that sort of interest in biology; in the blood and guts of what's inside of me.""   They see Dark Water as reclaiming the unique female potential of horror — a genre that has historically been made by and for men. Nazzari says: ""A lot of why women are interested in horror is to do with education and protecting and preserving yourself … We will happily watch the woman holding her car keys and being scared, because in some ways we're thinking — how does that protect you?"" Coates chimes in: ""I think also, when they say that horror and the abject is this unfamiliarity with the insides of our bodies, and this rejection of it — I don't entirely agree with that. I think for women, we're actually not unfamiliar with the insides of our bodies. We bleed every month and we give birth."" Bad scientists and body horror don't just belong to fiction, of course — and one of the Biennial's most compelling works is inspired by a real-life Australian monster. In the Dead House, by Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu peoples), responds to Adelaide Botanic Gardens' dark history as a site where Scottish-born doctor and anthropologist William Ramsay Smith conducted experiments on the corpses of Aboriginal people and ""unclaimed"" bodies, in his position as Adelaide Coroner.    Ramsay Smith's own writings reveal he robbed graves for his collection; he also stole remains from Aboriginal burial grounds. After his death, 182 skulls were found in his home. ""He had this macabre interest in decapitating Aboriginal bodies and sending their remains internationally — mostly to the UK,"" says Scarce. ""Because he was the coroner, it's almost like he had free rein."" Scarce's installation occupies a small square brick building that was formerly a morgue attached to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Inside, 30 bulbous forms in translucent, cloudy glass are arranged in careful rows. Scarce explains that these are ""bush bananas"", endemic to central and western Australia.  Each bulb has been cut open, with the glass curling outwards from each wound, like skin. ""They've been cut open to represent that old way of dissecting bodies. It was really important to show that disrespect [with which Ramsay Smith treated the bodies] — the flaying of the bananas was done very roughly.""

On a sandy islet engulfed by greenery, Esther lives under constant threat. But it's not violence she's most concerned about — it's disease.  Not coronavirus — Kiribati is one of the few countries without a single case. But the threat of disease hounds Betio, the most populated section of South Tarawa, an island in Kiribati, where there are around 15,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. To put it into perspective, that's 2.5 times the density of Tokyo. ""The beach used to be way back there — I don't know how many houses have been lost but it's a lot,"" says Esther, who moved to Betio from a remote island with her family. ""Now everyone is crowding into this area. There's no privacy, people are going to the toilet on the beach, and there's the constant threat of disease outbreaks.""   Here, families live in open shacks on around four square metres of land, where the distance between houses is a matter of centimetres.  These sorts of crowded conditions contribute to some of the worst health outcomes in the Pacific: tuberculosis and leprosy are rife in Betio, with thousands of cases detected and treated each year.  Few countries are more vulnerable to the effects of global warming than the Pacific islands of Kiribati.  A group of atolls spread across millions of square kilometres of ocean, the islands have lost more than 10 per cent of their land in just two years.    Kiribati is made of sand and reef rock, materials that easily erode, causing houses built close to the water to collapse when there's a strong storm.  There's no basis to build strong foundations, and those families who become homeless due to erosion have to find a new block of land further inland.  ""There's currently no provision for land lost to erosion, and while we have ordinances for land use in places like Betio, they're not being enforced,"" says Taneka Redfern from the Office of the President. The constant scramble to find a place to live has meant that parts of South Tarawa have the among the highest population density in the world.   In the absence of other options, residents of Kiribati are putting their faith in sea walls. All over the island, young people are bringing in cement and rocks to build up new walls that will stop the tides from reaching their houses, however temporarily.    There's also a plan to dredge up millions of tons of sand from the lagoon and move it to a section of the island that can be built up to three metres in height, in theory providing space for 35,000 people to live.  In the meantime, people are living with the everyday reality that their land is disappearing.  ""The President doesn't want us to move, and the only place we could go would be Ocean Island (a remote island only accessible by ship), but that won't work,"" says Teakamatang, a community leader in Tebikenikora, or Golden Beach. ""We need a sea wall that will last at least 20 years... Hopefully by then we'll have a better idea about what we can do.""   For younger people, who can't remember the way the island used to be, there's a greater degree of complacency.  Christina, from Tebikenikora, says that while young people build sea walls, they're mostly doing it because they're told to by their elders.    The 28-year-old adds that she can't see a future for her and her husband in Kiribati, although she doesn't know where else she would go.  ""The sea wall will protect us, but everyone will only work hard when there's an emergency — it's really hard work,"" she said.  ""It's the elderly people who are angry — they can remember a time when they could live off the land."" For those that have felt the effects of the growing crisis, however, the need for action cannot be understated. After Betio hospital — which handles up to 60 births each month — found itself at the mercy of the elements four years ago, the concrete sea wall proved a lifeline.   ""We had a storm and the water came all the way into the hospital. We had women giving birth, or recovering with their newborns, and they all just had to run,"" says midwife Makita. ""There were three new mums asleep in the clinic when a massive wave bashed against the window. It was really frightening for them."" With finite land on Kiribati, the country's woes demonstrate the challenging nexus of climate change and overpopulation. And it's not a problem likely to end anytime soon.    According to the World Meteorological Organisation and climate scientists globally, extreme weather events are becoming much more frequent. For Kiribati, this means extreme storms and droughts. Storms cause flooding, and on such flat land, floods can devastate thousands of homes very quickly.  There have already been two floods this year. Teakamatang, who has witnessed the waters rising over the past 30 years, does not mince words. ""If nothing is done, we will disappear.""  ",By Carly Learson,"April 05, 2020"

There's no basis to build strong foundations, and those families who become homeless due to erosion have to find a new block of land further inland.  ""There's currently no provision for land lost to erosion, and while we have ordinances for land use in places like Betio, they're not being enforced,"" says Taneka Redfern from the Office of the President. The constant scramble to find a place to live has meant that parts of South Tarawa have the among the highest population density in the world.   In the absence of other options, residents of Kiribati are putting their faith in sea walls. All over the island, young people are bringing in cement and rocks to build up new walls that will stop the tides from reaching their houses, however temporarily.    There's also a plan to dredge up millions of tons of sand from the lagoon and move it to a section of the island that can be built up to three metres in height, in theory providing space for 35,000 people to live.  In the meantime, people are living with the everyday reality that their land is disappearing.  ""The President doesn't want us to move, and the only place we could go would be Ocean Island (a remote island only accessible by ship), but that won't work,"" says Teakamatang, a community leader in Tebikenikora, or Golden Beach. ""We need a sea wall that will last at least 20 years... Hopefully by then we'll have a better idea about what we can do.""   For younger people, who can't remember the way the island used to be, there's a greater degree of complacency.  Christina, from Tebikenikora, says that while young people build sea walls, they're mostly doing it because they're told to by their elders.    The 28-year-old adds that she can't see a future for her and her husband in Kiribati, although she doesn't know where else she would go.  ""The sea wall will protect us, but everyone will only work hard when there's an emergency — it's really hard work,"" she said.  ""It's the elderly people who are angry — they can remember a time when they could live off the land."" For those that have felt the effects of the growing crisis, however, the need for action cannot be understated. After Betio hospital — which handles up to 60 births each month — found itself at the mercy of the elements four years ago, the concrete sea wall proved a lifeline.   ""We had a storm and the water came all the way into the hospital. We had women giving birth, or recovering with their newborns, and they all just had to run,"" says midwife Makita. ""There were three new mums asleep in the clinic when a massive wave bashed against the window. It was really frightening for them."" With finite land on Kiribati, the country's woes demonstrate the challenging nexus of climate change and overpopulation. And it's not a problem likely to end anytime soon.    According to the World Meteorological Organisation and climate scientists globally, extreme weather events are becoming much more frequent. For Kiribati, this means extreme storms and droughts. Storms cause flooding, and on such flat land, floods can devastate thousands of homes very quickly.  There have already been two floods this year. Teakamatang, who has witnessed the waters rising over the past 30 years, does not mince words. ""If nothing is done, we will disappear.""  ",By Carly Learson,"April 05, 2020"

A Western Sydney school has closed and classes have gone online after a student tested positive for coronavirus. Representatives from St Mary's Senior High School have been working with NSW Health to map out the people the student came into close contact with. Under advice from NSW Health, all staff and around 900 students were told to self-isolate until the contact-tracing process was complete.   The Department of Education said it was not yet clear when the school would re-open. A woman will face court today charged with breaching a health order after she allegedly coughed on people in the Snowy Mountains region. Police arrested the 41-year-old after she allegedly deliberately coughed on several people on a street in Cooma, including a woman and a young child. She was charged with breaching a public health order and two counts of stalking and intimidating with intent to cause fear or physical harm. She was refused bail and will face Wollongong Local Court today via video link. Three people have been fined for flouting the state's tough new social gathering laws. Upon receiving an infringement notice for breaking the new public health order, a 39-year-old Chester Hill man told police: ""It's just a virus, it's not that bad"". NSW Police Commissioner Michael Fuller said officers were using their discretion but were not afraid to use the additional powers to help curb the spread of coronavirus. ""I'd encourage people to continue to do the right thing without the need for police involvement,"" Commissioner Fuller said.   Frontline healthcare workers in Sydney have turned to Facebook to find places to live away from their families to protect them from coronavirus. Rose Ybanez is a nurse at Sydney Adventist Hospital with an eight-month-old baby and lives with her 72-year-old mother, who has pre-existing medical conditions. ""If I did get infected I have nowhere else to go, we don't have a spare room,"" Ms Ybanez said. Australia's carbon emissions from air travel could be cut in half due to the coronavirus pandemic, a reduction of 13.2 megatonnes of CO2 in the air this year, according to a new study released today.

When Yoda was delivered to the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre in November 2019 she was covered in barnacles, was sunburnt, dehydrated and weighing a measly 87 kilograms.  But in the five months since then Yoda has made a full recovery and packed on 30 kilograms. The centre has rescued and rehabilitated more than 200 turtles since 2011 and owner, Bob McCosker, said Yoda was the most interactive of them all. ""She just loved her scratches and tickles and she would grab your hand with her rear flippers and hold on while you scratched her,"" he said.  ""She's just loved human interaction.""   Marine biologist, Liam Turner, has been a caretaker at the turtle rehabilitation centre since Yoda was brought into care. ""She's a bit different to everybody else — she's the equivalent of a labrador under the water,"" he said. ""Since she's started to get a bit healthier, she's started to get a little less touchy feely with us, which is a good sign that she's sick of her pool life and she wants to go back into the wild."" Green sea turtles normally feast on seagrasses and algae in the wild, but sick turtles need extra protein to recover. Mr Turner said Yoda was not fussed about becoming a carnivore. ""She was obviously quite underweight when she got here, quite skinny, so she had a while to go in terms of putting on all that weight,"" he said.  ""She took to eating squid pretty quickly though, within a few days she was eating. ""She was like a hoover vacuum. As soon as she started eating she was just putting on weight."" Yoda transitioned from the centre's intensive care tanks into the pool in a matter of weeks.   Yoda's release was particularly special for Mr Turner and his wife, Hayley Coen, as it was the first large turtle they had released since becoming caretakers on the island.  ""It's a rewarding feeling seeing a turtle come in and see it go out the other side,"" he said. ""This might sound weird but I don't want to see her again — I mean that in a good way."" Although Mr McCosker has rehabilitated many turtles in the last nine years, he still felt a mixture of happiness and sadness to see Yoda make her way into the ocean. ""I just hope that she doesn't run into a fisherman or a boat, that's the primary thing,"" he said. ""I hope that she lays lots of eggs. ""In the next 10 to 20 years of her life that's still left, she'll nest at potentially another 10 times — that's potentially another thousand eggs. ""So out of that, one turtle can survive.""    Mr McCosker said recreational fisherman were the most common threat to turtles like Yoda. ""That's the biggest danger in the ocean,"" he said. ""They kill thousands of these animals every year and they know nothing about it."" Mr McCosker said it was not fisherman trying to catch the endangered turtles that was the biggest concern. ""There's a constant risk with discarded fishing line, where people have cut off 50 or 100 metres at a time, they get wrapped in it. ""We've got a number of animals with amputated limbs because of it. ""It's not just the fishing hook, it's the fishing lines that they leave behind and the boat strikes.""   Mr McCosker hopes Yoda's release sends a message to those out on the water. ""Bring your rubbish home,"" he said.  ""Don't let the fishing line stay in the water, or the hooks or the crab pots. ""Fishing line; it's going to stay there for another 1,000 years so we've got that issue to face over a long, long time yet, so just be careful. Be mindful.""",ABC Capricornia      By Erin Semmler,"March 30, 2020"

Yoda transitioned from the centre's intensive care tanks into the pool in a matter of weeks.   Yoda's release was particularly special for Mr Turner and his wife, Hayley Coen, as it was the first large turtle they had released since becoming caretakers on the island.  ""It's a rewarding feeling seeing a turtle come in and see it go out the other side,"" he said. ""This might sound weird but I don't want to see her again — I mean that in a good way."" Although Mr McCosker has rehabilitated many turtles in the last nine years, he still felt a mixture of happiness and sadness to see Yoda make her way into the ocean. ""I just hope that she doesn't run into a fisherman or a boat, that's the primary thing,"" he said. ""I hope that she lays lots of eggs. ""In the next 10 to 20 years of her life that's still left, she'll nest at potentially another 10 times — that's potentially another thousand eggs. ""So out of that, one turtle can survive.""    Mr McCosker said recreational fisherman were the most common threat to turtles like Yoda. ""That's the biggest danger in the ocean,"" he said. ""They kill thousands of these animals every year and they know nothing about it."" Mr McCosker said it was not fisherman trying to catch the endangered turtles that was the biggest concern. ""There's a constant risk with discarded fishing line, where people have cut off 50 or 100 metres at a time, they get wrapped in it. ""We've got a number of animals with amputated limbs because of it. ""It's not just the fishing hook, it's the fishing lines that they leave behind and the boat strikes.""   Mr McCosker hopes Yoda's release sends a message to those out on the water. ""Bring your rubbish home,"" he said.  ""Don't let the fishing line stay in the water, or the hooks or the crab pots. ""Fishing line; it's going to stay there for another 1,000 years so we've got that issue to face over a long, long time yet, so just be careful. Be mindful.""",ABC Capricornia      By Erin Semmler,"March 30, 2020"

The grower-led company SunRice will produce about 5 per cent of its average rice production this year, and is relying on overseas product to meet demand domestically and for export markets. Chief executive officer Rob Gordon said panic buying of rice had put enormous strain on the company's facilities. ""We've got orders for 250 per cent of normal and obviously we don't have the spare capacity to be able to produce that, but we are flexing our supply chains,"" Mr Gordon said. ""We are importing rice from different parts of the world for the Australian market even though we normally sell Australian rice here. ""Clearly that will be very clearly labelled so consumers can understand that we've had to source rice from somewhere else."" Mr Gordon said the company would secure enough rice from overseas suppliers to satisfy demand for an estimated 1.2 million tonnes in sales to about 50 countries this year.   This will be further complicated by the Vietnamese Government announcing that all rice exports will be banned from May 31 to protect its domestic supply, affecting the company's milling operations in that country.  Fewer than 70 Australian growers will harvest crops in the coming weeks, out of close to 800 producers in a good season. Prolonged drought and water reform is likely to see production fall below last year's 54,000 tonnes, the second lowest crop on record. In a good year, SunRice injects up to $500 million into the New South Wales economy in wages and payments to growers and local suppliers. This year the company laid off 250 workers, and the impact of that reduced economic activity has hit the Riverina region hard. The Mayor of Leeton, Paul Maytom, said governments needed to understand that the value of rice to local communities extended far beyond its farm-gate return. ""It should not be about who can pay the highest price for water; it should be about what will it cost our communities if we cannot sustain that diversity of irrigated agriculture that we have, which then moves into the value-added side, which then moves into employment and then sustains our whole community,"" Mr Maytom said.   Under water reforms, the environment and permanent crops, such as almonds, grapes and citrus, get water allocated before annual crops such as rice, cotton and cereals. SunRice chairman Laurie Arthur said annual crop irrigators felt under siege. About 500 have joined a $1.5-billion class action against the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, but he is urging calm. Mr Arthur is one of the state's biggest rice growers and a former national water commissioner. He said he understood grower frustration, but hoped state and commonwealth governments would make more water available for low-security irrigation. ""One of the reasons the irrigation community supported the reform process was the concept of property rights, transparency of process and a framework of water entitlements that give the sector confidence to invest to world's best practise,"" he said. ""Some of those have been delivered and some have demonstrably not been delivered. ""The government now holds 28 per cent of all the allocations in the Basin, so they are enormous users, and I believe they have the ability to correct the situation."" There are a number of big reports on water reform policy due in the coming months.   They include reviews of the water market, water sharing, socio-economic impacts and water for the environment. New Minister for Water, Keith Pitt, said the reports would provide important insights into water reform and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

Meg Ulman and Patrick Jones, from Daylesford, now use a squat composting toilet and 'family cloths' — reusable wipes made from flannel. They made the change when they realised the popular toilet paper delivery service they used manufactured their rolls in China. The flannel is from a local op shop and has been going strong for five years. After each wipe, the cloth is put into a bucket beside the toilet — with optional eucalyptus oil — and every five days to a week, the family cloth takes a spin in a front loader washing machine at maximum heat. After being washed, the family cloth is dried on an outdoors clothes horse. It is just one in a series of changes the couple has made over the course of a decade, including giving up shopping at supermarkets, giving up their car, and turning off the gas at home in favour of a wood heater. ""It's to save money; it's to save resources,"" Ms Ulman said. ""We want to be intimately involved in our processes; everything we do we want to be intimately involved in."" Ms Ulman advises families thinking about taking the plunge to family cloths to take it one step at a time to make each new habit stick.     Toilet paper panic buying has caused a range of problems around Australia, including environmental ones. Plumbing problems occur when newspaper, baby wipes, kitchen paper, tissues and even tea towels are flushed as alternatives to toilet paper. Australians have been warned they could end up with faeces on the bathroom floor if sewers continued to block up. In eastern Victoria's Gippsland region, the number of sewer blockages has tripled since February. ""When it's blocked there's nowhere for what's coming into the system to go, so it can go back up into houses so none of those scenarios are good ones,"" Gippsland Water managing director Sarah Cumming said.   Ms Cumming said crews were finding all sorts of things in the fatbergs they dragged up out of the sewers — including underpants.   In south-east Melbourne, water authorities are also grappling with an increase in fatbergs, due to wet wipes, cotton balls, and rags blocking sewers. ""If you must use different products in place of toilet paper, please put these in the bin instead of flushing them,"" South East Water general manager, customer service Terry Schubach said.  Melbourne Water's executive general manager service delivery Nerina Di Lorenzo said even so-called flushable wipes clogged up the sewerage system.

""They regard where I went as being even more remote than the Moon, because it is such an exercise to get there. It was phenomenal to be part of it,"" Ms Haynes said.  ""I think the coldest it got was about -5C, but then you have to add wind chill. The wind is extraordinary in Antarctica and it can get very strong.""   King George Island is the largest of the South Shetland Islands, lying 120 kilometres off the coast of Antarctica.

""I did actually stand next to glaciers that were melting and you could see the drips coming down, in some cases pouring water like a tap,"" Ms Haynes said.   Bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species and absorb nutrients from the environment and photosynthesise to create the sugars required for energy.

38,/news/2020-03-28/coronavirus-infectious-disease-and-climate-change/12084340,"Coronavirus crisis elicits fresh look at the future of diseases, medicine and climate change     ","As humanity branches out further across our interconnected and warming world, we are putting ourselves at risk of encountering new diseases.  Thankfully, we are getting better at fighting back.   The experts consulted for this article were unanimous: there is no indication coronavirus has been directly connected to climate change.  There is, however, a number of infectious diseases that are affected by a warming world, and the indirect consequences of climate and environmental change are far-reaching.  ""There's very good evidence that bacterial food-borne infections increase in warmer times and therefore are likely to increase with climate change,"" said Linda Selvey from the school of public health at the University of Queensland. Animal-borne diseases are also likely to change with the climate as the distribution of infectious species changes.    Mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and yellow fever are expected to expand into currently temperate regions as they warm. Dr Selvey said Lyme disease (from ticks), for example, was likely to be spreading in North America because of climate change. But with COVID-19 going around, it is human-to-human diseases that are the focus of the world's attention.  The influenza (flu) virus, which spreads in a similar way to COVID-19, is not showing trends of either decreasing or increasing case numbers that could be ascribed to climate change, according to Dr Selvey.  The flu does have a winter-time peak in temperate regions, but as it is still present at similar rates in warm, tropical climates, there is no indication the overall flu rate will decline as the world warms.  Dr Selvey did say there was potential for the temporal distribution of flu to change as wealthy regions warmed and we all congregated inside with air conditioning, where flu could spread easier, leading to a summer flu peak.  Time will tell, so at the moment it is not looking like there is a direct link between respiratory diseases and climate change ... but there could be indirect relations.    It is common for viruses spread from human to human to cause colds and the flu, but a degree of immunity in the population, and the fact they are regular occurrences, means our healthcare system is capable of handling the caseload.  It is when something new like COVID-19 comes along that we need to worry.  These new diseases can occur when viruses cross from animals to humans, who then pass it on to others. Some notable examples include swine flu (2009 H1N1), which is believed to have descended from a virus that infected pigs, and the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, which is thought to be linked to bats.  It is yet to be determined from which species COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2 virus) has come to us; the prime suspects are bats, snakes, turtles and pangolins — or a combination of these.   As with animal-borne diseases, changes in the climate are likely to affect the distribution of these potential cross-over species.  Take birds, another common culprit.  ""When we have an avian influenza strain crossing over into the human population, that's where we're really worried about a pandemic,"" said Kirsty Short, a research fellow at UQ's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences.  ""Those migratory patterns of birds, and how often birds come in contact with humans, is actually directly influenced by the weather.  ""We are seeing those migration patterns change with climate change.""   Then there is how our human distribution is changing. ""As we have climate change, we have obviously more destruction of natural spaces, deforestation and so forth,"" Dr Short said. ""What we see is that people are encroaching more and more upon spaces that they previously didn't inhabit.""  This is a danger because it means we are coming into contact with viruses that our immune systems have never seen.  ""So in that sense, the environmental destruction associated with climate change can actually lead to an increased incidence of zoonosis, or animal viruses, jumping the species barrier and crossing over into humans,"" Dr Short said.    On top of that, our interconnected modern world means we're probably becoming more vulnerable to infectious diseases spreading. ""We've certainly seen that with this [COVID-19] pandemic,"" Dr Short said. The good news is that we are getting better at fighting back. ""Even though climate change and all the changes that we're going through is putting additional strain on the system, we're also coming up with new and innovative ways to fight infectious diseases,"" Dr Short said.  There had been a dramatic increase in surveillance, detection technologies and the ability to develop vaccines, she said. ""It is a little bit of a competition to see who wins. ""The first coronavirus vaccine has already gone into human trials; that would be unheard of even 10 years ago.""  There are trials using initiative new methods to create coronavirus vaccines at a record pace, but before you stop washing your hands, it is still likely to be at least a year (if successful) before they are ready for widespread distribution.      It is not as simple as saying all disease will increase or decrease with climate change.  ""I think it's more that they'll be different in different areas and at different times and some infectious diseases will increase,"" Dr Selvey said.  ""It's possible that some may decrease."" But she said there were ""many, many"" other ways that climate change was highly detrimental to our health.  ""Infectious diseases are just one of the many ways that our changing climate is impacting on humans.""    ",ABC Weather      By Kate Doyle,"March 28, 2020"

But with COVID-19 going around, it is human-to-human diseases that are the focus of the world's attention.  The influenza (flu) virus, which spreads in a similar way to COVID-19, is not showing trends of either decreasing or increasing case numbers that could be ascribed to climate change, according to Dr Selvey.  The flu does have a winter-time peak in temperate regions, but as it is still present at similar rates in warm, tropical climates, there is no indication the overall flu rate will decline as the world warms.  Dr Selvey did say there was potential for the temporal distribution of flu to change as wealthy regions warmed and we all congregated inside with air conditioning, where flu could spread easier, leading to a summer flu peak.  Time will tell, so at the moment it is not looking like there is a direct link between respiratory diseases and climate change ... but there could be indirect relations.    It is common for viruses spread from human to human to cause colds and the flu, but a degree of immunity in the population, and the fact they are regular occurrences, means our healthcare system is capable of handling the caseload.  It is when something new like COVID-19 comes along that we need to worry.  These new diseases can occur when viruses cross from animals to humans, who then pass it on to others. Some notable examples include swine flu (2009 H1N1), which is believed to have descended from a virus that infected pigs, and the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, which is thought to be linked to bats.  It is yet to be determined from which species COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2 virus) has come to us; the prime suspects are bats, snakes, turtles and pangolins — or a combination of these.   As with animal-borne diseases, changes in the climate are likely to affect the distribution of these potential cross-over species.  Take birds, another common culprit.  ""When we have an avian influenza strain crossing over into the human population, that's where we're really worried about a pandemic,"" said Kirsty Short, a research fellow at UQ's school of chemistry and molecular biosciences.  ""Those migratory patterns of birds, and how often birds come in contact with humans, is actually directly influenced by the weather.  ""We are seeing those migration patterns change with climate change.""   Then there is how our human distribution is changing. ""As we have climate change, we have obviously more destruction of natural spaces, deforestation and so forth,"" Dr Short said. ""What we see is that people are encroaching more and more upon spaces that they previously didn't inhabit.""  This is a danger because it means we are coming into contact with viruses that our immune systems have never seen.  ""So in that sense, the environmental destruction associated with climate change can actually lead to an increased incidence of zoonosis, or animal viruses, jumping the species barrier and crossing over into humans,"" Dr Short said.    On top of that, our interconnected modern world means we're probably becoming more vulnerable to infectious diseases spreading. ""We've certainly seen that with this [COVID-19] pandemic,"" Dr Short said. The good news is that we are getting better at fighting back. ""Even though climate change and all the changes that we're going through is putting additional strain on the system, we're also coming up with new and innovative ways to fight infectious diseases,"" Dr Short said.  There had been a dramatic increase in surveillance, detection technologies and the ability to develop vaccines, she said. ""It is a little bit of a competition to see who wins. ""The first coronavirus vaccine has already gone into human trials; that would be unheard of even 10 years ago.""  There are trials using initiative new methods to create coronavirus vaccines at a record pace, but before you stop washing your hands, it is still likely to be at least a year (if successful) before they are ready for widespread distribution.      It is not as simple as saying all disease will increase or decrease with climate change.  ""I think it's more that they'll be different in different areas and at different times and some infectious diseases will increase,"" Dr Selvey said.  ""It's possible that some may decrease."" But she said there were ""many, many"" other ways that climate change was highly detrimental to our health.  ""Infectious diseases are just one of the many ways that our changing climate is impacting on humans.""    ",ABC Weather      By Kate Doyle,"March 28, 2020"
40,/news/2020-03-27/ipswich-city-council-election-dump/12094360,Voters prepare to elect new Ipswich City Council amid anti-dump sentiment,"It has been more than 18 months since the Ipswich City Council was sacked by the Queensland Government amid corruption and bullying allegations.   This weekend the city will prepare to elect a new council to take over the current administration, which many hope will help the city move beyond its reputation of corruption and that of a waste capital. Chad Hayes from the anti-dump Willowbank Action Group said there were currently up to five applications in the works for waste facilities at the site of the former Jeebropilly Mine. Mr Hayes said the deep mining voids that were left behind when mining operations finished up decades ago were sought after by waste companies.  ""The dumps are a cheap option [to rehabilitate the land],"" Mr Hayes said. ""Residents don't want leachate ponds, 750 metres from the closest houses. Open leachate ponds which actually send smells and could potentially create health issues."" He said if the development application by the company Lantrack was successful in a court of appeal, 190 additional trucks carrying construction waste could be put on local roads around Willowbank and Amberley.   ""We don't have the road infrastructure to cope with these industries,"" he said.  ""We want to see councillors that are against these dumps, but want jobs and infrastructure. Dumps aren't the jobs for the Ipswich area.""  Mr Hayes said future councillors needed to fight dumps on behalf of residents. ""If the Ipswich City Council doesn't win the [Lantrack] court case, these other waste companies will just roll into town and we will just become Tipswich —  not Ipswich — the city of growth,"" he said. Geoff Yarham, secretary of the group Ipswich Residents Against Toxic Environments, said in its former life the city was the dumping capital of Australia.  ""I think we have got to this point now because the people of Ipswich were unaware exactly what was going on,"" Mr Yarham said.  ""Every week we have a very good look at what applications for dumps are being made. We have been able to make a lot of submissions against the dumps, when previously they were just waved through because there were no objections.""  An Ipswich City Council spokesman said in the last three years seven development applications for landfills were received, and three are currently in the Planning and Environment Court.  ""Owing to the magnitude of issues that will need to be worked through by experts, it is likely that the three remaining landfill appeals will drag on for quite some time and will place a significant financial burden on council,"" the spokesman said.   Mr Yarham said companies needed to look at decisions that have been made and strongly reconsider applications.  ""Instead of taking the ratepayers to task and saying, 'We are going to appeal this decision', understand that the laws have changed and therefore they shouldn't worry about appeal,"" Mr Yarham said. ""If you look at the reasons for the refusal of an application they are always well argued by the planning department. In the case of Bio-Recycle, it has already gone to appeal and the appeal has been lost so that is becoming the template for future companies."" Mr Yarham said he was confident the new Temporary Local Planning Instrument (TLPI), which aims to regulate waste activity, would give greater scrutiny to new facilities and applications for expansions.  ""New councillors will hopefully have a clean slate,"" he said. Political commentator, Dr Paul Williams from Griffith University, said voters in the Ipswich City Council elections would feel ""jaded"" after seeing two mayors investigated for corruption and an entire council sacked. ""This re-enforces that idea that they want clean skins and who are ordinary just like them, down to earth people who are getting on with the job,"" Dr Williams said. ""I think this election for Ipswich and other regional councils is a real turning point. Given the catharsis we have seen in the last few years, voters are looking for a change. ""The bar of public integrity and public behaviour of local councillors and mayors, particularly outside Brisbane, will be particularly high."" ",By Baz Ruddick,"March 27, 2020"

The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) will prosecute Belgium-based Nyrstar Port Pirie Pty Ltd in the Environment, Resources and Development (ERD) Court for allegedly causing serious environmental harm. The EPA will allege Nyrstar polluted the environment by ""discharging, or failing to prevent the discharge of, about 700 litres of sulphuric acid"" from its smelter into First Creek between January 31 and February 3 last year. ""Potential environmental harm was caused by polluting the environment and creating harmful conditions for fish and other plant and animal life in the creek,"" the EPA said in a statement. In a statement, Nyrstar confirmed the EPA had issued it with a summons to appear in court. ""Following the incident Nyrstar implemented new processes and alarms,"" it stated. ""Nyrstar does not intend to provide ongoing commentary in relation to this matter given it involves legal proceedings."" In October 2019, ABC News questioned the company over allegations mass fish deaths had occurred in a breeding ground near the factory site. At the time, Nyrstar said ""the incident occurred following the failure of a valve and ultimately resulted in a discharge into the water course"". ""No persisting environmental impact was observed. Nyrstar has subsequently implemented new processes and alarms,"" it said. Documents from the EPA, released under Freedom of Information, alleged sulfuric acid leaked from Nyrstar's factory into Port Pirie's First Creek on January 31. The EPA refused to release a summary of the incident, however February briefings to South Australia's Primary Industries Minister Tim Whetstone said ""localised fish kills"" had occurred in mangroves, with State Government investigators unable to assess the damage for at least five days after the spill. Parliamentary briefing notes were prepared for ministers and media statements were prepared, but no public announcement was made. Local net fisherman David Wilkes, who reported the alleged January sulfuric acid leak, said the smelter was important to the town, but called for greater transparency to ensure the environment was kept clean. He said alleged leaks had been the subject of discussion in the community, but there had been no formal notification from the State Government or Nyrstar. ""The marine environment is important to us, as a community and myself personally, because it affects my livelihood,"" he said.
