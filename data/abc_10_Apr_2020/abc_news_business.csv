The Australian dollar jumped to a one-month high of 63.4 US cents this morning as the record Fed stimulus weakened the greenback. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the world's biggest oil producers have struck a deal to cut production by a record amount (10 million barrels per day), but that was not enough to prevent a further slump in oil prices.   The Australian share market is closed for the Easter long weekend, but might enjoy solid gains when it reopens next Tuesday. It may follow a strong lead from Wall Street's benchmark index (the S&P 500), which surged by 12 per cent this week — its biggest weekly gain since 1974. Overnight, the S&P index added 1.5 per cent to close at 2,790 points. The industrial-skewed Dow Jones index lifted by 286 points (or 1.2 per cent) to 23,719, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 8,154. European markets also jumped. London's FTSE and Germany's DAX were up by 2.8 and 2.2 per cent respectively. The spot price of gold also surged to a one-month high, around $US1,684 an ounce. Global markets were propped up by hope the number of new coronavirus cases was slowing down and the latest announcement from the US central bank on further stimulus being pumped into the system. The Fed said it would allocate a massive $US2.3 trillion ($3.6 trillion) to further shield the US economy from the economic damage from coronavirus.   It had already cut interest rates to almost zero and re-launched its quantitative easing program in March, pledging to buy an unlimited number of bonds. Under its latest stimulus measures, the Fed will offer four-year loans, through the banks, to struggling American businesses. This new ""Main Street"" facility will funnel up to $US600 billion in loans (of at least $US1 million) to companies that have up to 10,000 employees or less than $US2.5 billion in revenue. Firms receiving the loans ""must commit to make reasonable efforts to maintain payroll and retain workers"" and not use the funds to refinance existing debt. The central bank will also spend up to $US500 billion purchasing municipal bonds from local governments, which are on the front lines of the health crisis and are also facing a possible collapse in their tax revenue as unemployment spikes and businesses shut under tough social-distancing rules. Many of these programs are due to lapse in September, but Fed chair Jerome Powell said the Fed would spend whatever it takes to get the pandemic under control and get the economy back on track. ""We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent,"" Mr Powell said. ""We will continue to use these powers forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery."" It was enough to make investors ignore the bad news — that 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance claims last week, according to figures released by the US Labor Department. That brought the total to 16.8 million people who had lost their jobs in the past three weeks.   The record number of applications for unemployment benefits are the result of businesses such as restaurants, bars and other social venues being closed. ""In its first month alone, the coronavirus crisis is poised to exceed any comparison to the [2008] Great Recession,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, an online recruitment firm. ""The new normal for unemployment insurance claims will be the canary in the coal mine for how long effects of the crisis will linger for the millions of newly unemployed Americans."" The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed on Thursday to cut oil output by a record 10 million barrels per day (or 10 per cent of global supplies) for two months. All members will reduce their output by 23 per cent, with Saudi Arabia and Russia each cutting 2.5 million bpd and Iraq cutting over 1 million bpd. But the price of Brent crude tumbled by 2.5 per cent to $US32 a barrel. Its value has plummeted by half since the year began. Investors are worried these supply cuts still won't be enough to combat the unprecedented plunge in oil demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   OPEC+, which includes non-members like Russia, is also expecting the US and other producers to join in its effort to cut production (by 5 million bpd) and prop up prices to help deal with the deepest oil crisis in decades. Global fuel demand has plunged by around 30 million bpd (or 30pc of global supplies) as steps to fight the virus have grounded planes, cut vehicle usage and curbed economic activity. If an unprecedented 15 million bpd cut were to happen, it would not be enough to stop the world's storage facilities quickly filling up. And far from signalling any readiness to offer support, US President Donald Trump has threatened OPEC member Saudi Arabia, saying it could face sanctions and tariffs if it does not cut supply enough to help the struggling US oil industry. ""We are expecting other producers outside the OPEC+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow during G20,"" the head of Russia's wealth fund (and one of Moscow's top oil negotiators), Kirill Dmitriev, told Reuters. On Friday Saudi Arabia will host a call between energy ministers from the Group of 20 major economies.","By business reporter David Chau, wires","April 10, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-10/imf-tips-coronavirus-causing-worst-downturn-since-depression/12140392?section=business,"Coronavirus to cause worst economic downturn since Great Depression, IMF forecasts","The coronavirus pandemic will push the global economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says.   IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the world's poorest countries would suffer the most if the COVID-19 fallout drove markets to their lowest levels since the 1930s. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" Ms Georgieva said, speaking ahead of next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. She said the IMF would release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that would show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak had turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn.    Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis.  Now the expectation is more than 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this year.    Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at high risk, she said.   ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Ms Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession.  As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries has totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the past two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Ms Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices.   Numbers released on Thursday by the US Government showed 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.  That amounts to about one in 10 American workers — the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since the world's largest economy began keeping records in 1948. And still more job cuts are expected.  The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent, a number not seen since the tail end of the Great Depression. Ms Georgieva said there was no question 2020 would be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF was forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said.  ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.""   She said she and World Bank president David Malpass would pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they could use for critical health needs. She also said the IMF was prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that needed help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board agreed to double the loan levels it would provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide about $US100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

2,/news/2020-04-09/coronvirus-early-release-superannuation-assistance-withdrawals/12137774?section=business,"More than 600,000 Australians apply for early release of superannuation under coronavirus assistance scheme","Nearly 618,000 Australians have applied to get an early release of their superannuation under the Federal Government's plan to help people out of work and facing financial hardship during the coronavirus pandemic.   From April 20, the Morrison Government is allowing retrenched workers and those suffering financial hardship because of shutdowns to access up to $20,000 in super and take it out tax free. The first $10,000 is available between mid-April and July 1, and the second $10,000 is available after July 1 for about three months. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said as of midnight April 8, it had 617,800 registrations of interest, but could not yet estimate how many people would be eligible to draw down.  This figure is up from more than 360,000 it reported as of last Friday, and Australians are yet to be able to fill out the official form which allows them to apply from April 20.   To be eligible, people must be either unemployed or eligible for welfare support payments including the JobSeeker payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Special Benefit or Farm Household Allowance. The scheme is also on offer to those who have had their working hours reduced by 20 per cent or more, or sole traders whose business has been suspended or seen turnover fall by at least 20 per cent. While the Federal Government has estimated that Australians facing hardship will be repaid about $27 billion tax free from their super savings, Rice Warner has estimated the figure could be as high as $50 billion. The Government has repeatedly warned superannuation funds — which reap more than $30 billion annually in fees in Australia's $3 trillion sector — to act responsibly during this crisis. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had said super fund trustees should have managed their legal obligations responsibly over the years to ensure that they have ""appropriate liquidity"". He warned that if they do not regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has a number of levers it can pull, including directing mergers in cases where a fund is unable to meet the needs of members.   There are longstanding clauses in superannuation fund product disclosure statements — which regularly get updated and have been recently revised for unique reasons unrelated to the government scheme — giving the funds discretion about whether to allow early withdrawals. The funds say these clauses are not new or exceptional, and that they plan to pay out their members.   But the fine print takes on a new meaning when hundreds of thousands of Australians are now applying for early withdrawals, and it remains to be seen if funds start exercising their discretion more aggressively. The $44 billion fund representing largely hospitality workers, Hostplus, said in a statement that it recently updated its product disclosure statement. This was to reflect a clause in Hostplus' trust deed that gives it ""a broad discretion to suspend or delay unit pricing in extraordinary situations to ensure equity, fairness and balance in investment pricing and transactions in the best interests of all members"". ""In Hostplus' case, this trustee power is not new,"" the statement said. ""It is not unique. It is not exceptional."" Hostplus' chief executive David Elia has publicly defended fund's liquidity position, recently bolstering its cash reserves to $6 billion. The fund's statement said it remained ""committed to supporting the Federal Government's policy to allow members to access up to a total of $20,000 from their superannuation accounts"" and that it had ""ample liquidity available to support members undergoing financial hardship"".   REST, the industry fund representing retail employees and managing about $60 billion in retirement savings, is also expected to see a flood of applications. It has a longstanding clause that states the trustee has discretion to pay out, but a spokesman said the fund had ""extensive liquid assets and is currently well placed to support the early release measures when they become available from April 20"". ""We are also stress testing our liquidity position regularly and are currently comfortable with our financial position to handle a variety of early release scenarios,"" he said. ""The regulations for the new early release measure require us to pay members as soon as practicable after we receive the ATO's determination,"" the REST spokesman added.   Unisuper the $85 billion fund representing university workers, updated its trust deed this week, but said that had nothing to do with the Government scheme. ""The update reflects the changes that were agreed in 2019 and have no impact to payments for members requesting early access to super,"" a spokeswoman told ABC News. ""We have no intention to suspend/restrict payments to eligible members requesting early access to super,"" she added. ""UniSuper has a very conservative approach to liquidity management and we're well positioned to handle the current situation as a result of the pandemic.""   MediaSuper represents those in media and entertainment industry and has more than $6 billion in funds under management. It told ABC News its clause regarding ""absolute discretion"" to impose conditions or restrictions on the amount of money members were able to withdraw was ""a standard provision"" that had been around for years. ""There were no limits or restrictions placed on withdrawals from or investment switches within Media Super during the global financial crisis, and we don't anticipate imposing any limits or restrictions during the current crisis,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Well-run funds are managed with key risks, including substantial market swings or increased switches or withdrawals, considered and factored into investment portfolio strategies and management.""   ""It is the ATO, not the fund, that determines the eligibility of applicants for early release of their super."" ""We will be processing applications as and when approved by the ATO and have more than adequate liquidity to cover the estimated level of applications."" Cbus, the fund representing the construction industry, noted that it had no clause that provided a broad discretionary power to freeze payments, but required members to prove eligibility for withdrawal to protect its members. A spokesman said the fund had ""paid close attention to the lessons of the GFC"". ""We have a very robust approach to liquidity and stress testing,"" the Cbus spokesman said. ""Cbus is in a strong position with liquidity and we believe we are able to pay all member hardship claims, even prior to the recent Jobseeker payment announcement.""   Alex Dunnin, director of financial services research firm Rainmaker, also argued the industry did not have a liquidity problem and said it was ""premature to speculate that some funds will get into trouble"". While it would ""have to wait and see how the rule changes impacts particular funds"", he said the industry had about $950 billion in cash and bonds — $397 billion cash and $549 billion in bonds.   And should it really run into trouble, the Future Fund was ""sitting on the sidelines with $37 billion in cash and bonds"". ""We also need to realise that it's not the capital market falls that are the issue because super funds appear to have withstood that onslaught reasonably, all things considered,"" Mr Dunnin said. ""It's the forced hibernation of particular industries and the Government changing the early release rules which … regulators had no warning of, much less super funds."" ""To say funds should have seen this coming is disingenuous."" The industry had a fantastic year in 2019, so the 12-month return was only down 3 per cent despite the recent bushfires and current coronavirus crisis. ""Funds have had a boom 10 years, so they're weathering the storm,"" he said. All funds would follow the law, he said, ""And if not, you have a regulator with a baseball bat"".   The real test for superfunds was whether funds could handle higher administration requirements as they were faced with a flood of enquiries. And another challenge would be how funds dealt with the change in priorities from long-term investment to short-term cash management. Super had now become a form of emergency cash management, and some funds were concerned there would be pressure from the Federal Government to change the way super funds operated in the future. ""They've now received a strong message that they must be prepared to play a fundamentally different role in the economy,"" Mr Dunnin said. The industry would have to hold more cash and liquid assets, which ""could have profound effects on future returns"". ""Funds are going to have to build reserves for this type of event,"" he said. The big increase in government debt also meant ""we might have to rethink the fundamental tax structure of the superannuation tax system"". ""Once again young people may get hit just as they're getting started,"" he said. ""We simply don't know how this will play out.""

3,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-virigin-australia-suspends-domestic-flights/12139020?section=business,Virgin Australia suspends domestic flights during coronavirus crisis,"Virgin Australia is suspending all its domestic flights except for a single Sydney to Melbourne return service, which will run once per day, except for Saturdays.   It is understood the suspension will start on Friday. The airline, which is seeking $1.4 billion in government assistance, says demand has dropped due to coronavirus travel restrictions. A spokesperson for Virgin Australia said the airline would continue to monitor passenger numbers and adjust capacity requirements as necessary.  ""As a result of government restrictions, less people are travelling and we have made changes to our schedules to reflect this,"" they said. ""We continue to operate a daily service between Melbourne and Sydney, provide cargo transport locally and overseas, and operate charter flights including assisting the Government in bringing Australians home.""   A notice on the company's website says:  ""If you a hold a ticket for travel up to June 30, 2020, you can change your booking or request a travel credit without a change or cancellation fee. Fare and tax differences may apply. ""Guests who have booked flights on a suspended service will be contacted via email, prioritised by departure date, with alternative travel options."" Virgin Australia would not confirm any additional job losses, after previously announcing 8,000 workers would be stood down.   Last month, Virgin Australia grounded its entire international fleet in response to COVID-19. The company had also already announced it would temporarily reduce chairman and director fees by 15 per cent, and remove bonuses. Some aviation experts warned the company may fail to survive the crisis despite Federal Government stimulus measures. ""This says to me that the major shareholders, which are foreign companies and own 90 per cent of Virgin, are clearly not prepared to put any more into it,"" said airline consultant Neil Hansford from Strategic Aviation Solutions. ""This is the only way it's got of preserving cash.""   Singapore Airlines, Etihad, Chinese groups Nanshan and HNA and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group all have stakes in Virgin Australia. ""They can't between them get enough shareholder contributions, which tells me they don't see a future for Virgin,"" Mr Hansford said.   While Qantas was able to raise $1.05 billion in additional funding by taking out a 10-year loan secured against its aircraft, Mr Hansford said Virgin did not have that option. He argued the Government was unlikely agree to a $1.4 billion bailout, considering 8,000 of Virgin's 10,000 workers have been stood down, leaving a vastly reduced workforce. In a statement released on Thursday, Transport Minister Michael McCormack said the Federal Government was taking every possible action to maintain a strong and competitive aviation sector after the coronavirus pandemic.  ""As Australia's aviation industry faces an unprecedented and sustained period of falling demand, we continue to work with all stakeholders, including the major airlines, to ensure we meet and beat the current challenges — together,"" the statement said. ""That's why we have already invested more than $1 billion to support our Australian aviation industry.""    The support includes a $715 million package waiving fuel excise and government charges backdated to February 1, 2020.  The Government also set aside $198 million to ensure the continued operation of essential flights into regional communities and $100 million to provide direct financial support to smaller regional airlines.  The fortnightly JobKeeper wage subsidy is also available to a range of eligible businesses across all sectors of the aviation industry.    ",,"April 09, 2020"
4,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-poverty-study-research-oxfam-anu/12136222?section=business,"Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty by coronavirus economic fallout, study finds","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy could see as many as 580 million people — 8 per cent of the world's population — pushed into poverty, according to researchers.   Aid groups, meanwhile, are calling on rich countries to cancel foreign debt held by developing nations in light of projections that decades of poverty alleviation efforts could be lost. A paper released by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research projects that if consumption contracts in developing countries by 20 per cent, it could see an increase in poverty for 400 to 600 million people globally. ""We were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow COVID-19 in developing countries,"" said Professor Andy Sumner, one of the lead authors from King's College London.   ""Our findings point towards the importance of a dramatic expansion of social safety nets in developing countries as soon as possible and — more broadly — much greater attention to the impact of COVID in developing countries and what the international community can do to help.""   ""Even under our most conservative scenario, too conservative to be realistic … we're still talking about 100 million extra people [falling] into extreme poverty,"" said Christopher Hoy of the Australian National University, another author of the report.   In the Middle East and North Africa, he said, it was ""very possible"" that poverty rates could return to what they were in 1990. The research was released as scientists said they were concerned a new wave of coronavirus would spread across Asia. Humanitarian workers have warned that the pandemic could prove devastating in much of Asia and the Pacific, due to widespread poverty, crowded living conditions and weak healthcare systems. CARE Australia fears a ""nightmare scenario"" if the disease takes hold in Papua New Guinea and Australia's other Pacific neighbours.   In Indonesia — the world's fourth most populous nation — projections have shown up to 240,000 people could die  if no control measures were taken. Mr Hoy warned ""the economic crisis was potentially going to be even more severe than the health crisis"". ""In Indonesia, for example, extreme poverty is quite low but a lot of people are just above the extreme poverty line,"" he told the ABC.    ""In our moderate scenario we'd expect to see a 50 per cent increase in the people living in extreme poverty. Under our extreme scenario it would more than double."" Lyn Morgain, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said that while a number of countries in South-East Asia had technically reached middle income status, it obscured the fact that development was uneven and that there continued to be ""profound and deep poverty in many of those nation states"".   Successive Australian governments have cut aid to South-East Asia and South Asia, in favour of funding programs in the Pacific.  Ms Morgain said that there was ""greater utility"" in a broader regional approach focused on Asia as well as the Pacific nations, especially during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not something we would regard as simply a favour to others. Our region has great strength and capability,"" she said. The ABC asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Australia's assistance to the region, but had not received a response at the time of publication.  Last month, the United Nations unveiled a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan and urged members of the G20, including Australia, to contribute to helping developing countries weather the economic storm caused by coronavirus. ""The only way for Australia to have a safe and prosperous future, is if Australia is in a safe and prosperous region,"" Mr Hoy said. The World Bank has predicted a global recession and estimated recently that nearly 24 million fewer people would escape poverty across the Asia Pacific in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic.  It called for ""urgent investment"" in healthcare systems and fiscal measures such as subsidising sick leave.   ""Countries in East Asia and the Pacific that were already coping with international trade tensions and the repercussions of the spread of COVID-19 in China are now faced with a global shock,"" said Victoria Kwakwa, the World Bank's vice president for East Asia and the Pacific.  ""The good news is that the region has strengths it can tap, but countries will have to act fast and at a scale not previously imagined."" Along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank recently called on creditors to allow poor countries to suspend debt payments during the crisis. But Ms Morgain said this did not go far enough, and called for debts to be cancelled altogether.   ""What is vitally important is that we take the big structural choices like forgiving debt to allow countries to make their own path to recovery,"" she told the ABC. ""On the global stage there is also an opportunity for Australia to take a leadership role, with an understanding that like people people, countries can't get back on their feet if they're struggling with unethical levels of debt."" Tonga and Samoa, for example, have high levels of debt distress, Mr Hoy said.  ""One thing that Australia could do is step up and assist with that debt cancellation,"" he said.  The World Bank and IMF will meet in Washington next week to discuss global economic priorities. Researchers hope that the stark poverty projections inform decisions during these forums. ""The work we have ahead of us is completely unimaginable,"" Ms Morgain said. ""We can step in now and make decisions at the global level … to make things for everyone so much better on the other side of this pandemic.""     ",By Max Walden,"April 10, 2020"
5,/news/2020-04-09/lonely-planet-to-cut-melbourne-office-as-coronavirus-hits-sales/12136662?section=business,Lonely Planet to close most of its Melbourne office as coronavirus impacts sales,"Travel publisher Lonely Planet has announced it will close most of its operations in Melbourne and London as the company deals with the impacts of coronavirus on its sales.   The company said it had made the ""difficult decision to reduce its publishing operations for the foreseeable future"". Lonely Planet said it would continue to publish guidebooks and phrasebooks. But it said it would not commission any new ""inspirational"" titles and would stop publishing the Lonely Planet magazine. ""Lonely Planet is currently proposing that its operations in London and Melbourne close almost entirely, with impacts in other Lonely Planet locations around the world,"" the company's communications manager Adam Bennett said. Lonely Planet was founded in 1973 when Australian couple Tony and Maureen Wheeler published their first guidebook, Across Asia on the Cheap. The company became a favourite of many travellers, with its guidebooks pored over in hostels and bars around the world. Mr Wheeler, who no longer has any official role with the company, told the ABC he was ""shocked"" by Lonely Planet's announcement. ""I was surprised and I continue to be surprised, I am waiting to hear more about it,"" he said. He said Lonely Planet had been a healthy business before coronavirus shut down the travel industry. Mr Wheeler said he thought much of the company's activity had still been occurring from the London and Melbourne offices, but said an office in Dublin had been growing. ""It always surprised me how big and busy the UK office was, that was becoming more the centre around the world where things were happening,"" he said. ""Although a lot was still happening in Melbourne as well.""   He said traditionally the company used its UK office to look after European publications, Australia was used to cover the Asia Pacific and an office in the US looked after the Americas. Mr Wheeler said he had heard from staff at Lonely Planet that there had been an increasing push towards using technology to update guidebooks in the past decade, and said the coronarvirus outbreak could prompt the company to accelerate that shift to cut costs. ""Much more they update things where the rewriting is effectively done by the computers,"" he said. ""They feed the prices in, the computer then says what rooms cost in that hotel or a meal at that restaurant, so there has been this increasing automation of the writing process if you like."" He said the coronavirus crisis meant many travel companies will essentially be start-up businesses when they can re-open, but he is hopeful domestic travel will be allowed again in the not-too-distant future. The coronavirus crisis is not the only challenge Lonely Planet has faced in recent years. Its ownership has changed hands twice, with the BBC's commercial arm buying a majority stake in 2007 from the Wheelers. A year later a former guidebook author revealed he had written for Lonely Planet about a country that he had not actually visited. BBC Worldwide later sold the company to NC2 Media — a company based in Nashville, Tennessee in the United States. It has had to cut staff previously as the company dealt with the transition to digital publishing. In 2013 it cut about 80 roles, with most of the job losses coming from the Melbourne office.",By Elise Kinsella,"April 09, 2020"

The television tradie's 15-month appointment to the role has been the subject of significant criticism after it was revealed he had only attended one public event and appeared in a handful of social media videos in his first few months as ambassador. Mr Cam hit out at questions about whether he was providing taxpayers with value for money, even telling one journalist his salary was ""none of your business"" in a live television interview. The coronavirus outbreak in Australia, and the associated social restrictions that have shut down workplaces and TAFE colleges, have now hampered his attempts to become more visible. ""The nature of the role of national careers ambassador has also changed with face-to-face events being cancelled,"" Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said in a statement. ""Mr Cam will continue to work with the Australian Government and the National Careers Institute to amplify online training opportunities and engage with Australians through digital mediums.

He has been paid $175,000 so far, meaning he is giving up the remaining $172,000.

7,/news/2020-04-09/online-gaming-hits-huge-numbers-during-coronavirus-pandemic/12135714?section=business,Online gaming is getting a big boost from the coronavirus pandemic — and experts say it's just the beginning,"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, most Australian parents would agree that online gaming was a lot more than just a growing trend.   Already a hundred-billion-dollar global industry, online gaming has become a popular pastime for many, and even a full-blown profession for some. Dedicated esports arenas, huge tournaments and the migration of traditional sport into the virtual world in recent years have proven it was already here to stay. But off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, the proliferation of online gaming in households is predicted to go to the next level. James Birt, Associate Professor in Information and Computing Science at Bond University, has studied emerging technology for the past 20 years and says he is seeing record-breaking levels of participation.   Some game manufacturers across the world have reported downloads have more than doubled, while a staggering 1.2 billion hours of content was consumed on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""The number of people playing games is off the charts, we have never seen this many players streaming and playing simultaneously online, in the history of gaming,"" Associate Professor Birt said. Earlier this week, Twitch reported it had more than 4 million concurrent viewers on its platform for the first time, after the release of Valorant, by Riot Games. ""I think what COVID-19 has really created is this point in time that one could say, is when this movement happened,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""Kids, esports enthusiasts, just [the] general public are getting into games in a way that they have never done in history. ""What we see now is those people that hadn't engaged in esports and gaming prior to the pandemic are now driving in droves towards new opportunities new experiences, new collaborative opportunities with friends.""     Motorsport is one of a number of Australian sports well placed during the downtime to take advantage of the booming interest and willingness of fans to watch online games. The inaugural All Stars Eseries event took place on Wednesday night and saw drivers competing remotely against each other online, in the first of 10 rounds. It was broadcast live on Fox Sports and streamed across multiple social platforms.   The competition followed the script from recent years in Supercars, with 2018 and 2019 series champion Scott McLaughlin winning two of the three races. The first two races featured the Phillip Island virtual circuit, while the final race was held using a digital version of the famous Monza track, home of the Italian Formula One grand prix. Like almost all of Australian sport, the traditional Supercars series — in which drivers and teams compete on tracks around the country — is on hold because of the pandemic. Instead, simulators have been installed in the homes of 25 drivers, who are getting used to the idea of getting suited up and racing the competition from the comfort of their own living space.   Holden driver Chaz Mostert has welcomed the initiative. ""Supercars has done all that it can to set this up so we can at least keep the fans entertained at home … I'm sure it's killing people like myself who wish we were racing, on the track, but we're making do with what we can at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a bit different, strolling down the stairs and going into the garage [to the simulator], it's a bit more unique than getting on a plane and going to a round!"" Similar moves are taking place in the United States, where NBA players have been pitted against each other in a special NBA 2K tournament, set to broadcast on ESPN. It is an example of how esports can also showcase sports stars in a unique way, by cutting to player reactions and banter over a mix of gameplay. Associate Professor Birt says many sports should be looking to take advantage of the unique opportunities that online gaming presents, given sports entertainment can now easily cross digital borders. ""The increase in the power behind the computing and the capacity to present the materials in 4K, we really are moving towards photo-realism in our games,"" he said. ""We are going to see even more dramatic increases this year with the release of things like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox [Series X],"" he said.   Mostert himself has been blown away by the quality of the visuals in his gaming experience, and said he was interested in being able to see the races on replay to get a different perspective from the simulator. ""I think we [drivers] are like fans, we're still going to be watching [the replay] tomorrow, even though the race happened today,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to having good on-track battles as well, it's still the same competition that we're used to out in the real world, and no doubt we'll still be racing for sheep stations in the virtual world as well."" With traditional sport still in a pandemic-induced hiatus, esports is expected to further develop its role in the Australian sporting landscape in the months ahead. ""I think there is this incredible blend between the technical capacity of esports to essentially get into people's living rooms,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""What television hasn't been able to do is create that connection between players, the games and the brands.""    ",By Patrick Galloway,"April 09, 2020"
8,/news/2020-04-09/inside-centrelink-coronavirus-debt-pause-is-causing-confusion/12133854?section=business,"Inside Centrelink, the coronavirus debt 'pause' is causing confusion","Centrelink debt recovery staff have been instructed to keep raising debts against people who have died and to undertake a range of debt recovery activities, leaked emails obtained by 7.30 have revealed.   On Friday evening, Government Services Minister Stuart Robert announced the Government was ""implementing a pause on debt raising and recovery activity through Services Australia to help ease pressure on people's budgets during the coronavirus pandemic"". He said the debt freeze would be in place for six months. But just hours earlier within the department a range of directives had been sent from senior departmental staff to debt recovery staff advising them that a number of debt recovery activities remained ""business as usual"".   Service Australia's national debt manager Anthony Seebach initially informed staff about the freeze on debt activities in an email on Friday morning, telling staff that some debt recovery teams would be reallocated to roles processing claims. But in a follow-up email later on Friday afternoon from national manager Pauline O'Neill, she advised debt recovery staff that: ""I just want to be clear that there are however a number of critical functions undertaken within the branch that will continue as usual.""   She went on to list ""case managed recovery"" as one function, and in a bullet point titled ""debt"" outlined that ""inbound telephony services (raising and recovery), SME [subject matter expert] reviews for appeals, deceased estate work"" would all continue for Service Australia staff. ""Deceased estate work"" refers to the raising and recovery of alleged debts from Centrelink customers who have died. That process previously came under scrutiny when 7.30 revealed Centrelink was raising automatic debts known as robodebts against deceased customers. Mr Robert referred to a written statement provided by Services Australia general manager Hank Jongen in response to 7.30's questions. Mr Jongen said in a statement: ""The pause applies to a broad range of debt raising and recovery activities including those connected to social security payments, Family Tax Benefit and Child Care Subsidy. ""As per the Minister's media release, work relating to fraud and serious non-compliance will continue in order to maintain the integrity of the welfare system. ""Activities that will cease include referrals to external collection agencies, as well as the garnisheeing of tax refunds. During the pause, we are not asking customers to commence repaying money they owe except where it relates to fraud or serious non-compliance."" He also said there would be some ""residual"" debt activities that would continue. ""For example, those that enable customers to receive the correct payment (compensation clearances), speak to a debt management officer to change their payment arrangements, enable executors to finalise deceased estates, and provide customers with refunds where Services Australia has over-recovered amounts."" In relation to the recovery of debts from deceased customers, the statement said: ""Continuing activities include enabling executors to finalise deceased estates and receive appropriate clearance documentation."" He said Services Australia was unable to provide a figure on how many debts had been paused.   Welfare groups have raised concerns about how the debt pause is being implemented.  Services Australia is requiring welfare recipients who have existing debts to contact them to discuss their repayment plans.   But there is significant demand on Centrelink's phone services at the moment, making it difficult for people who may be seeking to pause their debts. Katherine Boyle, the deputy chair of peak community legal body Economic Justice Australia and CEO of the Welfare Rights Centre, told 7.30 that Centrelink should be automatically pausing the recovery of all current debts. ""People have to contact Centrelink in order to pause their debt repayments, and if they don't contact Centrelink they will continue to have to repay their debts,"" she said. ""Now, no-one can get through to Centrelink at the moment. So how can they pause their debt repayments during this time?"" The Welfare Rights Centre is also launching an information campaign aimed at raising awareness about welfare rights and entitlements to make the public aware of the significant changes occurring in the welfare system. Mr Jongen said in a statement: ""Existing repayment arrangements will also continue unless people contact Services Australia. This is consistent with the approach taken during disaster events, and allows people who want to keep paying down their debt to do so.""   There are also some concerns that the department's automated systems may still be sending out debt notices to some welfare recipients. Jae Evergreen is a disability support pensioner recipient who works part time for a not-for-profit disability advocacy group. Last week he attempted to declare his usual part-time working hours to Centrelink, but received error messages using the online logging system. He called a Centrelink officer to explain the situation and was assured he had taken all the correct steps to try to report his income.   On Monday this week, four days after the Government's announcement, he received a text message advising him he had a new myGov message. When he opened his inbox, he discovered a debt notice for $738 which he says was raised in the period he was unable to report his income. The letter was dated to Thursday April 2, but was only sent to him on Monday. ""I was quite distressed and when I'm distressed, being autistic, my body reacts in different ways. So I started shaking and I started crying,"" he said. He made multiple attempts to call Centrelink's disability contact line but said he was unable to even get through for at least three hours. He then called Centrelink's complaints line to explain the situation. He said that while the staff he spoke with were all very understanding, there seemed to be confusion over how the debt pause would work. ""This has been a theme across the board with my interactions with them over the last week. None of the staff at Centrelink know what's happening,"" he said. Mr Jongen's statement said: ""We are working hard to implement the pause on debt raising and recovery as announced by the Minister on Friday April 3. ""The debt raised in this case occurred on 2 April, prior to the Minister's announcement, and is now subject to the national pause.""   The coronavirus epidemic will place Australia's welfare agency under unprecedented strain.  It is currently redeploying hundreds of staff to assist in claims processing, and is hiring a large number of new staff.   Some Centrelink staff have also told 7.30 they have concerns over directives to work from their offices. In an email sent to all staff on Tuesday March 31, they were told: ""We are continuing to review our capacity to enable working from home, however our operational requirements mean that for most staff we need you to continue to come to the office at this time."" Staff who were considered to be at higher risk were advised they could discuss working from home or moving to another role. Centrelink also appears to be increasing its telephone operation systems in centralised buildings. A large number of Department of Social Services staff were advised in an email last week to vacate their offices. They were told ""later this week we will be converting the majority of the Enid Lyons building into a Services Australia call and processing centre"". ""It is important that you take your personal belongings home, and completely clear your desk, because it will be used by others undertaking this important work.""   Mr Jongen told 7.30 in a statement: ""In response to unprecedented demand, Services Australia has continued to bolster capacity to help more Australians access government support payments. ""There are now more than 6,200 additional staff allocated to call centres and processing, with plans for further staff to be on-boarded soon. These staff will be a mix of current Services Australia employees, broader APS staff joining the agency and newly hired staff ""The wellbeing of our staff and customers is always our top priority. We're working hard to balance the needs of our staff while delivering critical payments to the millions of Australians relying on us."" A spokesman for Mr Robert told 7.30: ""For many thousands of Australians, they've never in their life sought assistance from the Government before, so it will be a very new experience for them. ""As a consequence, we've seen unprecedented demand across all Centrelink call centres, shopfronts and myGov, but Services Australia is working to help everybody as quickly as possible.""

9,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-claiming-tax-rent-mortgage/12135048,Coronavirus is changing how we claim tax this year. But what about rent or mortgage?,"If your office is now at home, you may be wondering: does this mean I can claim my rent or mortgage at tax time? In an effort to get you through uncharted waters, we recently published this piece on what you can claim when working from home. With many of us now sharing our work space with our kids, our cats and our dirty dishes, the ATO has introduced a new, simpler method for people to make claims at tax time. It's an 80-cents-per-hour method, which includes all running expenses like the phone, power bills, heating and cooling. But many of you sent through some questions about particular household items. You were worried that if you claimed any home office expenses now that you might have to pay more tax when it comes time to sell your property. So we went back to our experts to find out.   So now that your work space and living space has combined, can you also claim your rent or the interest on your mortgage? Well, it's complicated. But in general, no.   That's because in most cases, your house isn't the main office, studio or place of business, says Andrew Gardiner, spokesperson for the National Tax and Accountants' Association. ""This is the case even though you might be highly encouraged or forced to work from home when dealing with the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. The main exception is if you legitimately run your small business from a dedicated space in your home or your employer does not provide you with an office or work station at their business premises. ""The classic example would be someone who runs a hairdressing salon out of part of their house and they have it dedicated for that purpose,"" Mr Gardiner said. But even then, you can't claim your total rent or the full amount of your interest on your mortgage. You can still only claim a portion, worked out by calculating the floor area of the business space compared to the total property size. Many people sent questions into us, worried that if they made any home office claims, they might get a sting in the tail when it comes time to sell their home — meaning they might have to pay capital gains tax.   Capital gains tax is basically a tax that you pay to the Government when you make a profit on an investment — usually a property or shares. You don't usually have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the home that you live in — it's called the main residence exemption. Fortunately, even if you make claims for home office expenses like the internet, phone, heating and cooling, you won't have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the family home, tax accountant Paula Hart says. ""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat. But, of course, if you're still confused, make sure you check with your accountant.     This article contains general information only. It should not be relied on as financial advice.

11,/news/2020-04-09/amid-coronavirus-slowdown-businesses-welcome-easter-trade-boost/12134546,"Amid coronavirus slowdown, Easter brings an economic boost for WA chocolatiers and fishmongers","For Perth chocolatier Sue Lewis, the demand for Easter chocolate has thown her microbusiness a financial lifeline amid the coronavirus economic crisis.   Easter is typically her busiest period and is what sustains the business for the year, but as coronavirus takes an economic toll on businesses everywhere, this year's Easter trade has become even more vital. ""If this had happened outside Easter, during the winter, I think we would have definitely struggled,"" Ms Lewis said. With only two customers allowed in the store at a time because of physical distancing restrictions, staying afloat has meant adapting and Ms Lewis's bustling shopfront has become an online delivery service.   ""It's been very busy. We were slightly concerned as it's our busiest time of year and this is the first time we've really sold online, but it's gone gangbusters,"" she said. In a small basement kitchen in the State Buildings, Ms Lewis has been working overtime to make sure there is enough chocolate for the Easter bunny to deliver. And she said she was deeply grateful that Premier Mark McGowan's Easter Bunny ""egg-semption"" had allowed her to do just that.   But beyond Easter, the future looks uncertain and Ms Lewis said the shop was looking at ways it could stay viable. ""We'll maybe do some online classes and also take a little bit of time out just to work on new products,"" she said.     Seafood sellers also depend heavily on Easter, when many people choose to buy fish for Good Friday. West Coast Seafood owner Winton Lawton said his delivery service was typically not as busy as other seafood retailers during Easter. But this week had been the busiest in 15 years, particularly throughout the central Wheatbelt and South West regions.   ""It's a bit like Christmas [but] without the organisation and planning because it's not something that we expected,"" he said. Mr Lawson said in the past week they had delivered more than 1,000 orders — double what the business usually does. He suspected that was because coronavirus restrictions had forced people to stay home and cook, rather than eat out. At Sealanes Seafood Market in South Fremantle, early Easter sales were busy too, but operations are very different. Typically, on the Thursday before Easter, about 100 people at a time would pile into the store.   This year Sealanes has implemented strict physical distancing restrictions and limited the number of customers in the store to 30. Retail supervisor Ben Fairchild said sales in recent weeks had been strong, due to customers buying early or stockpiling. But he said buying patterns had changed — customers were purchasing smaller fillets rather than one big fish, which he said indicated people were adhering to advice and cancelling large family gatherings.     Many West Australians have had to cancel their traditional Easter long weekend getaways, with checkpoints in place to stop people travelling outside of their region for anything other than essential travel. And while long weekend double demerits still apply to anyone caught committing traffic offences, the Government is hoping that with far fewer drivers on the roads, there will be a significant drop in deaths and serious injuries, particularly on regional roads.

12,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-cash-crisis-savings-dry-up-support-weeks-away/12133294,Jobseekers facing coronavirus cash crisis as savings dry up weeks before support will arrive,"Student nurse Keith Dwyer is heading into the coronavirus trenches, ending his studies early to be rocketed to the frontline of the pandemic — except he can't fill up the tank of his car to get to his final classes.   ""I essentially have no more savings because I've used the last of it to pay my last lot of rent,"" he said. ""As soon as the gas runs out of my car … I'm pretty much done."" Mr Dwyer, who lost his casual job at a cafe, is emblematic of the cash crisis facing Australians, who have high levels of household debt and only a small cushion of savings. Half of the Australian population has less than $10,000 in savings, and that's looking at the data generously.   Go deeper and you'll find a third of Australians have less than $5,000 stashed away for emergencies such as this. One quarter of the population have less than $1,000 in the bank.   Expenses vary between individuals and between different places across the country — for example, people in major cities tend to have higher housing costs, but some rural and remote locations pay more for groceries and essential services. However, low-ball estimates suggest an average single person needs $2,835 a month for expenses and a couple needs $4,118, not including rent or mortgage payments. A family of four will have estimated expenses of $5,378 a month.   As the coronavirus crisis has escalated and public health measures have been increased, jobs have been lost and incomes have been slashed, leading to more people running out of savings. On March 13, the Formula 1 Australian Grand Prix, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and a swathe of other public events were called off. Within a week, social distancing guidelines essentially killed off restaurants, cafes and bars. Days later, a ban on non-essential services went further and some of the largest retail chains in Australia closed their doors, leaving more than a million people unemployed. Critically, support for most workers isn't expected to flow until almost three weeks from now, to give the Australian Tax Office time to change their systems and deliver the new payments. The increased JobSeeker unemployment payment will be paid from April 27, while businesses who have kept workers on under the JobKeeper arrangement will receive money from May 1. ""I don't think people understand how hospitality workers in particular live pay cheque to pay cheque, because we don't make a whole lot of money and Melbourne isn't a cheap place to live,"" Mr Dwyer said. ""It's not feasible to think that I could have three months of savings in the bank when I work what is considered an unskilled non-essential job that's been casualised for years."" Emma King, the chief executive of the Victorian Council of Social Service, the peak body for the state's social and community sector, said people thrown into unemployment needed support now. ""The sheer desperation of people who are lining up at Centrelink at 4:30 in the morning, simply to get seen, speaks to the fact of people's fear, their anxiety and the sense of urgency of not having enough money to make ends meet,"" she said.   The rebranded Newstart unemployment payment, JobSeeker, is available to some and a $750 stimulus payment went out on March 31 to people already receiving benefits including an age pension, disability support pension, carer payment, Austudy or veteran service pension.  A second payment will go out in July. But for most people, many of them interacting with the welfare system for the first time, there's nothing coming for many weeks. ""There is simply no reason why that date can't be brought forward. The money needs to flow from the time that people need it,"" Ms King said. ""We know that most people do not have a cushion of savings to get them through hard times. ""For many people it's simply a matter of, if you lose your job, if you have a health issue, can you pay the mortgage or can you not? Can you afford to pay the electricity bill or can you not?"" Casual workers, gig economy workers, internationals students and people on working visas are among the groups who may fall through the cracks of the new schemes. The $130 billion program is eye-watering in its size but has been criticised for leaving out large groups of workers, many of them already vulnerable. This week Attorney-General Christian Porter defended the arrangements. ""Even with expenditure of this extraordinary size, there have to be some definitions and some lines drawn… we think this is a fair and reasonable line,"" he said. Mr Dwyer had been casually employed at a coffee shop at Melbourne's Monash University for six years, working long hours around hospital training placements across the state. But when foot traffic dwindled because of work from home directives and travel bans for students, the cafe closed and the 26-year-old's much-loved job was gone.   ""It all happened on one day, they ran the numbers after work on a Monday and I was the first person my boss called, because I'd been there the longest,"" he said. ""I think he wanted to ease into it, because he had to call 10 people and tell them that no-one had a job."" The cafe has so far decided not to reopen and rehire him under the JobKeeper program. Mr Dwyer lives frugally and hasn't had a holiday in seven years. He's got some food in the pantry but has started up an online fundraiser to get money for the petrol he needs to attend his final nursing classes. ""If we can't work and the money stops coming in, the expenses don't stop coming."" Despite not getting to finish his studies, he's ready to confront the reality of the looming coronavirus health crisis. ""Realistically, we need as many people as we can. As many hands on deck as possible to help prepare to help manage and to help recover,"" he said. But right now, he's the one asking for help, as he says April 27 is too long to wait. ""We are genuinely hard workers,"" he said, referring to casual workers. ""We're not asking for handouts, we'd love to work, but right now we're exhausted, we're supporting vulnerable friends and vulnerable families… we'd just like a little bit of support from our government to put food on the table and to let us help out for a while.""

13,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-economy-printing-money-quantitative-easing/12134560,Coronavirus chaos has hit the economy and the RBA's approach to money printing is supposed to save it,"Earlier this week I wrote about the Reserve Bank's decision to start printing money. Yes, Australia's central bank is now plugging in extra digits on its computer trading screens to artificially pump up how much cash it has on its balance sheet. It's creating money out of thin air. It doesn't need to print the money via the Mint. It's doing this so it can dive into the bond market and buy up as many government bonds as it so chooses. The idea being that the more bonds it buys up, the lower interest rates go, and the easier it is for people to repay their mortgages, for businesses to pay off their loans and for the government to afford its JobKeeper payments. Once the piece was published though, I received a flood of emails, texts and calls with follow-up questions. Why? Well because this is stuff is not easy to wrap your head around. I mean what are bonds in the first place, who owns what? Why can't the Reserve Bank just write off the debt? So, here are some answers to the most common questions.   They are IOUs. If you earn money, you have the capacity to borrow money and pay it back at some point, with interest. The government can borrow huge amounts of money because it has a big capacity to pay it back — because it's got millions of taxpayers giving it money every day. So, it issues its own bonds (with a world-class credit rating attached).   Theoretically there are no limits to how much the RBA can increase the size of its cash reserves by creating money our of thin air (or the tap of a keyboard). The Reserve Bank will create as much money as it believes is necessary to stabilise the monetary system and to ensure the government, households and businesses can borrow with relative ease.   To ensure the credibility of the RBA itself though, and the integrity of the monetary system as a whole, the Reserve Bank will only print money, and buy bonds, to assist with sound economic policy. Even in its latest monetary policy statement it made it clear the bank was already working on a money printing exit strategy. ""Bank has bought around $36 billion of government bonds in secondary markets, including bonds issued by the states and territories,"" RBA governor Philip Lowe noted. ""The Bank will continue to promote the smooth functioning of these important markets. ""If conditions continue to improve, though, it is likely that smaller and less frequent purchases of government bonds will be required.""   There are no hard and fast rules around how long quantitative easing or money printing should last. In the United States it lasted years during and after the global financial crisis. In Japan, it lasted over a decade. ""It could go on indefinitely,"" AMP Capital's Head of Investment Strategy Shane Oliver told the ABC. Hyperinflation is when prices for everyday items spiral out of control. It's been known to happen when money printing is involved.   Economists say it's unlikely to happen this time around, in Australia, because inflation was already very low to begin with. ""The downside [to QE] is that it could cause inflation,"" AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver says. ""It's made possible now because inflation is low."" In addition to this, the global financial crisis left the global economy with a legacy of relatively high underemployment, the gig economy, and very weak wage growth. ""GFC left a lot of spare capacity in labour markets,"" Dr Oliver says. So basically all of this points to the fact that, in this economic climate, strong inflation is hard to come by, so even a $36 billion money printing program by the RBA is unlikely to change that.   This is a hugely important question, and the answer is yes. First let's look at why the RBA is not buying bonds directly from the government. By far and away the most frequently asked question was, ""why can't the Reserve Bank just buy the bonds directly from the government?"" If the Reserve Bank did this it would be directly providing the government with money it's plucked out of thin air, which the government can then spend or give to households. The famous economist Milton Friedman came up with this idea in 1969. To illustrate it he described a helicopter dropping money into people's backyards. But the RBA and government are doing this! I hear you say. Well, sort of.   The government issues bonds, banks buy those bond and the Reserve Bank then buys those same bonds off the bank. So, for practical purposes, the RBA now owns those bonds and will receive coupon payments from the government … and you could draw a line from the RBA to the government in terms of money flows. The government then uses that money to pay for JobKeeper payments and the like — money directly into workers' pockets. That sounds an awful lot like helicopter money. However, by putting the private sector between the government and the Reserve Bank, you create a crucial buffer. It means the Reserve Bank can't simply write off the debt (which would compromise the integrity of the entire monetary system). It's not even tempted to do that. In addition, by ensuring the bonds make it into the private financial markets, the Reserve Bank can influence interest rates across the board (because changes in the three-year bond yield have a knack of influencing other interest rates). Leading economists conceded it's helicopter money by a different name. ""It is a technicality,"" concedes Dr Oliver. ""It's a fine line."" EY Oceania's chief economist Jo masters agrees. ""It is quite a fine line. If you get a central bank buying bonds directly from the government, you blur the lines of [independence]."" By having the Reserve Bank buy bonds in the secondary market, ""it adds another step in the process that keeps the elected government focused on fiscal policy,"" Ms Masters argues. Take heart, this is a mathematical description of one aspect of how a central bank buying bonds helps the economy. I've no idea what it means.      ",By David Taylor,"April 09, 2020"

For the owner of Lavandula Swiss Italian Farm in Daylesford, Carol White, now would usually be one of her busiest periods, but due to coronavirus the cash flow has dried up. ""We dramatically closed on the 16th of March when a staff member's wife, who works in the hospital, was quarantined with suspected COVID-19,"" she said. ""This person had been in touch with everybody so it meant everybody had to go home and we had to stop tourists coming on site. ""People had to abandon ship, basically."" Ms White has run the lavender farm for 30 years where she sells therapeutic skincare products and homewares.   Businesses like Lavandula are struggling to work out where they fit in the landscape of support payments — being neither exclusively agriculture or tourism — making it hard to work out where to turn for help. ""We have no income basically because we relied on the farm gate sales,"" she said. ""I'm really wondering how much business we're going to have at the end of six months. How do you restart?"" The Easter holidays are usually one of the farm's busiest times, and Ms White said the halt on tourism will damage the business' bottom line. ""On some days we'd have 200 people come through the gates,"" she said.   ""We're now missing our peak time, which is our winter money."" In addition to the lack of foot traffic, Ms White is worried about how the business will pay for supplies that are likely to go to waste. ""There's thousands of dollars' worth of stock that we've bought — prime goods, things to make scones or jams with, that will just never be used,"" she said. ""It's just sitting there looking at me. So it's a bit depressing and daunting to think 'no income, how do we pay for this?'""   Farm maintenance happens over the slower winter period which is paid for by the usually busy Autumn season. But as Ms White waits in the uncertainty, she must keep working to make up ground for the loss of staff. ""I go to the farm every day and I'm picking up where we left off,"" she said. Lavandula employs approximately ten people in the busy season and Ms White is trying to retain their jobs while balancing the books. ""I haven't been able to keep my staff on until I know exactly what's happening with the JobKeepers subsidy and how that will work, who it will apply to,"" she said. ""A lot of our workers are seasonal and some of them are part-time, some are full-time. ""Certainly, we can keep our farm hands on, but the shopkeeper and the person who made the lavender scones, are they entitled to JobKeeper? We're not sure.""   As the business has missed out on vital profits this season, Ms White is already running at a loss and can not gamble with staff wages. ""It's so unclear what's going to happen that we can't just start borrowing money to pay wages in the hope that we get it right,"" she said. ""The staff are clambering to know what's happening. We're just sitting and waiting too."" ""As the week goes by a lot of wages means a lot of debt for us."" Ms White predicts people will be more conservative with their spending in coming years as thousands of people rely on welfare after losing jobs or coping with heavily reduced hours.   She said boutique products such as hers were unlikely to be sought after as people attempt to rebuild their lives. ""I can't really imagine how the general public will be in six months' time, half of them on JobKeeper allowances,"" she said. ""They'll barely be able to pay their mortgages and their cost of living. They're not going to jump back into having a nice weekend out in Daylesford.   ""I'm not sure if business will be as it were before, I'm pretty sure it won't be."" But Ms White knows she is not the only producer doing it tough as the tourism industry anxiously lingers. ""Everyone who's in this business, small boutique farming, the market is gone,"" she said. ""We're all so numb and shocked at the moment. ""If we get through this we get through it with our health and families. That's the greatest treasure, and the money will come again.""

Every day you're frightened, every day you're scared, basically. You get up and you leave your house, wondering what are you going to take home. My name is Marianna Donnelly. I'm nearly 55 years old. I've worked for Richie's Super IGA for 18 years. I love it. I get to work probably about half an hour to an hour early every morning in the dark. The first thing I do is get a bucket of hot soapy water and I go along and I clean everything that you would touch in a normal day. We clean everything, sanitise everything - ready for opening at 7:00. The majority of the customers during the panic buying were horrible because they just want, want, want, want, want. It has eased off now. You see a kindness now. (To customer) We are pretty lucky we're even open. Yeah, you're right there! A lady said to me yesterday, ""I can't believe you have got no sanitising wipes on the shelf"" and I said, ""Well, I can't help that.""  She went really mad at me. She goes, ""How do you think we feel?"" And I said, ""How do you think I feel when you walk in the store. I'm feeling what you're feeling, I'm no different"". I cried all way home one day. I remember that and I thought snap out of this Marianna, you're a bit tougher than that.  People are just scared. They are scared they are not going to be able to buy it again. See you tomorrow! I used to go home from work and I used to just probably get dinner ready then I would go and do yoga class because everyone knows I love my Bikram yoga. That's gone now so that was my de-stressing, my relaxation.So now, I am probably here longer. You just sort of get in the car; it is a relief going home. Another day's over. What's tomorrow going to bring? Hey! How are you? DAUGHTER:  Good. How was your day? MARIANNA DONNELLY:  Pretty good. When I get home, though, (Laughs) I have a Glen 20 and sanitiser at the front door. I take my vest off and give that a spray, take my shoes off, give them a spray. Then I just go, have a shower, put on fresh clothes, throw my clothes in the wash.  It is probably still on me somewhere. If it is or is it, you don't know. You don't know whether it's in your hair, on your skin. It is just, we all probably feel the same.  In the sun? DAUGHTER:  We will sit in the sun. MARIANNA DONNELLY:  Oh, that is nice. Some days you feel like pulling your hair out. You feel like crying but at the moment I'm proud of it. I think anyone who works for a supermarket at the moment should be proud of it. I love my job. I do love my job, I always have. I don't know. I'm just, yeah. I'm proud of what I do.",,"April 10, 2020"

      Duration: 4min 19sec Transcript ALAN KOHLER, REPORTER:  One of the things that's been really scaring us about this pandemic is what's happening to our retirement savings. So far the Australian pool of superannuation has fallen at least 13 per cent or $350 billion or so and that's because the global stock market has fallen 23 per cent and that's where about 55 per cent of the $2.7 trillion in super has been invested. Whether it recovers from here or goes down some more, nobody knows for sure but the risks, as they say, are skewed to the downside. Now first, that total pool number of $2.3 trillion now, down from about $2.7 trillion a couple of months ago, is pretty much irrelevant. It is made up of 15 million individual accounts and every one of them is different. Now you don't care about the pool, you care about your savings.  Some people choose the growth option, which has more money in shares and some are more conservative and some people have a self-managed fund, which could be entirely in shares. And each of these differences not only affects how they experience this downturn, but how the coronavirus will affect their lifestyle in retirement. ALEX DUNNIN, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, RAINMAKER GROUP:  The more equities, the more shares and property in your portfolio, the more you're probably going to feel the downturn, but it also means that over the last few years you have probably made a lot more money out of those investment options over the, the last decade has just been a boomer for superannuation funds and the last calendar year was like one of the best years on record. ALAN KOHLER:  The other important individual difference is age. Someone in their 20s has about 40 years of superannuation savings in front of them - so time is on their side. But someone else set to retire this year or next is going to get less than they bargained for. Now that has a name - it is called sequencing risk and with interest rates so low, that is serious.  If you were sitting on a super balance of, say, $700,000, that's already around $600,000 and your income on that has gone from $21,000 a year to around $18,000. Thank goodness for the safety net of the aged pension. Also, the Government has potentially made matters worse by letting people take up to $20,000 out of their super over two years if they are short of cash to live on. According to the Tax Office, 361,000 people have put in an expression of interest to get the first $10,000 out. Not only has everyone's balance reset lower because of the drop in the share market, those who, in some desperation, pull $10,000 or $20,000 out now are costing themselves 10 times that in retirement. ALEX DUNNIN:  No-one is denying the right of people to access superannuation if they really, really need the money but the common message from almost everybody is please don't take that money unless you really need it, because through the power of compound interest, taking out $10,000 or $20,000, say, when you're 25 or 30 years old could cost you $80,000 to $100,000 in lower retirement benefits by the time you actually leave the workforce. ALAN KOHLER:  Now, why do I say the share market and, therefore, super balances might fall some more? Well, it is just arithmetic. Here is a chart of the way shares are usually valued as a multiple of the profits that the companies make. Now usually they are priced around 14 times next year's expected profit. It got down to 12 times a couple of weeks ago, but now it is back up again. During the GFC in 2008 it got down to eight times because prices fell by more than half. The International Monetary Fund says things are now worse than they were then. KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA, IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR (April 3, Geneva):  We have witnessed the world economy coming to a standstill. We are now in recession. It is way worse than the global financial crisis. ALAN KOHLER:  But this time is different for two reasons. First, interest rates are much lower now, virtually zero versus 4 per cent. And second, there is much more fiscal stimulus this time around - more than twice. The Government giving us money, I mean. So maybe the impact on superannuation won't be way worse than the GFC. We can only hope.",Alan Kohler,"April 10, 2020"

20,/news/2020-04-06/is-capitalism-dying-or-just-in-isolation-coronavirus/12123874,Is capitalism dying or just in isolation during the coronavirus pandemic?,"Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was one of the first to cross the line. After reports began circulating that organised bands of hoarders, possibly even crime syndicates, were plundering regional supermarkets in search of toilet paper and other essentials, he took to the radio waves. ""We do have some people I think that are profiteering,"" he told 2GB's Ray Hadley a fortnight ago, during one of his regular spots.  He went on: ""They're hoarding, not for their own consumption, I think they're either sending some of the products overseas or they're selling it in a black market arrangement in Australia.""   For many, his comments made perfect sense. In a time of crisis, as vast numbers of Australians faced unemployment and businesses large and small across the globe faced either drastically reduced revenue or total shutdown, the idea of profiteering from human misery seemed abhorrent. There's just one problem. Our entire system of economic production and social organisation is structured around profiteering.   Seeking out gaps in the market and exploiting price anomalies are the everyday activities of anyone involved in any kind of trade, from shopkeepers and grocery wholesalers to money market high-flyers who trade synthetic derivatives of complex financial instruments. As a free-market economy, successive governments of all persuasions for the past half-century have embraced the idea that government should not run commercial enterprise. They've preached privatisation, asset recycling and the fundamental belief that free trade and minimal government intervention will maximise wealth and lift society as a whole. We've celebrated Australians who've taken on the world and won, who've played hard ball with the best of them and come out on top.   But it is a philosophy now being questioned, and not just here. For while the theory of free trade, and the mathematical formulae that underpin it, still hold true, many economists over the years jettisoned an equally important concept on the other side of the ledger. They forgot about distribution. They stopped thinking about how the spoils are divided. They looked on without a care as the wealthy became insanely rich while working class living standards across the developed world declined. In the space of a few months, as a health pandemic has gripped the world, all our preconceived notions of economic management are being questioned. Community suddenly has replaced competition as our primary motivating force.   It wasn't just toilet paper occupying the thoughts of senior Government ministers. A week after Mr Dutton's outburst, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced stricter rules would be placed around foreign investment in a bid to stop cashed-up corporations, particularly foreign-government-owned corporations, from snapping up local businesses and assets at fire-sale prices. It was an extraordinary step for a Government that has prided itself on its free trade credentials and its dizzying array of free trade agreements in recent years. ""This is a precautionary measure, this is a temporary measure, this reflects the extraordinary times that we're in, and obviously it's going to give the Government greater visibility and scrutiny of foreign investment proposals to ensure that they remain in the national interest,"" he told the ABC's Michael Rowland.  This, clearly, was a swipe at China, despite all the official denials.  While America may be our biggest foreign investor, much of that is financial investment and capital exchange. China, meanwhile, has been one of our fastest growing investors in real estate and businesses ranging from rural to resources.   China also just happens to be our biggest trading partner. It consumes vast quantities of our mining output, sends its students here to be educated and provides us with an incredible array of manufactured goods. The clampdown may enrage Beijing, but it is in character with a growing discontent across the globe.  The UK's vote to exit the European Union, Donald Trump's ascendancy to the US presidency and his appeal to the unemployed voters in what was once America's industrial heartland, are part of the backlash to globalisation, signalling an end to the era of laissez-faire economics. The Morrison Government, in the space of a few weeks, has thrown a large part of its ideology out the window.   It's been forced to recognise that survival is more important than surpluses, that markets don't always operate efficiently and in the best interests of society and that, occasionally, government intervention in the economy on a grand scale is vital. The speed at which this transformation has taken place is nothing short of breathtaking, and for many — including business and workers — entirely welcome. This time last year, the Coalition labelled the Opposition's election campaign pitch to lower the cost of childcare while increasing childcare workers' wages as ""communism"" and ""economic vandalism"". Last week, it offered free childcare to anyone who wanted it. For years, it has steadfastly refused to increase unemployment benefits. One of the first actions it took, as the health crisis unfolded, was to almost double the benefit. At this stage, however, it is temporary.   Sometimes, wisdom emanates from the most unlikely of places. For several years now, Macquarie Group managing director and the group head of Asia Pacific, Viktor Shvets, has been warning clients that conventional capitalism is dead and that it will be replaced by some form of communism. Viktor has never been one for niceties. Back in the 1980s, the then-stockbroking analyst ran the numbers on one of the nation's entrepreneurial powerhouses, the Adsteam group run by John Spalvins. He concluded it was a debt-laden house of cards that would collapse at the first hint of trouble. For an industry that was all about selling stocks and prided itself on sycophancy, Viktor's no-holds-barred approach to research left his contemporaries reeling and his superiors scrambling. Adsteam, by the way, which then owned David Jones and Petersville Sleigh, did indeed collapse, shortly after the 1987 share market crash. Viktor was right.   His argument now is compelling. Financial market liberalisation has seen debt levels explode, at a national, corporate and personal level. Central banks have injected so much cash into the global financial system, in an effort to keep it afloat, that traditional business cycles have halted. Past excesses, rather than being cleared, merely have been added to. And all the while, wealth has become ever more concentrated at the top. The dotcom crash was solved by adding ever more debt. So too was the global financial crisis. Now we have the COVID-19 health crisis that has shut down the global economy.   According to Mr Shvets, there are only three possible outcomes. One is that central banks win; that an economic recovery allows them to withdraw their stimulus without collapsing asset prices like stocks and housing. Not much chance of that, he reckons. The second is that governments take over, pick up the slack in jobs and cooperate with each other to solve global poverty and inequality. Slim chance. The third is war. This, he argues, is the most likely and the least pleasant outcome. Let's hope this time he's wrong.  ",By business editor Ian Verrender,"April 06, 2020"
21,/news/2020-04-05/coronavirus-exponential-growth-explained-by-rice-on-a-chessboard/12122214,The exponential growth of coronavirus can be explained by rice on a chessboard. And we should be worried,"There's a reason Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia's households may have to self-isolate for another six months. It's the maths. There's a mathematical law driving the growth in the number of coronavirus cases globally, which makes health experts so fearful. Frustratingly, some of Australia's highest-paid commentators can't wrap their heads around it, which is why they're telling their listeners and readers the Government is overreacting by shuttering parts of the economy and enforcing strict social distancing measures for the winter. The human brain wasn't built to think naturally about complicated mathematical phenomena. It's fine with basic maths, like simple percentages.   After a certain level of education, the brain intuitively understands that if you put $100 in a savings account with a 1 per cent interest rate, you'll have $101 after a specific period. But the brain can turn to mush when faced with more complicated problems, if it hasn't been taught how to think them through.   A famous example is the rice and chessboard problem. If someone gave you a chessboard (which has 64 squares on it) and asked you to put one grain of rice on the first square, two grains of rice on the second square, four grains of rice on the third, eight grains on the fourth, and so on, how many grains of rice would end up on the 64th square? It sounds like an easy question — it's simply asking you to double the number of rice grains from one square to the next, from 1 grain to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 to 32 to 64, and so on, until the 64th square.   What's the answer? You'd need 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains of rice for the 64th square. That's nine quintillion, two hundred and twenty-three quadrillion, three hundred and seventy-two trillion, thirty-six billion, etc, grains. And the amount of rice you'd need to cover the entire board — from squares 1 to 64 — would be 18.4 quintillion grains. That's 923 times the entire estimated global production of rice this financial year. The educational joy of that problem comes from the lesson that when something tiny begins multiplying at a constant rate it can become mindbogglingly large within a surprisingly short amount of time. It also reveals how the human brain struggles with the concept of exponential growth — it can't fathom how something growing slowly can suddenly explode in size. That's the phenomenon driving the growth in the number of coronavirus cases globally, which is why the virus is so dangerous.   It's also why people can look foolish when they complain that authorities in Australia are overreacting. The total number of new cases of the virus is currently doubling every six to seven days in Australia. It's encouraging news, because last month the number of new cases was doubling every three to four days (according to the Grattan Institute).  It means our extreme efforts to slow the rate of contagion may be working. But in the United States the situation is horrifying.   The total number of new cases there is doubling at a scary pace. According to the New York Times on Friday, the US death toll had grown six-fold in the previous eight days.  The healthcare system in some of its major cities is already at breaking point. New York is currently the country's ground zero, and the city's governor, Andrew Cuomo, says the city will run out of ventilators by the middle of this week.  They've built a field hospital in Central Park to cope with the overflow of critical patients. A few weeks ago, President Donald Trump was still saying Democrats were overhyping the situation, claiming ""this is their new hoax"".  But now, a few weeks later, his administration admits 100,000 to 240,000 Americans will probably die from the virus — and that's its best-case scenario. It demonstrates why an intuitive understanding of the maths of contagion is so important. If you don't want a deadly virus to spread through a population to the point where it overwhelms your healthcare system and other institutions, it pays to try to slow the rate of growth in new cases as early as possible. If you don't want your chessboard to start billowing grains of rice, you need to reduce the rate at which the rice is doubling. In the late 1990s, the US inventor Ray Kurzweil wrote about the importance of the ""second half of the chessboard"", saying exponential growth is still crucial in the first half, but it's in the second half when growth appears to move into hyper-speed and the human mind gets overwhelmed. Australia does not want to get anywhere near the second half of that board.   Our healthcare system has finite resources — a small number of hospitals, nurses, doctors, surgeons, and equipment — which is a deliberate policy choice. If we had 50,000 more hospitals, millions more medical staff, and all the equipment we needed, we wouldn't have to worry. But we can only work with the system we've built. For Mr Morrison, if things go well in Australia and we ""flatten the curve"" of transmission to the point where our healthcare system isn't overwhelmed and we can crawl through the pandemic until a vaccine is discovered, he'll have to live with the fact that millions of Australians will believe he's wasted all that money — $213 billion in stimulus — and pushed the country into recession for nothing. He's already acknowledged that.   It's similar to the problem former prime minister Kevin Rudd faced after he spent $67 billion to prevent Australia falling into recession during the global financial crisis. But when it comes to financial markets, investors shrugged last week when a record 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits, with large parts of the US economy finally shutting down to impede the transmission of COVID-19. It was the largest number of initial jobless claims in a single week in America's history, by a gigantic margin, but markets were more interested in Mr Trump's claim that Saudi Arabia and Russia would soon be cutting oil production by 10 million barrels a day in a bid to stabilise oil prices. Some of the investors who understand the maths of the pandemic, like the experts advising Mr Morrison, have clearly accepted that we're in this for the long haul. But others are grasping for any hint of good news. The head of the International Energy Agency, Faith Birol, said on Friday if Saudi Arabia and Russia could agree to radical cuts in oil production it still wouldn't be enough to stop a huge build-up of oil inventories in the June quarter, because global efforts to prevent the coronavirus spreading have destroyed oil demand in an unprecedented way.   He said if oil production was cut by 10 million barrels per day — roughly 10 per cent of global supply — inventories would still grow by 15 million barrels a day in the second quarter because the global demand for oil had simply collapsed. Now the world's major oil producers will be holding a 'virtual' emergency meeting on Monday to discuss possible production cuts, but will they be able to agree to a plan that puts a floor under oil prices for good? Plenty of investors hope so, but they're likely clutching at straws. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is meeting this Tuesday to discuss interest rates. But what will they discuss? They've already cut the official cash rate to 0.25 per cent and RBA governor Philip Lowe's confirmed it will stay there for years. It all depends on the maths of the coronavirus pandemic. From little things, big things grow.  ",By business reporter Gareth Hutchens,"April 06, 2020"

The Nepali national loves Australia's education system, career opportunities and lifestyle, but chief among his reasons for living and working in the ""lucky country"" for the past seven years is that everyone is treated equally. ""My boss or my manager, I still can put my opinions to them, and that's what really drove me to come to Australia,"" Mr Bhattarai said. From the end of this month, Mr Bhattarai will be without any source of income because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on his tourist-dependent job. Mr Bhattarai is on a foreign visa, meaning he is ineligible for a share in the $130 billion in wage support that passed both houses of the Federal Parliament this week.   The Hobart resident applied for permanent residency two years ago but he is yet to learn whether he has been successful. ""There are people like me who want to contribute to the economy, who are looking forward to the development of themselves and the community as they have been here for so many years,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""We want to help Australia, we want to help create a good version of Australia … and I would request that the Government not put everyone in the same basket."" The Tasmanian Government has worked hard to attract overseas residents to help boost the ageing population and fill gaps in the workforce. The entire state is classed regional, which can help a person's case in applying to become a permanent resident. The Greens tried to amend the Federal Government's JobKeeper package in Parliament on Wednesday to include income support for temporary migrants. Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim said: ""Tasmania has a significant number of foreign workers, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. ""Some business owners are doing their best to look after temporary visa holders with no income, but that should be the Government's job."" People on temporary visas are also ineligible for the JobSeeker payment.   Tasmanian state MP Madeleine Ogilvie described the situation as a ""crisis"", with staff in her office in Hobart's northern suburbs working around the clock to provide support to people like Mr Bhattarai. ""The reality is that we've invited these people here to come study with us, come work with us, come help us and be part of the community, and now things have gotten to a very, very bad stage,"" Ms Ogilvie said. ""At the moment, I don't believe that we as a country and as a state are living up to what we've offered them."" Unions Tasmania has been similarly flooded with calls from people on temporary visas unsure how they will survive without a stable income. ""They pay tax while they're here, they make a contribution, and whilst many of them are not going to be here forever, lots are building their lives here, they're building their home,"" secretary Jessica Munday said. ""We're literally talking about forcing people into destitution and homelessness at a time when we're asking them to stay at home, isolate and stay safe.""   Tasmanian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Simone Zell said member organisations were supporting overseas workers with food and welfare checks. ""The Government is in a position to offer assistance to our migrant visa holders,"" Ms Zell said. ""These people are contributing to our communities and our local economies."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier this week the Government tried to create the broadest and fairest possible JobKeeker scheme but had to ""draw the line somewhere"". The Federal Government will allow migrant workers to access up to $10,000 from their superannuation funds.   Diem Doan has been in Tasmania for about six months, describing it as ""one of the most beautiful states in Australia"". ""It's peaceful, the people here are friendly and lovely and nice, and that drew me,"" Ms Doan said from her Hobart home. ""Also, I want to get permanent residency for the long-term, and Tasmania offers state sponsorship."" After being stood down from her restaurant job, Ms Doan is unsure how she will continue to live in Australia — her home for the past six years.   Her family in Vietnam will provide some financial support, and she will continue to hunt for a new job, she said. ""I still have to go get groceries, I still have to pay for all the bills every month,"" Ms Doan said. ""Luckily my landlord reduced my rent for us, so that's a little support but it really means a lot to us."" Mr Bhattarai said Population Minister Alan Tudge's comment that people who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home was ""heartbreaking"". He and Ms Doan said they were not sure how they would even return to Asia given widespread lockdowns and a lack of flights. ""Australia is one of the countries that has taught me more than my home because I basically did my first job here, I studied my bachelor's here, I have my sisters and in-laws here,"" Mr Bhattarai said.

The number of confirmed cases in the state is now 1,241 after 13 more cases were confirmed overnight. There are now 158 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus, one more than yesterday. There are 43 people in hospital, seven more than yesterday, and 13 people are in intensive care. Another 120 people have recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 926. Police have issued another 98 fines in the past 24 hours to people flouting stage three restrictions, and carried out 754 checks on people who should be in self-isolation.   Elsewhere in the country, a 69-year-old man died from coronavirus complications overnight in New South Wales, bringing the national death toll to 53. The rise in the national death toll comes as 280 Australians have arrived in Melbourne after leaving a number of locations in Peru. They immediately boarded buses and were taken to hotels in the city for two weeks of self-isolation. More Australians stuck in Peru, Argentina and South Africa are expected to be brought home over the next week. The figures come as the Minister for Prevention of Family Violence Gabrielle Williams announced the State Government would invest $40.2 million in crisis accommodation and specialist services for people suffering or at risk of family violence.   The Government will put $20 million towards short-term accommodation for people who do not feel safe isolating or recovering from COVID-19 at home. Another $20.2 million will help family violence services meet the expected increase in demand during the health crisis. The package will include about $5 million for technology and protective equipment and targeted funding will be provided to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. The Government has also announced a plan to help Victorians experiencing homelessness who need to self-isolate. Housing Minister Richard Wynne has announced $8 million will be put towards using decommissioned aged-care homes at four Melbourne locations to house 200 people sleeping rough, and provide them with healthcare.   To be eligible for the program, people must either be waiting on test results, have a positive coronavirus diagnosis, be required to self-isolate but have nowhere to do so, or have been discharged from hospital and require accommodation to recover. ""People without secure accommodation are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they can't self-isolate or quarantine, this will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus,'' Mr Wynne said.   The housing will be operated by Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria with outreach staff providing 24-hour support. Mr Wynne also said public housing tenants' rent assessments would not be affected by any Federal Government financial stimulus payments over the coming months.   As the country gears up for a different kind of Easter, authorities around Australia are pleading with people to remain at home and not travel to regional or coastal areas this weekend. On Thursday, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville said police would be checking on travellers on roads and in tourist hotspots to make sure they were complying with coronavirus restrictions. State MP for South Barwon  Darren Cheeseman has called for Surf Coast Shire Council to close all beaches this weekend to deter people from travelling to the coast. ""They should be closed to all activity, including surfing, swimming, fishing, walking, and sunbathing,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Meanwhile, Victorian emergency departments have reported a 20 per cent drop in patients with injuries as the state's stage three lockdown continues. The Department of Health said there had been a reduction from an average of 5,000 patients per day to 4,100 per day. But while there had been an overall drop in the number of people presenting to emergency departments, some areas have seen an unexpected spike during the lockdown.   Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had received ""an influx of patients with severe burns"" from home cooking and barbecuing. ""If you are going to be cooking, please pay attention,"" she said. ""And if you're going to be barbecuing, please, please do not throw accelerants like methylated spirits or petrol onto the fire to try and get it going."" However, hospitals and medical professionals have expressed concern that emergency department numbers might be down because people were delaying vital treatment.   Stroke Foundation chief executive Sharon McGowan said some patients who were worried about being a burden on the health system or contracting COVID-19 at a hospital were not seeking help when they needed it. ""We've already heard from our clinicians on the ground of two cases where individuals with the early signs of stroke actually delayed calling triple zero,"" Ms McGowan said. Ambulance services across Victoria have also seen a 20 per cent drop in emergency calls prompting Ms McGowan to urge Australians not to play down medical emergencies during the pandemic. ""We must be looking after ourselves in Australia. Every stroke is a medical emergency, every stroke is a triple zero call.""    ",,"April 10, 2020"

The NT Government confirmed again this week that schools would be open next term and said families should plan for all school-aged children to be physically back in the classroom come April 20.  Education Minister Selena Uibo said the decision to keep schools open was based on the current medical advice and the direction from the Federal Government.  But she said exceptions would be made for parents who had informed their school that their child would be learning from home.  ""Some families may want to look at home schooling options, which is already available and has always been available,"" she said. Hard copy learning packs were being arranged for students staying at home without access to online learning technology. The minister wrote to teachers on Wednesday night, telling them ""education delivery in Term 2 will be determined by the school and tailored to the circumstances of students."" She said that school staff were using the four pupil-free days granted in this last week of term to develop the materials required for term two. But the push to prepare three different teaching models has drawn heavy criticism from Australian Education Union NT (AEU NT) president Jarvis Ryan, who said the approach was ""untenable"". ""We're disappointed, we're angry, we don't feel that teachers on the ground are being listened to,"" he said ""People are making decisions up in a bubble and they are not taking into account the incredible pressures that teachers are under.""    Mr Ryan said the union had fought to secure this week's pupil-free days to give teachers ""some breathing space"" but said ""instead what's happened has been a ratcheting up of pressure under multi-model delivery."" ""They're being bombarded with paperwork requests from the department about pandemic plans, are you planning for three scenarios, what are you doing about assessments?""  Mr Ryan said the union would advise its members not to perform additional work to cater for students who were at home. ""There will be one mode of teaching and learning — whether it's at school or at home,"" he said.   The minister acknowledged the volume of work and the pressures on staff but she said the planning required this week was necessary. ""What we don't want a case of is that we get to term two and things change and people feel unprepared,"" she said. ""We want to make sure we maximise these four days of professional development to allow for that preparedness so that if things do change, that our staff already have the tools to be able to cope with any changes.""

25,/news/2020-04-09/nt-scraps-one-to-one-solar-power-feed-in-tariff-renewables/11928988?section=business,"One-to-one solar feed-in tariff scrapped, battery subsidies announced in NT renewables changes","The phones have been ringing off the hook at Leigh Fowkes' small solar business in Katherine this week — and not in a good way.   ""Existing clients basically straight away [saying] 'put our jobs on hold',"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Mr Fowkes said about two dozen customers had shelved plans to install rooftop solar in the wake of the sudden axing of the Northern Territory's one-to-one feed-in tariff. The generous rate at which solar system-owners were paid for excess energy sent back to the grid helped drive rooftop solar uptake in the NT from the lowest levels in the country to levels that experts warned the Top End grid had not been upgraded to manage. A 67 per cent cut to the tariff for new systems — from 24 cents for every kilowatt hour down to eight — was rolled in with the Government's announcement this week of $30 million for a large-scale battery to support the Darwin to Katherine system. Renewables Minister Dale Wakefield said the battery and $800,000 in subsidies for more rooftop solar storage were ""two huge steps forward in our plan for 50 per cent renewables by 2030."" But she refused to say why the tariff change was made without notice, when the Government had promised consultations and a draft policy to be released last year. Mr Fowkes said solar installers were not prepared for a snap announcement but knew a policy change was coming. ""We all knew how unstable the grid was and how hard it was for Power and Water to maintain the voltage et cetera,"" he said. ""But a bit of notice, and maybe even some better timing, would have been helpful."" Ms Wakefield said Labor was continuing with ""the business of government"" while dealing with the coronavirus fallout, including its renewables and energy policies.   She acknowledged recent criticism by the Utilities Commission, which commented on ""significant changes"" in the Darwin to Katherine grid, where rooftop solar had ""exceeded expectations"" and 60 megawatts of large-scale solar was due for connection in coming months. The commission said it had to approve tough new technical requirements on large-scale solar generators to head off ""serious reliability and security issues"" on the system, partly because of a lack of government progress on its promised reforms. ""That's why it's been important for us to continue this work even throughout the COVID crisis,"" Ms Wakefield said. ""We want to make sure we've got a stable and strong power system that delivers what Territorians need."" The NT Government said its large-scale battery would save government-owned Territory Generation $6.4 million and 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. The author of the Government's Roadmap to Renewables report, Alan Langworthy, said Labor deserved credit for moving in the right direction, but he said there was much more reform work to be done. And he said there remained a ""very significant risk"" of a system crash on the Darwin to Katherine grid. ""It will be two years before the [large-scale] battery is up and going, and I'm not sure the current mechanisms for household use are going to change people's demand or generation model at all,"" he said. ""That still leaves the grid in quite a lot of vulnerability."" A Government spokesperson said the $800,000 set aside for battery subsidies would cover up to 130 grants. But about 12,000 households and businesses installed rooftop solar before the tariff change, according to retailer Jacana Energy. Under grandfathering arrangements, those customers will continue to receive the one-for-one rebate, surrendering it only if they move, upgrade their system capacity, or take up the battery subsidy. The Government said its tariff change was a recommendation from the roadmap report, but Mr Langworthy said the actual guidance was for the creation of a time-of-day feed-in tariff to encourage greater battery uptake. Using a time-of-day tariff, customers get paid more for their power if it is exported to the grid during a peak-demand period like the early evening. ""With net metering left in place there's no incentive for people to install a battery, so basically it's status quo,"" Mr Langworthy said. ""If the Government had in fact instituted a time-of-day tariff they could have gotten a good solid take-up of battery support delivering energy into the system when they really need it, which is in the 5:00 to 9:00 at night period."" Ms Wakefield said the Government was considering the time-of-day tariff proposal and would monitor the uptake of batteries going forward. She also said the Government would speak with small solar installers like Ms Fowkes, who were imploring the Government to allow a tariff-change grace period. ""We know that solar is still a great investment for people when people sit down and do the figures,"" she said. ""We know that solar business will continue to thrive in the Territory because Territorians have been voting with their feet because of the savings they can make on their bill.""",By Jacqueline Breen,"April 09, 2020"
26,/news/2020-04-09/amid-coronavirus-slowdown-businesses-welcome-easter-trade-boost/12134546?section=business,"Amid coronavirus slowdown, Easter brings an economic boost for WA chocolatiers and fishmongers","For Perth chocolatier Sue Lewis, the demand for Easter chocolate has thown her microbusiness a financial lifeline amid the coronavirus economic crisis.   Easter is typically her busiest period and is what sustains the business for the year, but as coronavirus takes an economic toll on businesses everywhere, this year's Easter trade has become even more vital. ""If this had happened outside Easter, during the winter, I think we would have definitely struggled,"" Ms Lewis said. With only two customers allowed in the store at a time because of physical distancing restrictions, staying afloat has meant adapting and Ms Lewis's bustling shopfront has become an online delivery service.   ""It's been very busy. We were slightly concerned as it's our busiest time of year and this is the first time we've really sold online, but it's gone gangbusters,"" she said. In a small basement kitchen in the State Buildings, Ms Lewis has been working overtime to make sure there is enough chocolate for the Easter bunny to deliver. And she said she was deeply grateful that Premier Mark McGowan's Easter Bunny ""egg-semption"" had allowed her to do just that.   But beyond Easter, the future looks uncertain and Ms Lewis said the shop was looking at ways it could stay viable. ""We'll maybe do some online classes and also take a little bit of time out just to work on new products,"" she said.     Seafood sellers also depend heavily on Easter, when many people choose to buy fish for Good Friday. West Coast Seafood owner Winton Lawton said his delivery service was typically not as busy as other seafood retailers during Easter. But this week had been the busiest in 15 years, particularly throughout the central Wheatbelt and South West regions.   ""It's a bit like Christmas [but] without the organisation and planning because it's not something that we expected,"" he said. Mr Lawson said in the past week they had delivered more than 1,000 orders — double what the business usually does. He suspected that was because coronavirus restrictions had forced people to stay home and cook, rather than eat out. At Sealanes Seafood Market in South Fremantle, early Easter sales were busy too, but operations are very different. Typically, on the Thursday before Easter, about 100 people at a time would pile into the store.   This year Sealanes has implemented strict physical distancing restrictions and limited the number of customers in the store to 30. Retail supervisor Ben Fairchild said sales in recent weeks had been strong, due to customers buying early or stockpiling. But he said buying patterns had changed — customers were purchasing smaller fillets rather than one big fish, which he said indicated people were adhering to advice and cancelling large family gatherings.     Many West Australians have had to cancel their traditional Easter long weekend getaways, with checkpoints in place to stop people travelling outside of their region for anything other than essential travel. And while long weekend double demerits still apply to anyone caught committing traffic offences, the Government is hoping that with far fewer drivers on the roads, there will be a significant drop in deaths and serious injuries, particularly on regional roads.

Thredbo, Perisher and Charlotte Pass ski resorts have all said they were closely monitoring the progress of COVID-19, but that they were also progressing plans to operate from the long weekend in June onward. The CEO of peak body Australian Ski Areas Association, Colin Hackworth, said while ski resorts were in the hands of health authorities and governments, he was confident they would have an opening of some sort. ""It will be a different season than we're used to seeing, but once the restrictions are lifted by government we can have a snow season,"" he said. Mr Hackworth said the industry was flexible and was accustomed to delayed openings. ""All of the operators are highly experienced at onboarding large numbers of seasonal workers in a pretty short time,"" he said.   But the Rural Doctors Association said it was too early to book a skiing holiday and plans for a June opening were ""unrealistic and optimistic"". ""The reality is we are only two months away from the opening of the ski season and social distancing regulations may be in place for six months,"" the association's chief executive Peta Rutherford said. ""The ski season is supposedly opening in eight weeks — that is too soon to be allowing for large gatherings of people in areas that they're not normally visiting.""   Ms Rutherford said regional health services were not equipped to deal with an outbreak of COVID-19. ""These small communities have very limited health resources. There are many risks,"" she said. Jindabyne Chamber of Commerce president Olivier Kapetanakos said it was too premature to call the entire ski season off.   ""We're at the beginning of the shutdown period. We've still got weeks to go. A lot of things can happen,"" he said. Mr Kapetanakos was hoping the current restrictions on social gatherings would help flatten the curve in time for ski resorts to open this winter. Even if restrictions remained in place throughout June, he said there was still a chance to achieve some sort of season. ""The snow stays on until late September. Even if they start in August we'll get half a season,"" he said. ""A lot of these communities live off winter. If they have six weeks or two months that's going to be a lot better than nothing.""   The Snowy Mountains' economy was severely impacted by this summer's bushfires, with thousands of tourists forced to evacuate. Mr Kapetanakos said many businesses were still counting on Perisher, Thredbo, and Charlotte Pass to open this winter. ""We didn't have a summer. If we don't have a winter that's pretty bad,"" he said. At Mount Hotham in neighbouring Victoria, the Alpine Resort Management Board is planning for a range of scenarios to project how a delayed season might operate, or worse — the impact of not opening at all.

Fifty people are in hospital including 13 people in intensive care, up from 12 who were in intensive care on Wednesday. The number of deaths remains at 12. Police Minister Lisa Neville urged people to stay at home this weekend and away from coastal communities, but conceded that legally people could visit holiday homes they owned.  ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said.  ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you."" Ms Neville said Victoria Police would be visiting coastal and regional communities making sure people were complying with coronavirus restrictions, and would be out on the roads doing road safety checks.   Ms Neville said where there were ""blatant"" breaches of the Chief Health Officer's rules, people would be fined. ""These are really tough measures, we all understand that this will be a very different Easter and it should be,"" she said.   Ms Neville said some beaches had closed completely while some had closed but were still allowing people to surf, swim and walk for exercise if they lived locally. ""Travelling from Melbourne to Lorne to surf is inappropriate,"" she said.   Police carried out 1,065 spot checks in 24 hours and issued another 78 on-the-spot fines. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the main reason fines were being issued was because people continued to gather together. ""They're still doing dinner parties, Airbnb-type parties, large groups of people together. We're having people drink in the streets, drink outside with a group of mates in parks and things like that,"" he said. ""Totally unacceptable behaviour.""   Victoria Police fined a man understood to be a member of an ultra-orthodox Jewish community for holding a group prayer session in Ripponlea in Melbourne's south-east.   In a statement, police said the man was fined $1,652 for failing to adhere to directives designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Police said they had also attended the same premises on Wednesday and issued several warnings ""to a person about organising and holding gatherings."" The other men who were at the venue were being investigated and further fines may be issued. Other examples of people who were fined included a man driving in South Melbourne who claimed he was out to buy a bottle of water, despite living in Wantirna South, and a group of six who had gathered together after previously being warned by police. The group of six told police they were ""just chilling"".   But while some breaches may be obvious, Victorian crossbenchers are calling for a review of some of the most draconian regulations, including directions prohibiting people sitting alone in public spaces and going fishing. The Reason Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens said many of the restrictions around solitary activities needed to be fine-tuned to make them sustainable for the long-term. Deputy Commissioner Patton admitted police were also fining offenders who were caught breaking criminal laws — a practice that has been criticised by lawyers. ""When we're charging them for offences such as drugs, burglary and theft they're also getting infringements issued to them,"" he said. The Deputy Commissioner said officers had been instructed to focus on breaches that were ""deliberate, blatant and obvious"" and assured people there were ""checks and balances"" in place. ""We're not perfect police officers, we will get this wrong on some occasions but when we get it wrong we'll fix it and that's what we're about,"" he said. Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson has called for roadblocks to be put in place along Victoria's Great Ocean Road to stop holiday-makers from breaching coronavirus restrictions. Under the stage three shutdown, people are legally allowed to travel to properties they own. Ms Henderson told the ABC those who were travelling illegitimately could be fined and forced to turn around.  ""There are still Airbnbs and rental homes out there on the market, which is of course prohibited,"" she said.   Ms Neville said the Chief Health Officer had not indicated there was a need for roadblocks to stop people travelling to the regions and the coast, saying she had a ""great deal of faith in Victorians"". Airbnb Australia country manager Susan Wheeldon said the company would cooperate with police on any investigations into non-essential travel. ""If you're thinking of an Easter getaway this long weekend, change your plans immediately and stay home,"" she said in a statement. ""Airbnb is extremely serious about supporting efforts to combat COVID-19."" Ms Wheeldon said the company had contacted hosts and guests to remind them to comply with local laws and had been ""actively discouraging"" hosts from inappropriately marketing listings using terms related to COVID-19, such as quarantine. ""We won't hesitate to take action, such as removal from our platform, against anyone who violates the policies we've put in place to help ensure the public's safety,"" she said.   Operation Nexus will continue this year over the Easter long weekend with an increased focus on breath testing, drug testing, and speed but booze buses will not be operating. Road Policing Assistant Commissioner Libby Murphy said rather than roadblocks, police would be focusing on enforcement and visibility. Ms Neville also said it was too early to speculate on when AFL should come back, saying it was ""way too early"" to lift restrictions. The Department of Transport has closed boat ramps, piers and jetties across Victoria in a bid to reinforce that all forms of recreational boating were not permitted under stage three restrictions. It comes after a man had to be rescued by police on Wednesday night after he crashed into rocks near Portsea while trying to reach Tasmania.   Recreational boating includes all forms of human-powered boating, including canoeing, kayaking, surf skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, rowing, all forms of powered boating such as jet skiing and all forms of wind-powered boating such as yachting, kitesurfing and windsurfing. Commercial shipping, commercial boating, land, port and waterway management functions and emergency access are exempt. Meanwhile, a significantly higher number of calls are being made to the Victoria Police assistance line. More than 600 calls are being made a day from people reporting others who breach physical-distancing rules.   Over the last two weeks, 22,500 coronavirus-related calls have been made, including 3,781 calls to report mass gatherings, 2,117 for people suspected of breaching social-isolation protocols and 1,770 for businesses breaching the restrictions. In February, the assistance line received about 61,000 calls, which was consistent with average call volumes in previous months. But in March that figure blew out to 69,000 — the highest number of calls per month since the police line launched in July last year. The line is likely to receive 80,000 calls by the end of April. Last Friday, 1,000 calls to the hotline were redirected to the DHHS website or the National Coronavirus Helpline because they were general enquiries.  ",,"April 09, 2020"

The ASX 200 closed at its highs of the session, ending up by 3.5 per cent or 180 points to 5,387. The All Ordinaries index gained 3.4 per cent to 5,439 points. Vaccine maker CSL became one of the few companies to reaffirm its profit predictions amid the virus outbreak, and its shares rose 5.5 per cent to $329. The major bank stocks did a lot of the heavy lifting this session, rebounding after heavy falls on Wednesday, with shares in ANZ (+6.6pc), Commonwealth Bank (+3.3pc), NAB (+4.8pc) and Westpac (+4.7pc) all rising. The Australian dollar was buying around 62.1 US cents, after being boosted in overnight trade as the Federal Government's $130 billion wage subsidy package was passed into law. On Asian markets Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index dipped marginally. In its latest health check of local banks, the Reserve Bank warned that Australian financial institutions may have less ability to cope with risks because of the coronavirus crisis.   In its bi-annual Financial Stability Review, the RBA said the Australian financial system had entered the crisis in a strong starting position with fewer risky loans. But it noted the virus outbreak and measures taken to contain it have created new issues. ""With many staff working from home and from different locations, financial institutions face increased operational risks and may have less capacity to take on and manage market risk,"" the central bank said. ""[Coronavirus] has changed the nature of some IT and cyber risks."" The RBA also warned that some households ""will find their finances under strain due to efforts to contain the virus"", which could increase the pressure on the banking system if people and businesses have difficulty repaying their mortgages or rent. But it said that most Australian businesses and households would be able to copy with a temporary fall in income, although financial resilience will be tested. The RBA also noted that the property market is effectively in a deep freeze, with onsite auctions banned and only a few people allowed at open houses. It said that the economic downturn, uncertainty and social distancing ""are likely to result in very little turnover in the housing market"" and it's unclear how residential property prices will be affected. There are early signs that the massive wave of stimulus rolled out by the Federal Government to combat the damage from the coronavirus has started to boost the economy. A study by credit reporting agency Ilion and economics research firm AlphaBeta found stimulus payments to households had boosted spending on essential items like groceries, office supplies and hardware.   Spending on food delivery and online retail and subscription services jumped by nearly two-thirds as government restrictions saw people largely confined to their homes. Spending on pets rose 28 per cent on its weekly average as pet adoptions and purchases increased. However, the stimulus caused unintended consequences, with online gambling jumping by 67 per cent and spending on alcohol and tobacco rising by one-third. But the study also revealed the impact of the Federal Government's move to shut down many non-essential businesses. Spending at gyms was down 95 per cent compared to normal levels, while spending on public transport slumped 78 per cent, and cafe spending fell 42 per cent. The report's author, AlphaBeta economist Dr Andrew Charlton, said the cash payments to consumers caused cash spending to come off its lows last week and rise to 16 per cent below normal levels. ""We'd seen in the last couple of weeks that there was a very negative, worrying trend in Australian consumption, which had dropped very quickly. ""But then last week, we saw the impact of stimulus rushed through the economy as nearly 6.8 million Australians began to receive their stimulus cheques and we saw big jumps in spending across the board."" The increase in spending was highest for people on low incomes who received stimulus payments, with spending in supermarkets increasing 19 per cent and brands including Costco, Kmart, Big W, McDonalds, and Domino's Pizza reaping the benefits. The coronavirus pandemic saw the US central bank decide to take ""forceful action"" last month to combat the economic damage of the outbreak. The latest minutes from two emergency meetings held last month by the Federal Reserve show officials were increasingly concerned about the rapid spread of the virus.   The Fed took unprecedented action and slashed interest rates by a full percentage point to near zero, broadened access to US dollars for foreign central banks and restarted its massive bond buying program. However, not all policymakers were on board with the big rate cut. A few officials wanted to hold fire ""to allow fiscal and public health policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak to take hold"", and were worried about sending a ""negative signal"" about the economic outlook. The Dow Jones index surged nearly 800 points in late trade this morning after US Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders dropped out of the race. That clears the way for a November election between former vice-president Joe Biden and Republican President Donald Trump. Health insurers rose on the news because Senator Sanders' Medicare for All plan would have effectively abolished private health insurance. Investors were also encouraged by signs that the coronavirus outbreak in the US may be close to a peak. The Dow gained more than 3 per cent or 780 points to 23,434. The S&P 500 rose 3.4 per cent or 91 points to 2,750 and the Nasdaq put on 2.6 per cent or 204 points to 8,091. European stock markets were mixed with the FTSE 100 ending down half a per cent to 5,678. Confidence was fragile as investors ponder whether or not Eurozone finance ministers will agree an economic rescue package. It's a similar situation for oil with a meeting tonight between OPEC and Russia to discuss production cuts in the hope of ending a damaging price war. Global demand for oil has collapsed because of the virus outbreak. West Texas crude rose nearly 11 per cent to $US26.16 a barrel on hopes of a deal which would put a floor under prices.   Kuwait's Oil Minister said talks with countries participating in the video conference will work towards an agreement to reduce production by 10 to 15 million barrels per day, according to the Al-Rai newspaper.

It follows the deaths of a 62-year-old woman who had been a passenger on the Ruby Princess and 75-year-old Adelaide man Francesco Ferraro. Mr Ferraro acquired coronavirus while interstate, and died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital on Monday. SA Premier Steven Marshall expressed his condolences to the family of the latest victim, and said it was likely he had caught the disease from one of the Barossa Valley clusters. He said it was the first time a person had died in South Australia after a COVID-19 transmission within the state that was not directly associated with travel. He warned that COVID-19 was ""a terrible, deadly, insidious disease"" and the effect of the pandemic on society would last for months.   He urged people to ""forget about your Easter holidays this year"" by staying at home. ""This is a nasty, nasty disease and that's why we're saying this Easter more than any other time: be a good egg,"" he said. As of 3:30pm today, there were 421 cases of coronavirus in South Australia, up one from Wednesday. The Premier dismissed a media report that South Australia and Western Australia may be used as a ""guinea pig state"" to trial loosened coronavirus restrictions ahead of other states. News Corp reported today that SA and WA have been identified to the National Cabinet as states where the shutdown could be loosened first, to provide a ""road map"" for other states more severely affected by COVID-19.   But Mr Marshall said now was ""not the time for complacency [and] if anything we should be redoubling our efforts"". ""I'm not talking about easing restrictions … any time soon,"" Mr Marshall said. ""No state and no territory is contemplating [lifting restrictions]. ""We're not talking about two or four weeks; we're not talking about two or four months … [the shutdown] has to be sustainable."" Eleven people have each been fined $1,060 for breaching social gathering rules at a house in Port Augusta. The group of 13 was warned four times on Tuesday and Wednesday before the fines were issued on Wednesday morning. On their first three visits, police officers found the group in the backyard or in the house, while on the last occasion all were gathered in the lounge room. Police Commissioner Grant Stevens called the breach a ""disregard for the welfare of other people"". ""It was clear our efforts to work with the community in this regard were not successful so we did what we said we would do and we issued expiation notices,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""There was no willingness to comply with our advice."" He said the party was discovered by police following noise complaints, and two members of the group are still being followed up. Those fined include men and women aged between 32 and 57.   Mr Stevens said the police force would be using its horses, helicopter, plane and drones at locations crowd might develop to enforce social distancing, especially in the country. ""There is no restriction from people visiting these locations but there is strong advice — from the Commonwealth Government, from our own State Government and from our chief public health officer: do not visit these areas,"" he said. ""These areas often comprise people from vulnerable groups in relation to this virus and unnecessary travel into those areas creates a certain level of tension and a perception of risk among those communities."" Mr Stevens has granted the Easter Bunny an exemption from border-crossing restrictions, following similar moves interstate. ""I know I'm every excited about that because I want some chocolate delivered to Norwood,"" Mr Marshall said, referring to his electorate.  Meanwhile, the South Australian Government has announced it will provide one-off, $10,000 emergency cash grants to small businesses across the state, in what the Premier has described as the most generous coronavirus rescue package for the sector in the country.   The State Government estimates about 19,000 small businesses and not-for-profits will benefit from the payments, including sporting and community organisations, gyms, hairdressers, beauty salons, restaurants, cafes and cellar doors. Mr Marshall told ABC Radio Adelaide said the package was designed to prevent a wave of business failures across the state. ""Unless we step in with this $190 million rescue package, we could see widespread business failure in South Australia,"" he said. The payments will be paid for using part of the $650 million stimulus fund the SA Government announced a fortnight ago. ""[Small businesses] are the lifeblood of our community and underpin our state's economy and we will do everything in our power to ensure they have immediate support so they have the best chance of getting through to the other side,"" Mr Marshall said.  ""We know this has been — and continues to be — an incredibly difficult time for employers and their staff, many of whom have worked tirelessly for years to build businesses and a loyal customer base.""   ""However, we hope this immediate funding shot-in-the-arm will go some way towards easing their financial distress, by improving cash flow and helping cover a range of costs, whether that be commercial rent and utility bills or supplier fees for raw materials."" To be eligible for the payment, a business must: Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas welcomed the announcement, saying that the cash payments would be ""a welcome boost for thousands of South Australian businesses and organisations which are doing it very tough"". Business SA chief executive officer Martin Haese said the State Government had responded to the pleas of businessowners on the edge. ""As the independent and local peak body for all business sectors in SA, we have been hearing heartbreaking stories of businesses on the brink of collapse,"" Mr Haese said. ""This $10,000 cash payment, which is expected to be received in the next two to three weeks, will mean businesses can now pay those rent and power bills. ""We have been advocating to the Premier and to the Federal Government for more financial support for businesses and we are pleased the Premier has answered this call for help.""
