At just 10 years old he has become a regular correspondent on ABC Grandstand. Christopher was born with Peters Anomaly, which means he is legally blind — and Grandstand is his lifeline to sport, giving him a chance to follow his beloved Brisbane Broncos. Most regular listeners would already be familiar with him. This year Christopher tackled his first season simulator call, and ABC Grandstand's lead NRL caller Andrew Moore said Chris was his favourite Grandstand contributor.  ""I'm very proud of Christopher, as he was so nervous, but the champion still managed to call his first try,"" he said.  ""I just can't believe it was David Fifita instead of his favourite, Corey Oates.""    Christopher said having Grandstand call him instead of the other way around was ""pretty cool"". ""It has been a lot of fun,"" Christopher said. ""It was a lot of fun talking to an actual player."" While Christopher cannot see the games, he said listening to the commentators was the best part and his impressive memory gives him a head start in any footy or cricket trivia. ""Me and my dad have always loved watching [rugby league] … Dad grew up watching in the 1980s and late '70s, basically his whole life, and I've grown up listening to it on the radio,"" he said.   Two-time NRL premiership winner and ABC Grandstand expert, Luke Lewis, also weighed in on Christopher's footy knowledge.  ""Christopher's attitude is always so positive and is a constant inspiration to all of us,"" he said. ""His rugby league knowledge and enthusiasm for the game is mind-blowing."" Meanwhile ABC Grandstand Expert and former NRL coach Matthew Elliott said he is just working on keeping safe from Christopher.  ""I'm scared I'll lose my job at the ABC because he's so much better and smarter than I am,"" he said.  ""I also believe he's a much better caller than Moorey. ""I listen to him talk and he lights me up with his genuine honesty and love for the game.""",ABC North West Qld      By Kelly Butterworth and Ralph Tucker,"April 10, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-10/for-these-women-religion-is-an-everyday-part-of-work/12032680,"For these women, religion is an everyday part of work — and they wouldn't change it","No matter which aged care organisation Jihan Lazki works in, as a physiotherapist she's doing the same thing. She's being kind to elderly patients, providing them with the best quality of movement she can, and making their interactions pleasant by chatting and caring. But the religious character of her place of work makes a difference to Jihan's experience. She has worked in a Christian aged care setting in the past, but now works at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first aged care home serving Muslim residents. Jihan says the ethos of respect for the elderly and putting residents' needs first is the same as at any other facility. But she tells me there's something particularly comforting about working in a Muslim organisation.   I spoke to Jihan because I wanted to explore how working within your own religious community can impact a person's sense of belonging and purpose. It can be a fraught discussion — hypotheticals swirled around the Federal Government's religious discrimination bill before coronavirus took over. The second draft of this legislation was released late last year, and changes include allowing religious bodies like hospitals and aged care providers to preference employees who belong to the same religion. The bill says this kind of discrimination is aimed at allowing these organisations to maintain their religious ethos. What I wanted to investigate was something different: employees' experience of working in a religious organisation and the impact of combining work and spiritual beliefs. On the other side of the discussion are people who work in a religious setting without sharing those beliefs. The people I spoke to emphasised the ""Christian values"" and ""Muslim philosophy"" inherent in their work — but these are principles that are shared across religious lines, and of course by people who don't subscribe to any faith at all. Jihan grew up in a Lebanese Muslim household, where her parents taught her the importance of giving back to the community. She works as a physiotherapist at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first Muslim-focused aged care facility. Staff members speak Turkish, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu to cater to a culturally diverse Muslim community. Residents ""feel at home when they know that someone can speak their language"", Jihan says. Islamic artwork decorates the home, which has dedicated prayer rooms available for residents and staff and sits next door to the Gallipoli Mosque. Staff members organise residents' treatments around their prayer times, mindful of avoiding a clash and maintaining their Muslim rituals.   Reflecting on her previous workplace, Jihan recalls having to navigate social expectations that didn't match up with her religious practices. Though she was a part of the team and liked social outings to celebrate the end of the week, as a non-drinker she felt she had to ""sit on the side"" when colleagues went to the pub. At Gallipoli Home, she says, ""they work around the religious needs that we have"". ""I can pray next door at the mosque, or I can go and pray in the prayer room, whereas at another workplace, you're scrambling to find the storeroom to pray [only] once or twice a day."" This sensitivity to religious practices means there's no extra pressure on employees like Jihan. ""I can order food straight from our kitchen and I know it's halal, whereas over there, you're looking for somewhere to get some halal food."" Breann Fallon sits on the other end of the spectrum — she works at the Sydney Jewish Museum.   ""If you're going to ask me what I tick on the census, I would tick 'other Christian',"" she says. ""Prior to working at the museum, my connections to the Jewish community were pretty much zilch."" Breann says it was a visit during her school years that prompted her interest in working at the museum. The team's ""strong mission to try and learn from the horrors of the past"" appealed to her. And she says it's their shared goal to ""try and turn it into something that we can learn from and create a better world"".   Rather than being excluded, being part of a religious workplace has given Breann a wider view of tradition and culture. ""I've been so accepted by the Jewish community here. At Easter I would do Pesach [Passover] as well as Easter. I celebrate the Jewish High Holidays as well as Christian traditions,"" she says. ""I also see value in philosophies from other faiths as well. So it's a real mixed bag for me."" Tash Holmes works at Uniting, in a job that links churches in the NSW and ACT presbyteries to the community to facilitate social justice programs. She grew up in the Baptist Church and went to a religious high school, then became involved with Hillsong through worship music.   It's been a rather roundabout route to the Uniting Church and an organisation that she says is ""anchored in compassion, respect, being bold and imaginative"". In fact, when she came out several years ago, Tash didn't see a place for herself socially in any church, let alone making her career in the community. She describes realising and sharing that she was gay while a member of Hillsong as ""coming out into a desert land"", and says she didn't know who she could rely on for support. ""There weren't a lot of accepting churches out there. And faith was still important to me,"" she explains. ""I was still wrestling between faith and sexuality and just trying to find a place where you could even talk to someone about it.""   Though she doesn't belong to the Pentecostal group anymore, it's vital for Tash to be visible as a member of the LBGTIQ+ community in a religious context. ""Uniting was the only Christian organisation that would accept me in the workplace and in their churches,"" she says. She knows there are secular social justice organisations that could offer her the same professional fulfilment, but she's able to also meet her spiritual needs through the work that she does. ""I think the church still has a lot of work to do in this space around LGBTI people of faith,"" she says. ""This is my passion. This is this is the work that I want to see out. And there's no other place to do it.""  ",ABC Radio National      By Alice Moldovan for ABC Religion and Ethics,"April 10, 2020"
2,/news/2020-04-09/camera-lost-for-8-years-found-in-5-hours-thanks-to-social-media/12136914,Camera lost for eight years found in five hours through power of social media,"When Andrew Clough lost his digital camera on a far north Queensland rafting trip in 2012, he had no idea it would become a modern-day 'message in a bottle'. The Brisbane man and his son capsized on the North Johnstone River, east of Innisfail, and the camera sank to the bottom. They spent an hour looking for it, with no luck, but Mr Clough said he still held out hope he would see the treasured device again. ""Eventually we gave up and I thought 'Well, maybe one day it'll turn up' because it was in a waterproof case,"" Mr Clough said. ""I actually thought that it might be found within a few months, it might end up in a pool downstream or on a little sandy beach and the next lot of people who go rafting down this river might come across it."" 'One day' was in fact eight years later. Incredibly, it only recently washed up on a remote Cape York beach — a staggering 450 kilometres to the north. Hope Vale local Phil Morris and his wife, Reshmi, are avid beachcombers and make regular trips to Cape Flattery to scour through the flotsam and jetsam.    ""I saw this bit of clear, hard plastic. I saw the edge of it and thought it looked like waterproof housing for a camera because we've found a few of them before,"" Mr Morris said. ""As soon as I picked it up, I saw it had a bit of rust stain and sludge on it and thought 'This looks like it's been in the water for a fair while'."" Mr Morris took the camera home, cleaned it up, and thought he would try his luck with a universal charger to get the device to power up. ""The pictures came up and I saw the [dates],"" Mr Morris said. ""I saw the photos and thought 'Wow, these are part of someone's life'. ""Photos on a camera are like your memories, part of someone's life, frozen in time."" That sentiment motivated the aged-care worker to reunite the camera with its owner so he took to social media and put the call out. Just weeks prior to his FNQ father-son bonding trip, Andrew Clough had been on another rafting expedition with a friend in Brazil. It was images from the overseas adventure that Mr Morris posted on several Facebook groups asking if anyone knew the identities of the two men.   In fewer than five hours, a friend of Andrew Clough's saw the post and sent the retired mining engineer a message that left him truly amazed. ""I subsequently contacted Phil and, sure enough, it was the camera that had been lost 450 kilometres to the south of that beach,"" Mr Clough said. ""It's a modern message in a bottle."" Mr Clough had backed up the photos from Brazil upon his return in 2012 but is grateful to now have the images from a special time with his son. ""The exciting thing for me is I took photos on the North Johnstone, which obviously I don't have, but I'm expecting to see photos of my son and myself on this trip that I thought had been lost forever."" The camera will be in transit once again, this time by mail, when Phil Morris mails it back on his next trip to Cooktown. Both men say the experience has sparked a new friendship based on a mutual love of adventure in the outdoors and the Cloughs are planning a trip to the far north so the two can meet in person. ""We've swapped stories about our experiences in the wild, he's told me about how he's come across taipans in the bush and boating along the north tropical coast,"" Mr Clough said. ""He seems like a good, down-to-earth, decent human being."" The feeling is mutual. ""He's adventurous and I'm adventurous,"" Mr Morris said. ""Hopefully when all of this drama that we're having worldwide is over, it'll be nice for them to come up."" Mr Morris plans to take the Cloughs to the very beach where the long-lost camera was finally found.  ",ABC Far North      By Brendan Mounter,"April 09, 2020"
3,/news/2020-04-09/online-gaming-hits-huge-numbers-during-coronavirus-pandemic/12135714,Online gaming is getting a big boost from the coronavirus pandemic — and experts say it's just the beginning,"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, most Australian parents would agree that online gaming was a lot more than just a growing trend.   Already a hundred-billion-dollar global industry, online gaming has become a popular pastime for many, and even a full-blown profession for some. Dedicated esports arenas, huge tournaments and the migration of traditional sport into the virtual world in recent years have proven it was already here to stay. But off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, the proliferation of online gaming in households is predicted to go to the next level. James Birt, Associate Professor in Information and Computing Science at Bond University, has studied emerging technology for the past 20 years and says he is seeing record-breaking levels of participation.   Some game manufacturers across the world have reported downloads have more than doubled, while a staggering 1.2 billion hours of content was consumed on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""The number of people playing games is off the charts, we have never seen this many players streaming and playing simultaneously online, in the history of gaming,"" Associate Professor Birt said. Earlier this week, Twitch reported it had more than 4 million concurrent viewers on its platform for the first time, after the release of Valorant, by Riot Games. ""I think what COVID-19 has really created is this point in time that one could say, is when this movement happened,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""Kids, esports enthusiasts, just [the] general public are getting into games in a way that they have never done in history. ""What we see now is those people that hadn't engaged in esports and gaming prior to the pandemic are now driving in droves towards new opportunities new experiences, new collaborative opportunities with friends.""     Motorsport is one of a number of Australian sports well placed during the downtime to take advantage of the booming interest and willingness of fans to watch online games. The inaugural All Stars Eseries event took place on Wednesday night and saw drivers competing remotely against each other online, in the first of 10 rounds. It was broadcast live on Fox Sports and streamed across multiple social platforms.   The competition followed the script from recent years in Supercars, with 2018 and 2019 series champion Scott McLaughlin winning two of the three races. The first two races featured the Phillip Island virtual circuit, while the final race was held using a digital version of the famous Monza track, home of the Italian Formula One grand prix. Like almost all of Australian sport, the traditional Supercars series — in which drivers and teams compete on tracks around the country — is on hold because of the pandemic. Instead, simulators have been installed in the homes of 25 drivers, who are getting used to the idea of getting suited up and racing the competition from the comfort of their own living space.   Holden driver Chaz Mostert has welcomed the initiative. ""Supercars has done all that it can to set this up so we can at least keep the fans entertained at home … I'm sure it's killing people like myself who wish we were racing, on the track, but we're making do with what we can at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a bit different, strolling down the stairs and going into the garage [to the simulator], it's a bit more unique than getting on a plane and going to a round!"" Similar moves are taking place in the United States, where NBA players have been pitted against each other in a special NBA 2K tournament, set to broadcast on ESPN. It is an example of how esports can also showcase sports stars in a unique way, by cutting to player reactions and banter over a mix of gameplay. Associate Professor Birt says many sports should be looking to take advantage of the unique opportunities that online gaming presents, given sports entertainment can now easily cross digital borders. ""The increase in the power behind the computing and the capacity to present the materials in 4K, we really are moving towards photo-realism in our games,"" he said. ""We are going to see even more dramatic increases this year with the release of things like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox [Series X],"" he said.   Mostert himself has been blown away by the quality of the visuals in his gaming experience, and said he was interested in being able to see the races on replay to get a different perspective from the simulator. ""I think we [drivers] are like fans, we're still going to be watching [the replay] tomorrow, even though the race happened today,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to having good on-track battles as well, it's still the same competition that we're used to out in the real world, and no doubt we'll still be racing for sheep stations in the virtual world as well."" With traditional sport still in a pandemic-induced hiatus, esports is expected to further develop its role in the Australian sporting landscape in the months ahead. ""I think there is this incredible blend between the technical capacity of esports to essentially get into people's living rooms,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""What television hasn't been able to do is create that connection between players, the games and the brands.""    ",By Patrick Galloway,"April 09, 2020"
4,/news/2020-04-09/lonely-planet-to-cut-melbourne-office-as-coronavirus-hits-sales/12136662,Lonely Planet to close most of its Melbourne office as coronavirus impacts sales,"Travel publisher Lonely Planet has announced it will close most of its operations in Melbourne and London as the company deals with the impacts of coronavirus on its sales.   The company said it had made the ""difficult decision to reduce its publishing operations for the foreseeable future"". Lonely Planet said it would continue to publish guidebooks and phrasebooks. But it said it would not commission any new ""inspirational"" titles and would stop publishing the Lonely Planet magazine. ""Lonely Planet is currently proposing that its operations in London and Melbourne close almost entirely, with impacts in other Lonely Planet locations around the world,"" the company's communications manager Adam Bennett said. Lonely Planet was founded in 1973 when Australian couple Tony and Maureen Wheeler published their first guidebook, Across Asia on the Cheap. The company became a favourite of many travellers, with its guidebooks pored over in hostels and bars around the world. Mr Wheeler, who no longer has any official role with the company, told the ABC he was ""shocked"" by Lonely Planet's announcement. ""I was surprised and I continue to be surprised, I am waiting to hear more about it,"" he said. He said Lonely Planet had been a healthy business before coronavirus shut down the travel industry. Mr Wheeler said he thought much of the company's activity had still been occurring from the London and Melbourne offices, but said an office in Dublin had been growing. ""It always surprised me how big and busy the UK office was, that was becoming more the centre around the world where things were happening,"" he said. ""Although a lot was still happening in Melbourne as well.""   He said traditionally the company used its UK office to look after European publications, Australia was used to cover the Asia Pacific and an office in the US looked after the Americas. Mr Wheeler said he had heard from staff at Lonely Planet that there had been an increasing push towards using technology to update guidebooks in the past decade, and said the coronarvirus outbreak could prompt the company to accelerate that shift to cut costs. ""Much more they update things where the rewriting is effectively done by the computers,"" he said. ""They feed the prices in, the computer then says what rooms cost in that hotel or a meal at that restaurant, so there has been this increasing automation of the writing process if you like."" He said the coronavirus crisis meant many travel companies will essentially be start-up businesses when they can re-open, but he is hopeful domestic travel will be allowed again in the not-too-distant future. The coronavirus crisis is not the only challenge Lonely Planet has faced in recent years. Its ownership has changed hands twice, with the BBC's commercial arm buying a majority stake in 2007 from the Wheelers. A year later a former guidebook author revealed he had written for Lonely Planet about a country that he had not actually visited. BBC Worldwide later sold the company to NC2 Media — a company based in Nashville, Tennessee in the United States. It has had to cut staff previously as the company dealt with the transition to digital publishing. In 2013 it cut about 80 roles, with most of the job losses coming from the Melbourne office.",By Elise Kinsella,"April 09, 2020"
5,/news/2020-04-09/restless-dance-theatre-loses-australia-council-funding/12133156,Australia Council funding cut to Adelaide troupe leaves dancers with disabilities in limbo,"Internationally renowned choreographer Michelle Ryan is using her time in self-isolation during the coronavirus pandemic to save her dance company.   The Australia Council has announced the winners and losers of its latest four-year funding process, with Restless Dance Theatre joining the likes of La Mama Theatre in Melbourne and The Blue Room Theatre in Western Australia in having its main source of revenue axed. The company, which provides paid work for dancers with disabilities, currently receives more than $300,000 per year as part of a four-year funding arrangement, and had applied to the Australia Council to increase that figure. Instead, its funding was cut entirely — a move that has left Ryan devastated. ""I was absolutely shocked,"" she said. ""I thought that our application was very strong and we have such a point of difference to everyone.""   Arts Industry Council of SA chairwoman Gail Kovatseff was critical of the decision to take funding away from an employer of artists with disabilities. ""I was profoundly shocked, and the reason why I was profoundly shocked was that they are not just a nationally regarded company, but an internationally regarded company, working in diversity,"" she said. ""Diversity is a strong criteria for the Australia Council."" She said while Australia Council funding to South Australia had ""been in decline for some time"", the loss would not only be felt this year but would have a ""cumulative impact"". Ms Kovatseff said smaller companies like Restless Dance Theatre were already disadvantaged because they did not have the staff to target alternative financial sources, such as philanthropy. A spokeswoman for the Australia Council acknowledged that Restless Dance Theatre was highly regarded within the national dance sector, a fact that had been recognised by those who assessed its funding application. However, she also said competition for the four-year funding was fierce and demand had continued to exceed the budget capacity.   Some within the dance sector are bitter that Restless Dance Theatre lost its funding while others including the Australian Dance Theatre had their funding renewed. A spokesman for the Australian Dance Theatre did not want to compare the two funding bids. However, he said the company would be supporting Restless Dance Theatre and the two troupes were in ongoing communications about how that would work. The news of the funding cut came less than two weeks after Ryan was named as the winner of the 2020 Australia Council Award for Dance. Battling multiple sclerosis, which ended her dance career, Ms Ryan has been locked in self-isolation for three weeks.   She is spending much of her time on her mobile phone and computer trying to save the company. ""I moved to Adelaide for this job and really work has been my life,"" she said. ""I've had two Zooms [online meetings] today and I ended up in tears, but I'm also quite a strong person when I get a fire in the belly. ""I just really believe in the work that we do and we need to find a way."" Almost 150 arts organisations across Australia will get money from the annual allocation of nearly $32 million. Nine of those organisations are from South Australia, a drop from 11 in the current funding period. To soften the blow, the Australia Council will provide ""transitional"" funding for one year to companies which missed out. For Restless Dance Theatre, that equates to about $217,000 — a figure which would lead to job cuts, as well as less paid work for dancers. Beyond that, Ryan fears for the future of the company that had been set to tour internationally again, before travel was restricted to halt the spread of coronavirus.",By Matthew Smith,"April 09, 2020"
6,/news/2020-04-09/history-of-the-oxford-english-dictionary/12010628,How the Oxford English Dictionary was brought to life in a rustic 'scriptorium',"Just to work from ""A"" to ""ant"" took the original Oxford English Dictionary team around 10 years. They thought they'd reach ""Z"" in that time — but gathering definitions for hundreds of thousands of words was a mammoth task, especially in the 1870s without the help of technology. ""It is akin to mapping the human genome. It was that big an enterprise,"" says author Pip Williams, who has researched the dictionary's history. And it ended up taking another six decades to complete. There had been a ""go-to"" wordlist, Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, since 1755. But Williams says it included made-up definitions and idiosyncratic spelling, and was ""completely incomplete"".   The Philological Society of London decided they needed a better dictionary — one that documented every single word in the English language — and appealed to the Oxford University Press to fund it. Editor Frederick Furnivall kicked things off, but his work didn't prove fast enough. So a few years in, James Murray, an old school teacher, took over. Murray worked from his Oxford home, in a corrugated iron shed at the back of his garden that had the romantic designation of ""scriptorium"". ""That's where he and his team of lexicographers and assistants went every day to collate and to draft the definitions of every word in the English language,"" Williams says. But they didn't work alone. Murray enlisted the help of thousands of ordinary people. He sent a call-out to the public, in pamphlets distributed far and wide and republished in certain journals, asking people to find quotations from magazines, journals, books or newspapers containing words he and his colleagues were looking for. People from all around the world began mailing tiny little slips, about the size of a postcard, containing references to words the dictionary team sought. ""They'd be stored in pigeonhole shells around the walls of the shed, that were specifically designed to hold the slips,"" Williams explains. ""Those examples — they were the evidence, essentially, of the meaning of the word.""   The team would sort the slips chronologically to determine the history of word, from the oldest example of its use to the most up-to-date. ""The lexicographers' job was to go through these textual examples of words, fashion meanings and show how a word might have changed throughout history. That's what would be put in as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary,"" Williams says. This is where the Oxford differentiates itself from Australia's Macquarie or Collins dictionaries. ""Those dictionaries give us some modern up-to-date meaning of a word, but they don't give us the history of the word,"" Williams says. ""Whereas the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical text, so it gives you the history of the word. It gives you the earliest known use of the word in text, which is really important. ""It takes you from maybe the 1530s all the way up to 2020."" If you were to look up, say, ""pants"" in a modern Oxford dictionary, you'd learn that in the 1800s the word was considered a ""vulgar abbreviation"" of pantaloons.   The rustic scriptorium, with its busy-bee lexicographers and garden surrounds, might sound idyllic, but it contained tension, too. ""There would be these perennial arguments about which words were worthy of being in the dictionary and which weren't,"" Williams says. Murray wanted a dictionary that documented all words, including the colloquial or informal.   But the delegates of Oxford University Press — who were funding the project — were keen for a more efficient approach. ""They were constantly putting pressure on Murray to curtail the number of words that were in the dictionary,"" Williams says. ""They were saying, 'some words are not as important as others'."" Williams researched the original dictionary for her book, The Dictionary of Lost Words. She was curious about what words were left out, given one specific criterion for entry.   ""If a word wasn't written down, it never had a chance of being in the dictionary,"" she explains. ""How many situations, particularly pre-20th century, would there have been where people were using language in a very specific way, in a very specific situation — like the birthing room, or the laundry, or the scullery, or the coal mine? ""And those words, because they're not written down, because the people who use them are illiterate very often, and because there's nobody listening to them or wanting to record their experience, those words are lost to history, because they're lost to the dictionary."" She says this fact reveals a serious fallibility. ""We do not question dictionaries,"" Williams says. ""If you want to solve a Scrabble dispute, you go to the dictionary and no-one will argue about the validity of the dictionary's meaning of the word. ""And all of a sudden I thought, well, hang on a minute. You can argue it, because the original source is biased.""   And not just because it documents only the written word. At the time of the first dictionary, the texts available to lexicographers — technical manuals, professional texts, literature and journalism — were mostly written by men. ""That first dictionary had to be a gendered text,"" Williams says.  ""The original sources were mostly written by men and the people interpreting them were men; the people drafting the definitions were men. ""They had the power to exclude, and had the power to include.""   But women were significantly involved in the compilation of the dictionary, Williams says. ""There were women assistants. There were women volunteers, but we don't know much about them,"" she says. She is frustrated by the lack of recognition for these women — something exemplified by an event in 1928. That year a dinner was held in London's Goldsmith's Hall to celebrate the completion of all sections of the dictionary — so auspicious an occasion the prime minister Stanley Baldwin presided over it.  In attendance were 150 men. Despite some women having worked on the dictionary for as long as 50 years, none scored an invite. However, Williams says three women who had contributed invaluable work to the dictionary — Edith Thompson, Rosfrith Murray and Eleanor Bradley — were allowed to sit in balcony of the hall ""and watch the men eat"". The Oxford dictionary, which recognises that the English language is continually evolving, constantly collects new words and new meanings.  And words are never removed — they form part of the dictionary's picture of history. ""It's fascinating to see the trajectory of a word and [their] life cycles,"" Williams says. ""Climate emergency"" was the 2019 Oxford Word of the Year — ""carbon footprint"" was 2007's — additions that confirm that the dictionary's wordlist is anything but static, and always revelatory.

7,/news/2020-04-09/netflix-unorthodox-shira-haas-orthodox-judaism-true-story/12133450,Netflix series Unorthodox is bringing the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community into the mainstream,"If you've had a moment to collect your thoughts and breathe after bingeing the truly wild documentary series Tiger King, you might've noticed another Netflix series that has been trending this week that's also based on a true story.   Unorthodox is a four-part German-American miniseries and Netflix's first offering to be told primarily in Yiddish. It might not have big cats and a throuple marriage, but it does take place in a world that at times feels as foreign and unknowable as Joe Exotic's.  Unorthodox tells the story of Esty Shapiro (Israeli actor Shira Haas), a 19-year-old newly married woman who was born and raised in the Satmar Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, New York. But as Esty says, ""Williamsburg is not America"". The people in Esty's community are ultra-Orthodox adherents to the Jewish faith — Yiddish-speakers and descendants of Holocaust survivors who are determined to maintain their culture, community and beliefs and protect themselves from another Holocaust. They have their own schools, medical service and police. There are strict rules and conventions, based on interpretations of the Torah, that govern this community and dictate the way people live their lives — from the way they dress to how they marry.   At the beginning of Unorthodox, Esty flees this community — and her arranged marriage — to Berlin, the home of her estranged mother. There she falls in with a group of classical music students from across the globe, as she begins to explore the secular world and her freedom. But under the orders of their Rabbi, her young husband Yanky (Israeli actor Amit Rahav) is trailing her, desperate to bring her home, with the help of his no-good cousin Moishe (German-Israeli actor Jeff Wilbusch) who has recently returned to the fold. In flashbacks to Esty's life in Brooklyn, we see just how cloistered and difficult her life has been.  There are heartbreaking scenes where we see Esty learn about the existence of her vagina for the first time on the eve of her wedding, visit the mikvah that will render her ready for intercourse, and witness her pain (physical and emotional) as the couple tries to consummate their marriage and conceive a child.   The series is based on Deborah Feldman's 2012 bestselling memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots. Feldman grew up in Williamsburg's Satmar Hasidic community, and by age 17 she was married to a Talmudic scholar.  In The Guardian, Feldman wrote that ""as a woman in the Hasidic community, my singular contribution to society had rested on my ability to marry and have children. My role was special and holy, but it was certainly the only role I could play. Housewife. Mother. For everything else I could depend on my husband"". The flashback scenes in the series are all based on her memoir, including her paltry ""sex education"" and how she had to shave her head and begin wearing a wig once she was married.   Feldman left the community in her early 20s, taking her young child with her. Series creators Anna Winger (creator of German TV dramas Deutschland 83 and Deutschland 86) and Alexa Karolinski (director of German documentary Oma & Bella) worked with many members and ex-members of the Hasidic community in the making of the show. Some have disputed the accuracy of the depictions of the Satmar community, but Dassi Erlich, who grew up in Melbourne's Adass Israel Hasidic community, told Australian Jewish online newspaper Plus61J: ""It's very rare to see the life that I lived depicted on screen so accurately and so well. It's very rare to see it in mainstream media."" Erlich, who is a survivor of sexual abuse from within the Adass Israel community, also described the series as both ""validating"" and ""triggering"".   Where the series departs from Feldman's memoir is in the present-day story that takes place in Berlin. Explaining this decision in Making Unorthodox, Karolinski says: ""Anna [Winger] and I wanted to make a show … in which we could work through a lot of the topics we discuss a lot, especially about being Jewish in Germany."" New York Times television critic James Poniewozik recommended the show, describing it as ""a story of personal discovery with the intensity of a spy thriller"". Jen Chaney in Vulture writes that Unorthodox ""feels right for this moment"" and that ""Esty is undergoing an incremental rebirth after being shut away from the wider world for a very long time. Right now, in particular, it is a gratifying, beautiful thing to witness"".   My two cents: While the Hasidic world is portrayed with a suffocating richness, the secular world of Esty's new friends and new life feels, at times, a little hollow. There is also a heavy-handed approach to the way the series deals with the reverberations of the Holocaust.  In an early scene, one of the music students suggests that the group shows Esty something nice in Berlin, and Israeli music student Yael (Tamar Amit-Joseph) jokingly replies: ""Like what? Hitler's bunker? … Or we can take selfies at the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe?"" But Haas' Esty does redeem these missteps.  Haas is a petite actor who delivers a huge performance — her expressive face swiftly and evocatively darts from hope to betrayal, fear and uncertainty — which holds the series together, and I quickly found myself hooked, invested and rooting for her. And the hunched and cowed way both Haas and Rahav play the newlyweds in the flashbacks, dwarfed by their family and community expectations, is utterly compelling.   Besides Deborah Feldman's book, there are many true stories — including from the ABC and the New York Times — of people who have left Orthodox Jewish communities. At times, Unorthodox feels restrained in comparison to these. For example, the 2017 Netflix documentary One of Us, which is about three people who are trying to leave their Hasidic communities, includes the story of one woman — Etty — a victim of physical and emotional abuse who must choose between her children and her freedom. There's also a masterfully told two-part episode of the podcast Reply All about a Hasidic man using the internet for the first time. In terms of other fictional accounts of life in an Orthodox community, Haas made her name on the two-season Israeli family drama Shtisel (also available on Netflix). In Shtisel, the otherness of the Haredi life is superseded by the universality of their struggles — yes they live a life far from our secular world and far from our reckoning, but actually what Shulem Shtisel (Dov Glickman) is struggling with is something we can all understand: how to love and how to be.  Unorthodox is now available to stream on Netflix  ",ABC Arts      By Hannah Reich for The Screen Show,"April 09, 2020"
8,/news/2020-04-08/arts-sector-say-need-emergency-funding-to-survive-shutdown/12130398,Coronavirus has shut down Australia's arts industry but artists say the Government has ignored them,"Artists were among the first workers affected by government interventions to inhibit the spread of COVID-19, when the lights were turned out at every theatre and nearly every exhibition space in Australia. MEAA Equity president Chloe Dallimore has summarised the outcome as ""mass job losses, overnight, with no entitlements/benefits"". TV presenter and performer Julia Zemiro said she has serious fears for friends and colleagues and is regularly checking in with them. ""The arts have been slammed, we need to put it out there that artists have a unique set of circumstances in how we work,"" she said.   As Parliament prepared to sit on Wednesday to consider the next stimulus measures, artists' calls for sector-specific support measures were increasingly distressed. On Tuesday, the National Association for Visual Arts (NAVA) launched the 24-hour campaign #createaustraliasfuture, in which big names like Richard Roxburgh, Julia Zemiro, John Bell and Rachael Maza rally behind the cause. New figures compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal 53 per cent of small arts and recreation businesses have now closed their doors. The figures capture a very broad range of organisations but even so, they are higher than every other sector, including accommodation and food services — which has seen 31 per cent of businesses closed.   Hospitality workers with regular shifts are eligible for the Federal Government stimulus schemes but the majority of arts workers are not. For example, Amala Groom, one of 50,000 artists who make up the 600,000 workers in Australia's $100 billion arts sector, is not eligible for JobSeeker.  Groom started working as a conceptual artist in her mid-30s, after a successful career in Aboriginal advocacy that took her to the United Nations.   Six years later, the Wiradjuri woman was poised to enjoy a breakthrough year with a back-to-back international schedule of paid residencies, institutional and commercial exhibitions, and major projects including her first documentary — all of them career highlights. All this is now cancelled and she does not even know what to work towards as galleries cannot schedule exhibitions with any certainty and most art prizes are on hold.   ""How do I prove [this year's work ever existed] when it was all in the future?"" Groom said. ""Unless the Australian arts sector gets an industry-specific stimulus package, it's going to be impossible for artists like me to claim any [income] support"".    Julia Zemiro has recorded all but two episodes for her upcoming ABC series Home Delivery. She is disappointed to have cancelled the big annual RocKwiz Easter weekend Melbourne Comedy Festival live show and regional tour, which she hosts. She is heartbroken about the cancellation of her second, and what was to be her final, Adelaide Cabaret Festival as artistic director in June, and the opportunities it would have provided performers, that will in all likelihood now never happen. Groom and Zemiro's patchwork careers are typical of all kinds of workers in the arts. The I Lost My Gig website, established to track COVID-19-related cancellations, has logged $330 million in lost gigs. Under the headline ""Support is Here"" it lists a phone number for the music and performing-arts wellbeing helpline Support Act, and a phone number for Lifeline. Dozens of artists have added their voices to a whole-of-industry campaign launched under the banner ""Create Australia's Future"" seeking allowances for the patchwork, freelance and uneven nature of arts work. Richard Roxburgh said the industry shutdown would result in the loss of Australian stories.   ""Every artist has lost their audience and therefore the income stream they normally generate for themselves. This industry is on the brink of collapse,"" he said. ""We are keenly aware we are not on the frontline wearing PPE but we are your voice. We need to make sure after this pandemic has passed Australia still has a voice to tell the beautiful, eccentric, crazy, dark, hilarious and profound stories of who we are as a people,"" Roxburgh said. Groom, Zemiro and Roxburgh are joined by Mitchell Butel and John Bell, directors Daina Reid and Rachael Maza, fellow artists Sally Smart and Abdul-Rahman Abdullah representing freelancers and more than 160 organisations that engage them. Smart has not even seen the finished exhibition of her work being staged by Bendigo Art Gallery in Victoria, which was open for one day before the doors were closed. She is among the lucky ones, because her exhibition, years in the making, was completed and funded — but there are no guarantees an audience will ever see it, and future commissions are in jeopardy. ""We want the Prime Minister to acknowledge how the sector is suffering, as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has done,"" Smart said.   Arts minister Paul Fletcher said when the JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes were announced that they could amount to billions in assistance for the arts. ""We know COVID-19 is having unprecedented effects on our artists, arts workers and the entire sector. This measure protects jobs, supports individuals and hands a lifeline to organisations during this challenging period,"" Minister Fletcher said. However, these measures are ineffectual for many arts organisations.    On the employer side, organisations need to show at least 15 per cent COVID-19-related downturn in income if they are not-for-profit, and 30 per cent if they're for-profit — but uneven cash flow is typical for arts organisations funded by box office and sometimes grants, sponsorship and philanthropy. These companies are under huge pressure to be eligible because at the moment they feel like they are letting their casual workers down. ""We need a different way of demonstrating eligibility,"" said Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts and campaign leader.   As it stands, organisations which should be eligible are not, she said.  Artspace in Sydney is a case in point: it is ineligible for JobKeeper because it receives a significant amount of income from philanthropy, benefaction and sponsorship which will likely be reduced by this crisis. Unlike retail, where income over the counter is reasonably regular, Artspace's irregular large chunks of income might not materialise this year on account of the downturn.   The same conundrum is evident at theatres and galleries run by councils and universities, which the Prime Minister has said are ineligible. On the employee side, casuals and those on short-term contracts, such as musical theatre workers engaged for the run of a show, are also ineligible. Cast rehearsing for Disney's Frozen the Musical, due to open in Sydney in July, for example, would have reasonably expected at least a full year of work ahead, even though they had only signed up in recent months. The cast — and crew — are in limbo given the uncertainty about when social distancing restrictions will be lifted, allowing Frozen to open. Currently, they would be ineligible for JobKeeper while they wait. Anatolitis said that rather than having had to work with an employer for a year to qualify for JobKeeper, a three-month qualifying period would better suit the short-term nature of arts work. To receive the more generous payment, double the previous Newstart allowance, workers need to prove a loss of income caused by COVID-19 but, as with businesses seeking to access JobKeeper, that ""loss of income"" can be hard to demonstrate.  Screen director Daina Reid was two weeks into shooting episodes for series four of The Handmaid's Tale in Canada when production was halted and she re-joined her family in Melbourne. Reid is not eligible for JobSeeker due to the duration of her contract and working overseas, but says that being freelance, she carefully manages her finances to accommodate swings and roundabouts.  ""[But] so much of my life is filled with actors, writers and crew, I wanted to add my voice in an effort for this campaign to be heard,"" she said. Anatolitis cites the case of an Adelaide artist who has lost $60,000 on account of Dark MOFO being cancelled — the equivalent of two years' work. Even a modest $1,000 or $2,000 grant from local or state government would result in JobSeeker being lost because the grant is counted as income, even though it is generally for materials and an artist fee.  ""It's truly awful, and so easily repairable,"" Anatolitis said.    ","ABC Arts      By national arts, culture and entertainment reporter Michaela Boland","April 08, 2020"
9,/news/2020-04-08/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-at-73-of-coronavirus-compli/12132638,Grammy-winning songwriter John Prine dies at 73 of coronavirus complications,"Grammy-winning singer John Prine, who wrote his early songs in his head while delivering mail and went on to become one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, has died due to complications from coronavirus.   He was 73. Prine's publicist confirmed the singer-songwriter died due to complications from COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Nashville. Prine was hospitalised on March 26 suffering from symptoms of COVID-19, according to his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, who was also his manager. ""We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,"" the Recording Academy, which gives out the Grammy Awards, said in a written statement. ""Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John's impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.""   Born in Chicago on October 10, 1946, Prine's older brother taught him to play guitar at the age of 14. After graduating from high school in suburban Maywood, Illinois, Prine worked as a mail carrier for five years, performing in Chicago clubs in the evenings at occasional ""open mic"" nights. He would say later that some of his best-known early songs were written while he walked the streets of Chicago delivering mail.   ""I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books,"" he told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview. ""You just had time to be quiet and think, and that's where I would come up with a lot of songs. If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down."" He was drafted into the US Army in 1966, and was stationed in Germany during the Vietnam War, before returning home to dedicate himself to music and establishing himself as a leading member of Chicago's folk revival scene. Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson fatefully saw Prine performing at the Earl of Old Town club, leading to Prine's signing with Atlantic Records and self-titled debut album, released in 1971. That album, widely praised by critics, contained several songs that would become staples of Prine's catalogue.   They included Angel from Montgomery, about a woman wishing for deliverance from her unfulfilling life, Paradise, about a Kentucky town devastated by strip mining, and Sam Stone, chronicling the downward spiral of a drug-addicted Vietnam War veteran and containing the oft-quoted refrain: ""There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes, Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose."" The songs have since been covered dozens of times by other artists. His early songwriting style earned comparisons with folk great Bob Dylan, who later called Prine one of his favourites. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs,"" Dylan told the Huffington Post in 2009. Prine released a string of albums in the 1970s, winning larger audiences and critical acclaim as his music stretched from folk to country to Americana, often infused with a sense of humour. In the 1980s, fed up with the recording industry, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, releasing albums under that imprint for the next several decades.   He won his first Grammy Award in 1991, Best Contemporary Folk Album, for The Missing Years. He would win a second Grammy in the same category in 2005 for Fair and Square. In December 2019, the Recording Academy honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.   Prine survived squamous cell cancer in 1998, undergoing surgery to his neck and tongue that left his voice with an even deeper, gravelly tone. In 2013, he was diagnosed with cancer in his left lung and had it removed. Prine was able to find humour in his struggle with cancer, joking that it actually improved his voice. The same humour suffused much of his work, alongside its poignant commentary about the struggles and foibles of ordinary people. ""If I can make myself laugh about something I should be crying about, that's pretty good,"" he once said. Reuters    ",,"April 08, 2020"
10,/news/2020-04-08/producers-pivot-to-feel-good-films-amid-covid-19/12120126,Coronavirus pandemic spurs Australian movie producers to favour feel-good films,"Veteran Australian film producers are shelving violent movies in favour of feel-good drama and comedy, anticipating strong demand for uplifting cinema once the COVID-19 lockdown ends.   David Lightfoot is the producer of one of the most terrifying films to come out of Australian cinema in 20 years: the outback horror-thriller Wolf Creek. But you won't find him working on anything like that now.  He is putting violent films on the backburner to focus on uplifting drama and comedy, hoping to anticipate what audiences will want when the COVID-19 pandemic has let up enough for the cinemas to reopen.  ""We wouldn't dare to go making [a] Wolf Creek[-style film] after the virus has settled, because it's just going to scare the living daylights out of people,"" Mr Lightfoot said. ""It's just not going to fly … the market wouldn't touch it. ""People have to recover from the trauma of all this virus stuff.""     Mr Lightfoot said he and other veteran Australian film producers were taking their cues from history.  He cited the dominance of slapstick comedy — Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, and the like — in the decade following the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918, and the success of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire musicals following World War II as evidence that cinema-goers want films that uplift them following a global crisis. ""For over 100 years the same thing [has] happened after every disaster … entertainment and the arts … predominantly lean towards making people feel good,"" Mr Lightfoot said. ""We're quite sure that it's going to happen again. ""We are going to want heroes again … [and] we're going to want the modern version of Love Actually.""   The film industry has, in large part, shut down in Australia because of coronavirus restrictions: it's near-impossible to film scenes when actors must stay 1.5 metres away from one another, and when few people can gather in one place. Releases of major blockbusters — including the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, and Disney's live action remake of Mulan — have reportedly been delayed, while production has been shut down on other major films, including Warner Brothers' The Matrix 4, The Batman, and the Harry Potter spinoff, Fantastic Beasts 3.   In the meantime, Mr Lightfoot and his colleagues are doing what they can — working with government film investment agencies, developing ideas and scripts, and editing, remotely. Tim White is another leading Australian producer expecting a shift towards ""entertaining, uplifting, inspiring"" cinema in the aftermath of the pandemic. His credits include the Heath Ledger action comedy Two Hands, the 2003 historical drama Ned Kelly and last year's popular sci-fi thriller I Am Mother.   Mr White said Australian audiences could expect more films in the vein of last year's biographical drama Ride Like a Girl — about the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup — and the romantic comedy Top End Wedding.  ""Most people want to go to the cinema in particular for either a great, big … rollercoaster experience [such as a Marvel comic book film] or something that's generally going to be uplifting,"" he said. ""The great thing about the cinema is, it's a collective experience … it isn't the same to go watch a comedy sitting on [a] couch. It's just not the same."" Sydney-based producer Louise Smith, who worked on Dance Academy: The Movie and Riot, said she regularly worked on ""feel-good"" films in any case. ""I'm in the fortunate position where I haven't had to pivot,"" Ms Smith said. ""A lot of the projects that I have already been developing have a greater chance of survival … because I think people are looking for optimistic [cinema]."" Ms Smith stressed that nobody could really know what audiences might want in several months' time, but films that make people feel good were probably a good bet. The biggest question, she argued, was what proportion of the Australian film industry would be in a financial position to make movies again once the worst of the pandemic is over. ""The thing that none of us know is how long it will take,"" Ms Smith said. ""I don't think any of us have ever experienced a crisis like this."" Screen Australia chief executive Graeme Mason agreed audiences would likely want ""broader-playing"" films after the shutdown. ""I'd be thinking there'll be more things like Priscilla [Queen of the Desert] and Strictly Ballroom for a period,"" he said. ""It would be foolish to not think that people will not want slightly broader-playing things for a period of time, particularly in Australia where we've had the drought, bushfires, and now COVID-19.""   Mr Mason said filmmakers were in the process of ""working out how to keep going"" and what government support might be available to them, like many Australian workers and businessowners during the COVID-19 shutdown. ""They're looking at what they can do for themselves and what they've got on and what federal and state moneys are available to them, I think everybody will be just working out how to keep going,"" Mr Mason said. ""We're looking at ways to support them to get something from state and federal grants and how can we help them get going again when this over."" Screen Australia last week announced it would more than double funding for its high-budget story development grants program. Other government film agencies are also offering support, including the South Australian Film Corporation, which will fund business resilience training for freelance cast and crew, and look to establish connections with universities to encourage paid guest lecturing opportunities.   Another Sydney-based producer, Rosemary Blight (The Sapphires, Invisible Man) said she was not deliberately pivoting away from violent films because of coronavirus; rather, she was focusing on films that would allow viewers to ""escape"" their realities. ""People want great, dramatic stories … to escape into [another] world,"" she said. ""Whether that world is a feel-good world or … it's a world that scares the hell out of you … people will want engrossing stories. ""We're looking at a slate that's quite an eclectic [mix of genres].""   Melbourne-based long-time executive producer and film lawyer Bryce Menzies (Ten Canoes, Muriel's Wedding, Red Dog) said that, with the advent of major streaming services like Netflix, Australian films had to be ""extraordinary … out of the box"" productions to make it to cinemas in the first place — no matter which genre they occupy. ""Because your standard fare is available on Netflix, people will not go to the cinema … unless it's remarkable,"" he said. ""Going to the cinema isn't enough — [the film] has to be an experience. ""Films have to be extraordinary, one way or the other.""   Mr White said films that appeal to older woman — a demographic that traditionally frequents specialist cinemas in high numbers — would do particularly well in a post-shutdown world. ""I'm confident that the person with the next [the Best Exotic] Marigold Hotel will really find a willing audience … determined to uplift themselves out of a fairly traumatic period,"" he said. However he said it was unclear how long it might take for them to return to the cinema, since older people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 — and some smaller cinemas were unlikely to survive. Meanwhile younger audiences, Mr White said, were displaying ""an insatiable appetite for really smart, engaging drama of a serious nature"" and watching it on streaming services. But that demographic was ""not really going to the cinema except for the latest Marvel or DC movie"".   Mr White stressed that although he expected a pivot to more feel-good cinema in coming months, that did not mean horror films and psychological thrillers would not be made — because they are especially well-received internationally. ""You'll not see those types of films disappear … they absolutely have commercial application beyond these shores,"" Mr White said. He concluded that although the Australian film industry would inevitably ""contract"" during the coronavirus crisis, it would also adapt and survive. ""It's a challenge that we've got to meet,"" he said. ""I'm actually optimistic … the people who are talented and dedicated will ride through this.""    ",By Bension Siebert,"April 08, 2020"

Thousands more are immersing ourselves in epic installations at the Biennale of Sydney or experiencing a sensory overload at QAGOMA's Water exhibition in Brisbane. Instead, these venues and festivals — alongside hundreds more, nationwide — have shut up shop, many for the first time in their operational history. As for us, we're cooped up like barnyard hens, socially distanced and self-isolated from one another.    Still, the arts haven't gone anywhere. In fact, we rely on them perhaps more than ever. Streaming TV and movies, video games, books and music all keep us sane and entertained, providing reprieve from the rolling horror of the news.  The only thing missing is the ability to experience all this together, alongside each other. However, Australian arts companies and organisations are stepping up, offering alternatives that make them accessible from home — or at least offering suggestions on how to help ensure their survival on the other side of COVID-19. Here are some of them.  This year's Biennale of Sydney — titled Nirin (meaning 'edge' in Wiradjuri) — is migrating online as of this week. In coming weeks, they say they'll be offering virtual walk-throughs and 360-degree tours via the Google Arts & Culture platform. In the meantime: head to their Instagram to catch up on curator-led tours through the different Biennale venues; and keep an eye on their YouTube for new content (which currently includes a look at Tony Albert's outdoor 'greenhouse' on Cockatoo Island).   The National Gallery of Victoria has launched immersive virtual tours of its exhibitions: you can currently 'walk' through the their blockbuster (and normally ticketed) exhibitions Keith Haring | Jean Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines (and listen to the audio guide at the same time) and Kaws: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness. Bendigo Art Gallery have created an online version of their exhibition Bessie Davidson and Sally Smart: Two artists and the Parisian avant-garde. The exhibition, which was open for just one day before the gallery had to close, features more than 50 paintings by lesser-known Australian Impressionist Bessie Davidson, who found success in 19th-century Paris, alongside works by her great-niece: renowned Australian artist Sally Smart.   Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA) are using their YouTube channel to showcase conversations with artists, in-depth looks into collections and hypnotic time-lapses of large-scale installations being built.  Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) might be closed, but Tim — a former tattoo-parlour manager turned living sculpture — is live-streaming his endurance performance in the empty gallery from 10:00am-4.30pm daily. Many art gallery stores are also still open online. Support your favourite gallery by buying gifts for others and yourself. For what it's worth, MONA is doing its bit by continuing to sell its infamous yet beloved vulva-shaped soap online — finally bring together art and hygiene.   Most cinemas are offering customers full refunds on any unused tickets. In the meantime, purchasing gift cards and cinema memberships for future use will help ensure they can be operational in a post-coronavirus world. While we're temporarily deprived of new releases on the big screen, Australia is lucky to have more streaming services available than ever. Netflix, Stan, Foxtel, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Disney Plus — as well as specialist services like DocPlay (documentaries), Hayu (reality TV) and Kayo (sports) — all require subscriptions.    On the other hand, ABC iView, SBS On Demand and commercial TV catch-up services cost nothing. And anyone with an Australian library account has access to Beamafilm and Kanopy, which offer a range of top-quality recent release movies and TV shows. Recent releases on Kanopy right now include Carol, Room, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and I Am Not Your Negro.  (Though public libraries are closed, here are ways to get the most out of your membership.) For Australian musicians working in an industry already gutted by illegal pirating and paltry shares offered by streaming services, playing live shows was often the last reliable source of income. For performers, tour managers, venue operators and crew alike, the closure of venues has now obliterated that revenue stream too. The industry's response? Isol-Aid music festival, which sees Australian musicians play music from home studios and bedrooms each weekend on Instagram. The sets raise money and awareness for Support Act — a charity supporting music workers impacted by Covid-19 (and was already supporting music workers affected by bushfires).   Find out which artists are scheduled via their Instagram account, hop onto the artist's Instagram at the scheduled time, and tune into the likes of Sarah Blasko, Courtney Barnett, Campcope and Montaigne playing intimate sets. And then, of course, donate to Support Act.  A special ""lunchtime"" edition of the festival — Isol-Aid: Lunch Without Borders — will be streaming from their Instagram this Wednesday from 11:30am to 1:30pm — featuring 15-minute sets from five artists, including Gordi, Asgeir, Julien Baker and Of Monsters And Men's Nanna Bryndis Hilmarsdottir. (Also consider paying for downloads of songs and albums instead of relying on Spotify and Apple Music. Direct downloads from Bandcamp allows artists to retain money. One recent fundraiser on the platform saw over $7 million AUD worth of music and merch sold, with profits retained by musicians. Better yet: order vinyl if available and support local record stores in the process.) With 640 shows scheduled, MICF 2020 was set to break records over its scheduled three-and-a-half week festival. Instead, it's making history for more sombre reasons. MICF's cancellation has also meant hundreds of other comedy shows across Australia have also been cancelled.   This Sunday (April 12), the ABC brings the festival into homes with a special Comedy Care Package at 8:20pm. Hosted by Denise Scott, the special will showcase the best of past MICF Galas, featuring festival favourites Aaron Chen, Anne Edmonds, Becky Lucas, Cal Wilson, Dave Hughes, Frank Woodley, Kitty Flanagan, Nazeem Hussain, Steph Tisdell, Tom Gleeson and Urzila Carlson. If you're not following your favourite comedians on social media already, now's a great time to discover what podcasts or video content they're producing. Judith Lucy's Overwhelmed and Dying (aren't we all?) podcast couldn't be more relevant or timely.  ABC Comedy has a dedicated TV station (Channel 22) and iView channel. Stan, Netflix and Amazon Prime have their own existing or upcoming Australian comedy specials to mine, including Zoë Coombs Marr's acclaimed stand-up show Bossy Bottom (available on Amazon Prime from April 10).  Punters can also make tax deductible donations to MICF to ensure the festival's survival. Ticket holders can also donate the value of their purchased tickets to the artist they were going to see, or email box office to arrange for a percentage of the sale to be retained. Follow MICF's Twitter and Facebook accounts to see daily mini-sets from previous festivals.

While Sydney Dance Company is unable to perform for audiences, it earns substantial revenue through its dance classes. Unlimited dance classes are available for $28 a week through their virtual studio. Smaller dance companies and studios also offer similar classes.

Sydney Chamber Opera was able to film their new production of Breaking Glass (in front of an audience-free theatre): four new one-act mini-operas composed by emerging female composers Peggy Polias, Josephine Macken, Georgia Scott and Bree van Reyk — all of which will be streamed soon. Having had to stop its popular live-stream concerts, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is now offering a new performance from its archives every Thursday night at 7:30pm via YouTube. Thursday April 9 you can catch Sir Andrew Davis' Grammy-nominated arrangement of Handel's Messiah (the ultimate Easter banger). The Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) has launched ACO HomeCasts, an extensive and innovative digital content season that will bring the music and musicians of the ACO directly into Australian homes.  Like musicians, authors tour the country with every book release, relying on a network of bookshop events and writers' festivals to ensure their work is properly promoted. The absence of festivals and bookshop storefronts now threaten the livelihoods of writers across the country.  While major writers festivals like the Sydney Writers Festival have had to cancel completely, the Newcastle Writers Festival went ahead — completely online — this past weekend, and the 2020 sessions are available on their YouTube channel. Many local bookshops are still forging ahead with author events via video on Zoom or Facebook, where you can be even more intimate with authors and ask them questions via webcam or in the comments.  Many local independent bookshops — such as Avid Reader in Brisbane, Better Read Than Dead in Sydney and Readings in Melbourne — now also offer free delivery within certain postcodes, with staff delivering purchases to your door via bike and foot. Head to the Australian Independent Bookseller website, pop in your postcode and you'll see shops nearest to you.  Australia's most recognisable built structure, and premier home of the arts, has been forced to shut up shop. In response, the Sydney Opera House has launched From Our House to Yours. Every Wednesday to Sunday night at 6:00pm, the Opera House will release archival footage, live broadcasts and even premieres.    This coming week features an author talk with bestselling children's book author (and actor/comedian) David Walliams (Wednesday April 8, 10:00am); a conversation between Clementine Ford and Flex Mami recorded at All About Women 2020 (Thursday April 9, 8:00pm); a live set from Panda Bear — aka Animal Collective co-founder Noah Lennox (Friday April 10, 8:00pm); author and philosopher Alain de Botton discussing On Love (Saturday April 11, 8:00pm) and the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs' performance of Handel's Messiah — performed in Auslan (Sunday April 12, 10:00am). As featured on Australian Story, Astrid Jorgensen's Pub Choir has connected Australians in large live spaces across the country, redefining what choirs can be.    Now they can no longer meet up in person, Pub Choir has gone online, reinvented itself as a Couch Choir, and asked participants to submit their individual parts from self-isolation. A video editor then stitches the parts together to glorious results.  In less than a week, their version of Close to You was viewed over 300,000 times, with over 1,000 people from 18 countries participating. We defy you not to cry while watching and thinking of loved ones you miss. ",ABC Arts      By Benjamin Law for Stop Everything! with Dee Jefferson,"April 08, 2020"
12,/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-tasmania-struggling-art-sector-adapting/12125686,Megan was in Paris on an arts residency when coronavirus hit. Now she's reimagining her project from home in Tasmania,"Artist Megan Walch was just two weeks into a months-long arts residency in the heart of Paris when coronavirus took hold of France.   ""Everything was closing in Paris like a series of dominoes,"" she said. ""I got to some of the key places I wanted to go to, and I ended up wandering the empty streets of Paris for two days with a camera, documenting what to me was an extraordinary time in that city. ""It was exhilarating and frightening, and it would oscillate between utter exhilaration and being quite nervous,"" she said. When France announced a nationwide lockdown, including the closure of all non-essential public locations, Walch faced being quarantined in her studio, away from family in a foreign country.   ""It wasn't the Paris I went there to work with and being forcibly removed from my family was not a good idea,"" she said. ""It wasn't until I physically boarded the plane that I thought I would get home.""   Upon her return, the painter spent two weeks in quarantine in her Hobart studio where she used her time to devise how best to continue with her original project — reimagining 18th century murals which depicted the French aristocracy as monkeys as contemporary wallpaper. Being able to examine the murals in detail was important to the self-described visual learner. ""It is a question as to whether [the project] can be digitally translated or how, if at all,"" Walch said. It is a problem facing artists everywhere in the time of coronavirus: how best to reimagine and display their work. Tasmania's Government last month announced $1.5 million in new funding for artists and arts organisations whose work was cancelled, postponed or disrupted due to COVID-19.    This included the $500,000 Arts and Screen Digital Production Fund, aimed specifically at artists like Walch. With a month before submissions close, three artists or arts organisations have already applied for funding under that program, while a further 22 applications are in progress.  State Growth deputy secretary of cultural and tourism industry development Jacqui Allen said the criteria were deliberately flexible to allow for innovation and collaboration. ""I think we needed some good news, to be honest,"" Ms Allen said, acknowledging the devastating impact of the coronavirus on Tasmania's broad arts community. ""We know Tasmania's creative and cultural profile is really important for people here. ""It's important for us to be sharing out stories, but it's also going to be part of our strategy to get people to come back and visit Tasmania."" Award-winning actress Marta Dusseldorp and acclaimed director husband Ben Winspear imagine a Tasmania where theatre is performed every night of the week. Archipelago Productions, their stage and screen company, was among three groups scheduled to open Hobart's new Studio Theatre with Angus Cerini's play, The Bleeding Tree.   While the coronavirus pandemic has put this on hold, the pair said their company was pressing on with rehearsals by using Zoom to do readings and analysis, while taking time to recalibrate. ""I actually think it's a really, really good time to inject a whole lots of funds into development because no-one's shooting at the moment,"" Dusseldorp said. ""So a lot of that money can be rerouted until the next financial year and really look to nurturing our writers, our creative minds, and get new works written. ""That's a positive."" ""A lot of the artists we've employed are really part-time, casuals, contract workers. They are very susceptible to falling through the cracks. Funding projects can really help address that,"" Winspear a former resident director with the Sydney Theatre Company, said. Staff at the acclaimed Big hART arts organisation, founded in Tasmania's north-west and focused on working with disadvantaged communities, have agreed to pay parity to ensure the company's survival.   All 20 employees are now paid just above the Government's JobKeeper subsidy of $1,500 per fortnight. According to co-founder and artistic director Scott Rankin, ""it's brought some people who are part-time up a bit and quite a lot of us down"". But it means Big hART will survive until at least October, a relief for a group which usually thinks in weeks instead of months when it comes to viability. ""It's okay maybe with [bigger companies] to [say] 'OK, we'll take a bit of a holiday or lay people off', but if you work in very disadvantaged communities you have to be very careful with the way you treat participants in the projects,"" Rankin said. ""In the end we can't be part of another failure in the life of our constituents or the cohort we work with."" Rankin said Big hART would also look to apply for various grants, but said more action from government was needed. ""If you listen to a podcast for a mental health, if you listen to music, if you get up and listen to Fran Kelly on the radio, if you put your feet on the floor and there's a handmade rug, if you reach for a ceramic mug … that's art, that culture is the lifeblood of who we are, it is us,"" Rankin said. ""The people we entrust to ensure our children and grandchildren have great experiences and express themselves and have a sense of agency and empowerment, that is the work of the arts.""   Walch described the State Government's funding as a much-needed ""care package"" for Tasmania's arts sector and said she hoped to work with local company MadFinch Productions to tell the story of organisations affected by coronavirus. ""A lot of artists are working on low incomes, no incomes, and it's going to wipe out a lot of practitioners,"" she said. ""Artists are also fantastic at creative problem-solving, so if people can creative problem solve and embed their practices in other forms or function in Australia — easier said than done — that would be an ultimate goal.  ""Artists are marginalised as luxury goods in Australia, they're seen as superfluous, so maybe this is a huge recalibration for all of society.""",By Emily Baker,"April 07, 2020"
13,/news/2020-04-07/what-is-quibi-is-it-available-in-australia-a-shortcut-guide/12037942,What is Quibi? Is it coming to Australia? Here's your shortcut guide,"Just when you thought you had watched everything on Netflix while in isolation, a new streaming service has just launched in the US. It's called Quibi and it focuses on short videos for your smartphone. Here's your shortcut guide. It's actually pronounced KWIH-bee and stands for ""quick bites"" of video. Debatable. Quibi is entering an increasingly crowded market of subscription streaming video services including the dominant Netflix, fast-rising Disney+ and other players including Amazon Prime, Apple TV+ and HBO Max. In Australia, there is also Stan and iView among others.  But Quibi CEO Meg Whitman has hinted that offering more variety when people are stuck at home could be a very welcome thing. She told the New York Times: ""Think about how often you use your phone when you're homebound. People who are home with their children would really like a 10-minute break."" Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said people might be inclined to fire up his product ""in between home schooling or doing chores around the house, or answering emails and being on video chats."" Ms Whitman said the company would now take ""some time to work out the kinks"" after deciding to push ahead with the launch. Movies, shows and other short-form videos specifically made for watching on a phone. Whether you hold the phone sideways or upright, you'll be able to watch in full screen.   This feature means filmmakers deliver two edits — one horizontal, one vertical — and Quibi stitches them together with one audio track. The other key feature is that episodes are only 10 minutes long (you know, to appeal to those impatient, distracted millennials). The start-up behind Quibi is founded by former Disney studios chief and DreamWorks co-founder Mr Katzenberg and has backing from all the major movie studios and entertainment companies. Ms Whitman, who we mentioned earlier, has headed companies such as eBay and HP. At least $US1 billion has been invested in programming. Some of its headliner shows star the likes of:    Chrissy's Court: Think Judge Judy, but with Chrissy Teigen (who's not a real judge). Survive: It's kind of like Lost. There's a plane crash and two passengers survive (one of them is Sophie Turner). They have to work together to make it out of the icy wilderness they're trapped in. Elba vs Block: Actor Idris Elba and precision driver Ken Block go head-to-head in a series of car stunt challenges. That's just a few of what's on offer. The LA Times described it as like the love child of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but there's a bit of scepticism over whether people will pay for watching short videos on a phone.  EMarketer forecasting analyst Eric Haggstrom told Reuters there were ""really good reasons to be sceptical"". For one, it's unclear if people will pay for short videos they can only watch on their phones, Mr Haggstrom said.  The younger audience that Quibi is targeting already consumes short-form entertainment for free on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. ""Quibi is a giant experiment,"" Mr Haggstrom said. Mr Katzenberg said Quibi represented the first time ""professional storytellers"" had tackled the problem of delivering a high-quality viewing experience on mobile. Yep. In 2015, Verizon created a mobile-first entertainment service called Go90, but it was ultimately cancelled after three years. $US5 a month, or $US8 for the ad-free version.  That's on par with Apple TV+ which costs $US5 per month, and undercuts Disney+'s $US6.99 per month and Netflix's most-popular $US13-per-month plan.  There has also been some scepticism about whether people will be prepared to pay for another service during a looming global recession. ""We've been planning this now for a year, more than a year,"" Mr Katzenberg said. ""Obviously we had no idea what we would be facing."" In a nod to consumers who are ""in distress"", he said the company is offering the first 90 days free. ""We are well enough financed to be able to afford to do that."" TBC.

14,/news/2020-04-07/nursing-home-resident-sewing-face-masks-to-fight-coronavirus/12125108,"Adelaide nursing home resident, 86, sewing face masks to support fight against coronavirus","Rina Sartoretto learnt to sew as a 12-year-old in Italy, and it's a trade she's still using 75 years later from a locked-down nursing home in Adelaide to support the fight against COVID-19.   ""Too bloody long,"" is the response when Mrs Sartoretto is asked how long she's been sewing for. ""I always loved sewing and I started back home in Italy, you know those years [there] was no overlocker, no electric machine like I've got now."" A dressmaker by trade, Mrs Sartoretto took her sewing machine with her when she moved into a western suburbs nursing home, along with her overlocker and a chest full of odds and ends of material collected over the years. That collection is now being turned into much-needed protective equipment.   ""The girl in charge here, she come in my room and said, 'Oh, Rina, that is a pretty material'. It's 20 years old, the material,"" Mrs Sartoretto said. ""She said, make some masks because these are hard to get now, the little masks, especially the washable ones.""   The 86-year-old said she's been offered $5 for a mask, but she doesn't want the money. ""First of all it's given me an interest to do something,"" she said. That's particularly important now, with visitors locked out of nursing homes. ""Before there used to be some people come for a bit of a show, some singing or something,"" Mrs Sartoretto said. ""Some school children used to come but now nobody can come in so now we are restricted to just a little bit of bingo."" Mrs Sartoretto's son Bruno can now only contact his mother via phone conversations. ""They locked her nursing home a week ago now. My last opportunity to meet her was Sunday week ago,"" he said. ""She's really missing her great-grand-kids, that's the biggest hurdle that we're finding that needs to be overcome.""   But he said she's resilient, like many from the generation that lived through war and the subsequent global upheaval. ""[I was] talking with her about all the toilet paper scenarios and she said, 'what toilet paper? We were lucky to see paper!',"" he said. ""Living through a world war and coming to Australia, that whole story, certainly you build up the resilience."" Mrs Sartoretto said she was looking forward to a return to the days when her children could take her on holidays, or home for meals on the weekend.   ""It's a big worry and very sad and who knows where it will end up because it seems to be spreading and spreading. A very, very sad situation,"" she said. ""In the meantime I'm going all the time making these little masks."" Current Australian advice is that face mask use should be limited to health workers and people who have coronavirus. But new research, showing widespread mask wearing can protect the community, may change that. And with global shortages of protective equipment, washable masks may be the only option for the general public.  ",By Leah MacLennan,"April 07, 2020"
15,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-shifts-consumer-behaviour-and-helps-businesses-boom/12119508,Coronavirus shifts consumer behaviour and helps some businesses boom,"Social distancing measures and shutdowns introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic have forced everyone to rethink their everyday interactions. It may permanently change the we live and work, according to Australian business leaders.   Teleconferencing services like Zoom and Skype, food delivery services like Uber Eats and Deliveroo, and bricks and mortar businesses like Bunnings now see the future differently. They are a few of the fortunate businesses that have not just survived the biggest health and economic catastrophe of the century, but are booming. However, the crisis has also raised new questions about privacy and security. If more of us are online and using apps to do everything from birthday parties, weddings and funerals to high-level business board meetings and cabinet discussions, what responsibilities do companies have to protect our information?   This is a question that Zoom, which reports a big uptick in usage of its free video conferencing app, has had to answer in recent weeks. After some cases of so-called ""Zoombombing"" — where hackers or trolls hijack a public video call — the company's security and privacy protections have come under heavy scrutiny, including in its home country where the New York Attorney-General is running an investigation.   Zoom's head of APAC, Michael Chetner, says the company takes its security and privacy obligations seriously, and ""we comply with all the local laws of the jurisdictions we operate in"". But he agrees that as use of the app — and thereby scrutiny — increases, how the company treats and communicates these issues takes on a new meaning. ""Scrutiny will increase, and we have to make sure everyone's comfortable with our rigorous security and privacy policies in place,"" he told ABC News. ""If that means better communicating it then we have to continue communicating it for sure.""   Mr Chetner says videoconferencing never been accessed as it is now. Technology is now a requirement, not a wish list. ""This is the biggest remote working experiment that the world has ever seen,"" he said. He noted recent cases of Italians using Zoom to conduct a wedding, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern using the platform to pull together a cabinet meeting, and even senators in Brazil using it to vote on legislation. ""We're forcing elements of digital transformation to happen,"" he said.   In Australia there has been more demand for services in rural and regional areas and around education and health. Mr Chetner says once there is more widespread use — with educators teaching their students and health professionals using the medium to deliver e-health services — ""the increase will be exponential"". ""It's still very early to tell whether that free user growth is going to turn into paying customers,"" he said, but noted in time that could happen. ""As of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, conducted on Zoom was about 10 million. ""In March this year, we reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid."" The introduction of social distancing measures and related closures of businesses has hit the cafe and restaurant sector especially hard.   But companies like UberEats and Deliveroo — which for some time have faced heavy opposition from bricks and mortar businesses for not paying the industry enough of a cut — are now seeing droves of temporarily shut-down restaurants move onto their platform. Deliveroo chief executive Ed McManus said in the week after bans were introduced, the company saw an additional 1,700 restaurants come onto their platform. This includes higher-end restaurants, and those which in the non-coronavirus-period typically had long lines of customers waiting outside their doors, such as Melbourne's Chin Chin. Mr McManus says there has also been growth in the number of new consumers ordering through the app, as well as in the volume of deliveries. ""The restaurant and café business is open for delivery,"" he said. ""We have seen steady growth over past few weeks particularly in lunchtime demand."" He says coronavirus does raise interesting questions about whether consumer behaviour is now forever changed across industries, especially in retailing. ""It depends how long this lasts,"" he said, but added Australians loved dining out with friends and family, and that would likely always be the case.   Uber Eats regional general manager Jodie Auster says the platform already has more than 20,000 restaurant partners to choose from. ""Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic we have witnessed an influx of new restaurants … looking for ways to increase their digital business,"" she said. Uber Eats has deployed staff from other parts of its business, including New Zealand, to meet this increased demand. 'Leave at door' contactless delivery is now available in all Australian cities. But while this is an ""unprecedented time for businesses across the world"", according to Ms Auster, once the crisis ends she expects Australians will return to dining out. ""Dining out has always been an important part of our lives, and will continue to be,"" she said. Chapel Street Precinct Association general manager Chrissie Maus said businesses have been forced to pivot to home delivery to survive this pandemic period, but were reluctantly using the online delivery platforms which charged ""sky-high commissions"". Mr McManus said, ""we do hear that message, but we're not in a position to reduce commissioners because if we did, we'd have to pay delivery riders less"". Will Davies, chief executive and co-founder of car sharing platform Car Next Door, said at one point last month their service was up 70 per cent compared to the same time last year. While demand has since dropped off, he says Australians are still using car sharing, especially people in the healthcare industry who are still travelling to and from work but don't have a car and don't want to use public transport.   The retail sector, however, may have permanently changed. Bunnings managing director Mike Schneider says the retailer has seen unprecedented demand for goods as more Australians work and spend time at home. ""We're adapting to new ways of living and working at the moment,"" he said.   Mr Schneider says there has been a huge wave of people purchasing supplies to build home offices and home classrooms. But there has also been steady strong demand for cleaning products, seedlings and general garden supplies including seedlings. The company's online marketplace has also been booming, with people purchasing gym equipment and various home fittings and furnishings. Mr Schneider said in March there were about 30 million visits to the Bunnings website. ""That's started to flow through to increased products purchased through the website,"" he said. The percentage of customers opting for online delivery also increased. ""It's often said it takes three months to build a new habit, and this seems to have legs,"" he said. ""Our patterns of living our going to change, and if that changes then what you buy and how you buy it changes. ""That presents a challenge for business to adapt. ""There's no doubt that the online retailing space will.""   Businesses that have already been operating online have been unexpected winners in this crisis. Kate Morris, founder of adorebeauty.com.au, says her Melbourne-based business has never seen such a leap in demand for online beauty and skincare products.   She expects they will hit over the budget target of $100 million turnover this year, thanks to a huge spike in demand for products including handwash, hand sanitiser and soap and skincare. ""Premium handwash sales are up 342 per cent,"" she said.   Since beauty salons closed and people stopped going to hairdressers because of stricter social distancing measures, Ms Morris says sales of shampoo and conditioners as well as ""feel-good"" items like face masks have also soared. ""We don't know how long this [sales boom] will go on for, but it's fair to say the jump has been somewhat dramatic,"" she said. ""There's a big uplift in new customers shopping with us for the first time. It's possible that they were shopping online somewhere else before or they are first-time online shoppers."" It's not just the beauty industry benefitting. Australian online bookstore Booktopia's deputy CEO and CTO Wayne Baskin says they are hitting their budget targets because demand for some books has gone up. ""We're seeing more than 100 per cent growth in fiction titles,"" he said, noting that sales of education textbooks had declined steeply. ""A lot of the universities have delayed their courses as international students aren't coming in anymore."" Since mid-March, following a ban on open home inspections and on-site auctions, there's been some growth in online auctions and livestreaming of auctions. Peter Gibbons runs Openn Negotiation, which operates pre-contracted auctions where bidders participate on an online platform. ""We have been absolutely inundated by [enquiries from] agents since coronavirus,"" he said. ""We currently have over 200 live auctions in process … with 231 new trained agents in the past couple of weeks.""   David Scholes, the founder of another online bidding platform called SoldOnline, also reports more real estate agents are enquiring about using the platform. He describes SoldOnline as ""the eBay for property sales"", where the vendor typically pays a $399 fee to join up and buyers make real-time virtual bids for properties through a registered portal. Agents are watching what bidders are doing and can talk to them by phone or through a chat bot. In the online world, it is still entirely up to the agent to ensure people are not engaging in fake bidding. ""Since the Prime Minister's announcement, SoldOnline is also working closely with 35 individual agencies to switch to online auctions, with one agency already listing 16 properties with the online platform,"" he said. ""The first coronavirus-impacted auction went ahead last week, and it achieved $13,000 over reserve. ""We have seen enquires go through the roof — in the past week I estimate I have fielded about 150 phone calls from real estate agents."" He says not all of these phone calls translated to agents moving onto the platform. Some agents still prefer to use livestreaming options over an online bidding site. Brendan Condon, chief executive of Melbourne-based urban farming company Biofilta, has already seen people's living habits change. His business offers a ""Foodcube"" that allows communities to produce large volumes of fresh food in small city spaces including backyards, carparks and rooftops.   Mr Condon said since coronavirus, Biofilta had more than doubled the number of Foodcubes it sells each month from 150 to 300. He says each module grows around 25 kilograms of fresh produce annually and the average order is between five to 10 food cubes with soil. ""That's enough for 125 kilograms to 250 kilograms of fresh produce,"" he said. ""We will see lasting change [in how people behave] as we move through this period."" But it is not just consumer habits changing. Small businesses are also adapting. Suzi Jamil is the owner and director of Think Inc, an events touring company that has in the past brought international speakers including Jane Goodall and Richard Dawkins to Australia. She said the company used to charge about $70 to $80 a ticket for people to see live events at places like the Sydney Opera House. Now, she's moved the events online and charges about $10 to $20 a ticket. Online audiences can still engage with the star of the show in real-time, with a live Q&A, and chance to do online networking after the event. ""This is a major shift [in how people behave],"" she said. ""It is teaching people to link up online. And as a small business owner based in Sydney, I can reach a global demographic.""

16,/news/2020-04-05/evolution-of-church-when-the-congregation-is-gone/12060542,Beyond the church: How Australia's sacred spaces are evolving,"What is church? Most people would identify stone walls, crosses, stained-glass windows, a place of worship and refuge or obligatory Sunday services.   Churches hold a long-lasting life and place in Australia's culture, but increasing numbers of them are no longer used for their original purpose. If Australians are not worshipping in them, they are eating in them, marrying in them, or exercising in them. Whatever ties we have to faith, churches remain a part of Australian life and community. Religion historian and University of Sydney professor Carole Cusack, said it was in the 19th century that churches began popping up everywhere. ""Once the transportation of convicts became less and people came as free settlers to a land of opportunity, there was a massive burst of church building,"" Dr Cusack said. Fast-forward to the era of the Beatles and some started to disappear. ""There has been considerable decline in church attendance since about 1960 and a lot of churches have become redundant,"" Dr Cusack said. ""They get deconsecrated. They're made into different things."" While the decision to buy and reinvent a church space might be a no-brainer to some, Dr Cusack said others were less sure.  ""People have mixed feelings about that sort of thing. They think that that's kind of a profane destiny for a building that was intended as sacred.""   So how do investors and business owners feel about occupying these spaces without putting on a Sunday service? When real-estate photographer Adrian Gale photographed Naracoorte's Church of Christ he had no idea he would buy it a year later. While in love with its natural lighting and ancient walls, something more urged his interest. ""I just love the story of it,"" Mr Gale said  The church was built in 1906.  When the congregation outgrew the small hall, they built a kids' ministry and supper hall on the back. When they outgrew that, they moved. The building has been a practice room for the town band, a Seventh Day Adventist Church and a funeral business. ""Most Naracoorte people have probably been to a funeral there in the past 20 years,"" Mr Gale said. As well as his photography base, Mr Gale lends the space to other community events like yoga, baby showers and wedding ceremonies — something he feels is his responsibility.   ""Churches themselves in history have been so involved in supporting communities and being a part of communities,"" he said. ""We're able to keep a space in the community in a whole different way."" It is a feeling that is also felt 50 kilometres down the road at Erica Bowen's restaurant in Penola. For Ms Bowen and her husband, the Methodist church they made into a home for their business had ""a good feel about it"". Like Mr Gale, she has familiarised herself with the church's history — information that has not gone to waste. She said the coupler were often asked about the building's origins.   Then there are the people that know the space well, like the Irish dancers that used to practise there. ""People come with their own stories on top of what we are … which is pretty cool,"" Ms Bowen said. ""Breathing life into something that's old to make it new again always has a good story to it.""  Mr Gale explained the opportunity as one of stewardship, not ownership.    ""When a building's 110 years old ,you don't really own a building like that, you're more a steward of it for the season that you own it,"" Mr Gale said.  Even before coronavirus shifted things, many churches were gathering online — as well as meeting in gyms, shopfronts and homes. ""It's an idea [that] to be a Christian you don't have to go anywhere special to do anything special,"" Dr Cusack said.   Dave Shepherd leads Hills Baptist Verdun campus from a school gym in the Adelaide Hills. ""We love the gym … It's very real and authentic and non-religious,"" he said. He admitted it was not as comfortable and definitely more work. ""It requires a huge number of people to put in a huge amount of effort,"" he said. ""But that builds community and a sense of authenticity and I think that's been the great strength."" While many have loved the unconventional space, it has not been for everyone.   ""We had a couple of people who came and basically said 'I just can't worship in a gym',"" Mr Shepherd said. While opting for non-traditional worshipping venues is increasingly common for certain denominations, Dr Cusack said it was unheard of for others, like the Catholic and Anglican church. While places of worship may be something these denominations differ on, Mr Shepherd said the universal need for congregations to go online had been beneficial. ""Missionally it's the best thing that has happened to the Western church in a very, very long time,"" Mr Shepherd said. Even though people are not walking through the doors of a church, Mr Shepherd said services on social media were attracting new people. ""[People] are sitting doing nothing and the [services are] popping up and they're listening, and that's what we're seeing,"" Mr Shepherd said. ""It's an exciting time for the church to stand up and pivot and do something different.""",ABC South East SA      By Bec Whetham,"April 05, 2020"

But artists work in a 'grey area' — and worry about the future ,"Melbourne's colourful street art entices thousands of tourists into laneways every day, keen to experience the city's culture and snap the perfect photo. But many of the people behind the art are concerned about the city's creative future. Street artists work in a ""grey area"" — their work is spruiked as a tourist destination by the city council, but it's still illegal, even in iconic hotspots like Hosier Lane and AC/DC Lane. ""Hosier Lane is the number one free tourist attraction in Australia,"" artist and Blender Studios director Adrian Doyle says. More than 1 million visitors visit the lane each year.   ""That's huge. It's similar to the amount of people going to the Great Ocean Road,"" Doyle says. ""If that was any other thing they'd be building toilets and shops."" He says Melbourne City Council is caught in the middle on the issue —  it wants the economic benefits the tourists, but also has to acknowledge the law. ""Some of it they like and some of it they don't. And that's clearly the different between street art and graffiti,"" Doyle says. Debate about the laneways — and the line between art and vandalism — intensified in February, after Hosier Lane was ""paint bombed"" using fire extinguishers. Paint was sprayed over most of the murals and across the iconic cobbled bluestone road.   Doyle describes it as ""act of vandalism"" which was ""brutal but kind"". News headlines called the group ""guerrilla painters"", and some questioned whether the city's street art ""freedom"" was ""luring more graffiti vandals"". Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp said although the laneway art was ""forever changing"", the group's actions were ""not in keeping with the spirit of Hosier Lane"".  Victoria Police is still investigating the incident, which it called an ""attack on the street art"". Both the council and police take the view that street art in the laneways is ""legal"" provided the artist has ""proper permission"" before picking up their spray can.   Lukas Kasper, who had two pieces in the laneway before the paint bombing, doesn't have any problem with ""paint going over paint"". ""If there's going to be a space to do a huge project like this, shouldn't it be the socially acceptable, ever-changing painted walls of Hosier Lane?"" he says. But he says it exposes a problem for street artists who work in a legal ""grey area"". ""It's one of those things that's become just like a norm, but technically, there's actually no written laws that says this space is legal,"" Kasper says, while painting in the lane. ""High chances are if a police officer stopped in this laneway right now, nothing would happen. ""But in other paint-covered laneways I've had them take my paint, my details and moved me on."" Doyle, who runs an inner-city studio for street and fine art artists, says police use a ""tag bank"" to collate people's work, particularly graffiti artists. ""Once they've got one of the tags, they link it to all [your other] tags in the tag bank,"" he says.   While the ""graffiti world"" is different to street art, it's where many artists, including Doyle, begin their careers. ""I imagine if I had got caught then with the same penalties now, I wouldn't be running Blender ... because it would have destroyed my life,"" he says. After the paint bombing, he made an impassioned plea for artists to take back ""control of our creative city"" and cited fears about the gentrification of laneway culture and over-zealous police.   ""Someone called the police on my friend whom was painting in Flinders Court recently. And the police came, and my friend got in trouble for painting,"" he wrote. ""I know what we do is a grey area and it's a very divisive issue for local government. But it is crucial to the survival of the creative CBD and its urban culture.  ""How would it look if I sent a well-respected international artist to paint in Flinders Court ... and they were arrested? ""It's a bad look for Melbourne and terrible for Blender."" It was met by silence. ""It's funny. As soon as someone does something like that, everyone seems to care, but nobody wants to do anything,"" Doyle says.   He says Melbourne City Council ""doesn't know where to sit on it because it's illegal"". The council says it is considering Street Art Guidelines ""to assist street artists and provide clarity for all parties"". For Doyle, Hosier Lane and what artists are painting there has changed. ""A lot of the artwork in there is just like marriage proposals or adverts for stuff,"" he says. ""We all have to make a living, I understand that, but that sort of stuff shouldn't be in Hosier Lane.""   He fears the movement has lost its political punchiness. Doyle would like to see creativity — and politics — return to Hosier Lane, and the street art scene more broadly. He reminisces about the stencils and punchy political messages of the early 2000s and speculates that commercialisation is influencing what artists do. ""I think it's almost a picture competition [now] to see who can do the prettiest picture and for me, art needs to have a bit of a punch,"" he says. ""It's meant to make people feel a little bit awkward."" Street art researcher Lachlan MacDowall, from MIECAT Institute, says there is ""still a lot of really direct political work"" — like Peter Drew's Aussie poster campaign.   ""Artists are getting more interested in monetising their work and producing the career out of their work,"" Dr MacDowall adds. He says many are using laneway walls ""as a backdrop for the production of digital content"". ""Basically they're not even painting the wall primarily for the people who will walk in the laneways because there's a much larger audience who will access to the work on digital platforms,"" he says. Doyle is hopeful of a reinvention — he's seen it happen before. He knows the next generation of artists will find a way to keep it fresh. ""Everything in the whole world has gone through a meeting ... street art's not like that,"" he says. ""It's just some dude that just puts it up. There's no meetings and so in a way it's freeing. It's really democratic.""    ",ABC Radio National      By Sarah Scopelianos,"April 05, 2020"
18,/news/2020-04-05/adelaide-biennial-monster-theatres-australian-art-taps-into-fear/12118986,Australian artists tap into current fears and past nightmares in Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art,"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's gothic tale Rappacini's Daughter, a young scholar falls in love with the lonely, cloistered daughter of a scientist who specialises in plant-based poisons, only to discover that this young woman — Beatrice — is in fact one of her father's experiments, and has poisoned him by proximity. Beatrice has breath that kills, is deadly to the touch, and has a ""sister"" who is an equally poisonous purple-flowered plant. She is called monstrous by her erstwhile lover — but it's clear to the reader that she is the only really good and innocent character in Hawthorne's tale. Visitors to Adelaide Botanic Gardens in March were able to judge for themselves: Beatrice is currently in residence there, inside the Museum of Economic Botany — where (prior to the COVID-19 shutdown of galleries and museums) she was taking visitors. This Beatrice is plush and purple and tentacled — more creature than woman. Whether visitors found her compelling or repellent might be the subject of artist Julia Robinson's own experiment. The creature's tentacles are covered in lush silk, some of it shot through with iridescence — but this ""skin"" is patterned with small incisions, or gashes, through which nodules of incipient life bulge.   ""My vision of Beatrice is that she's this kind of metamorphic, loud, brash, birthing, splitting and hybridised creature that's trying to break the edges of her boundaries to sort of tease herself out of this mess,"" says Robinson. Beatrice is part of the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, one of more than 120 works by 25 artists presented in an edition themed ""Monster Theatres"", curated by the Art Gallery of South Australia's Leigh Robb. It marks the 30th anniversary of the nation's longest-running survey of Australian art. Robinson was reading a book on poisons when she came across a reference to Rappacini's Daughter.  At that point, Robb had already offered the Adelaide artist a spot within the Museum of Economic Botany — and she felt like serendipity put the idea in her path.  ""I was like 'Oh my God', because it describes Beatrice as this toxic plant-woman,"" Robinson recalls. The setting of the museum is more poignant the longer you look: monstrous and monstered Beatrice is hemmed in by glass cases full of pinned specimens — while just outside the museum, in the gardens, her botanical habitat awaits.   Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein before it, Rappacini's Daughter turns the tables on the reader to reveal that the monster is in fact the man who created the ""monstrous"" being.  That the doctors in both stories care more for science than humankind, and are guided by arrogance rather than compassion, reveals a lot about the era that both authors were writing in.  But more timelessly, these tales reveal the secret truth of monsters: that like beauty, they are in the eye of the beholder; what to one person is monstrous, to another is wonderful. And so this year's Adelaide Biennial becomes a kind of litmus test of our times — for it reveals what each artist, and each audience member, most fears, loathes or rejects (in her curator's essay, Leigh Robb points out that the Latin roots of ""monster"" are the words for ""to warn"" and ""to show""). Robb says she picked the artists before the theme: ""I'd [initially] looked at 10 artists that I wanted to see together, and that I saw as representing really vital strands in Australian contemporary art practice, and ones that had either defined Australian art history or were in the process of reshaping it through pivotal new work, and shapeshifting, interdisciplinary practices.""   She says that the work of this core group of artists revealed common interests and trends: artists using narrative, figuration (as opposed to abstraction) and immersion to sound warnings about, or simply probe, major sources of trauma and anxiety — climate change, colonisation, patriarchy, to name a few biggies. From there, she selected other artists and works that more explicitly fit her theme of ""Monster Theatres"".  The resulting line-up takes us through from pioneering performance artist Mike Parr to young polymath provocateur Abdul Abdullah; from LA and London-based artist Polly Borland (famous for her 90s photo series Adult Babies) to local hero Karla Dickens. This Biennial offers visitors Mike Bianco's quixotic, intimate experience of ""resting with bees"" in the Botanic Gardens, on the one hand, and the spectacular robot-sculpture of veteran performance and body artist Stelarc, on the other.    Some works position themselves in opposition to particular monsters: Hobart-based artist Willoh S. Weiland says ""patriarchy is the monster"", and has created a video tribute to the 300 women, most over the age of 50, who volunteer as guides at the Art Gallery of South Australia. She presents her work inside a curtained, single-person ""shrine"" within the gallery, inviting visitors to pay tribute to these under-recognised (and often ""invisible"") women who mediate many of our experiences with art in the gallery.    In the adjacent gallery space, Sydney artist Abdul Abdullah strikes out against the dynamics of exclusion, with Understudy: a spot-lit microphone on a small stage, with red curtains behind and seating rows in front — and one sole figure sitting expectantly, clothed in head-to-toe fake designer-wear, as if waiting for the main act. Visitors who venture to the front of this faux theatre will see that the figure is a human-primate hybrid with large moist eyes and a snubbed skull-shaped nose — an uneasy mix of endearing and grotesque. Abdullah's work is one of several that pitch their camp at the threshold between horror and wonder, and are made by artists who are subverting mainstream ideas of what is ""monstrous"" or deserving of rejection.   For Perth duo Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, the male-dominated cinema of ""body horror"" is ripe for an intervention: their short film Dark Water taps into tropes of the monstrous feminine, following a grieving young woman into a watery subterranean zone beneath her house, where her body is transformed or re-birthed. The horror in Dark Water draws from a real medical syndrome: when one twin dies in the womb, sometimes the survivor absorbs their body — and carries remnants of their deceased sibling within their body for life.  Dark Water is the third film Coates and Nazzari have made together, and the result of roughly four years of work (including an army of volunteers and an elaborate hand-built backyard aquatic set — from which Coates's lawn hasn't recovered). They spent months making the props, which include the fantastical aquatic lifeforms: ""evolved"" versions of species endemic to Western Australia's coastal waters.   All their work together centres around ideas of women and water — specifically, the mythologies and superstitions around the sea and sailors. They share an interest in the aesthetics of Australian gothic and ""eco horror"", and describe their work as ""oceanic gothic"". For Coates, an interest in the sea stems partly from growing up in the coastal town of Albany (a former whaling town), with a dad who is a diver; Nazzari, conversely, grew up in the landlocked, bone-dry mining town of Kalgoorlie, and developed a fascination with water from the perspective of scarcity. Their interest in horror, meanwhile, is harder to pin down — but Coates says: ""I think both of us — and we've talked about this before — have always had this interest in really looking at things closely, and not looking away. ""I remember as a child, if I saw a dead animal I'd always want to know what happened: How did it die? What did it look like inside? It was that sort of interest in biology; in the blood and guts of what's inside of me.""   They see Dark Water as reclaiming the unique female potential of horror — a genre that has historically been made by and for men. Nazzari says: ""A lot of why women are interested in horror is to do with education and protecting and preserving yourself … We will happily watch the woman holding her car keys and being scared, because in some ways we're thinking — how does that protect you?"" Coates chimes in: ""I think also, when they say that horror and the abject is this unfamiliarity with the insides of our bodies, and this rejection of it — I don't entirely agree with that. I think for women, we're actually not unfamiliar with the insides of our bodies. We bleed every month and we give birth."" Bad scientists and body horror don't just belong to fiction, of course — and one of the Biennial's most compelling works is inspired by a real-life Australian monster. In the Dead House, by Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu peoples), responds to Adelaide Botanic Gardens' dark history as a site where Scottish-born doctor and anthropologist William Ramsay Smith conducted experiments on the corpses of Aboriginal people and ""unclaimed"" bodies, in his position as Adelaide Coroner.    Ramsay Smith's own writings reveal he robbed graves for his collection; he also stole remains from Aboriginal burial grounds. After his death, 182 skulls were found in his home. ""He had this macabre interest in decapitating Aboriginal bodies and sending their remains internationally — mostly to the UK,"" says Scarce. ""Because he was the coroner, it's almost like he had free rein."" Scarce's installation occupies a small square brick building that was formerly a morgue attached to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Inside, 30 bulbous forms in translucent, cloudy glass are arranged in careful rows. Scarce explains that these are ""bush bananas"", endemic to central and western Australia.  Each bulb has been cut open, with the glass curling outwards from each wound, like skin. ""They've been cut open to represent that old way of dissecting bodies. It was really important to show that disrespect [with which Ramsay Smith treated the bodies] — the flaying of the bananas was done very roughly.""   The installation has the feeling of a memorial, and like a lot of Scarce's previous works, it deals with ""unnamed"" victims of historical violence.  Scarce was born in Woomera, South Australia, and has made work about the effects of 20th-century nuclear testing on the Kokatha people and members of her family. ""For me, it's really important that I make work that is about these types of stories,"" she says. The monsters in Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens' work are more abstract but no less real than William Ramsay Smith. Her Dickensian Country Show takes over an entire gallery space and turns it into a ""fun fair"" with a dark twist: there's a ""Colonial Roundabout"", and rides titled ""Live Stock"" and ""Warn a Brother"" — each of these repurposing vintage carnival rides to create sinister allusions.   Around the perimeter of the room, dense collage-work ""posters"" mash up 19th and 20th-century carnival and circus imagery with text to provocative effect: a nightmarish assemblage of monster masks sits alongside hand-written text reading ""True horror is Australia's history of massacring its first people"". Another poster shows Pauline Hanson in a clown nose and a blood-spattered ruff. A spoof of a ""palm reading"" poster reads: ""You don't need a third eye to see the planet's f*%ked."" Koalas are everywhere — lightening the mood, but also avatars for country and environment.  The effect of this maximalist gallery space is almost like a 3D collage. ""Why I love collage so much is that people come in here and it's triggering stuff in their memory,"" says Dickens.  ""Once people's memories are opened a little bit, then their hearts are a bit more engaged.""   A Dickensian Country Show takes as its springboard Australia's chequered Indigenous circus history — from 20th-century ""Wizard of Wire"" Con Colleano (who ""passed"" as Spanish during his career) to boxing tent champs like Jack Hassen and Jerry Jerome.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Indigenous Australians were kidnapped and forced to perform in circuses (including PT Barnum's Greatest Show on Earth), but over the ensuing decades, many of them adapted the form and made it their own — in some cases (like Colleano, who was world famous) turning it to their advantage. ""And the thing about circus too is that people were embraced — the misfits and the outcasts. Your colour or your disabilities were celebrated, not shunned,"" says Dickens. A Dickensian Country Show is a major work, and Dickens has created a counterpart titled A Dickensian Circus in the foyer of the Art Gallery of NSW, as part of the Biennale of Sydney. Work of this scale was only possible thanks to a $80,000 visual arts fellowship from the Copyright Agency, and funding from Create NSW. Next door to Karla Dickens' warped ""country show"" is an assemblage of rocks, rusted steel drums, wire and supersized drill bits that looks vaguely ominous — almost like an instrument of torture. In fact it's an instrument of sound, designed to be played by musicians using modified bows; the rocks are suspended by wires such that they produce different pitches (effectively, it's a very unwieldy string instrument).    Quandamooka artist Megan Cope conceived this instrument as a way to recreate the distinctive, eerie cry of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone curlew, which is often likened to the wailing of a woman or baby. It's a bird that is both native and thriving on her home of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) but endangered in New South Wales and Victoria. For Cope, colonisation, capitalism and our 'extraction mindset' are the monsters.  The seed of the idea for her Biennial work, which is titled Untitled (Death Song), was sown in an earlier sound work, from 2018, in which she built an instrument using rocks from the Newcastle region (the lands of the Awabakal people) ""to enable the elements of country to sing its story of change upon colonisation"".  The drill bits used in Untitled (Death Song) come from mining machinery; the rocks are from the South Australian Museum: ""They're millions of years old … [but] we overlook their knowledge,"" says the artist. When curator Leigh Robb approached Cope about being part of the Monster Theatres exhibition, the artist immediately knew she wanted to produce another sound work — ""because we're just so overstimulated, visually, these days — and we're not really listening to the warnings"". ""And I think there's a lot of warnings [to listen to],"" she adds.  ""In our culture we learn [to hear] those warnings through the process of listening — with your eyes and with your ears."" Cope's hope is that the musicians who play her instrument — who are asked to learn how to mimic the curlew call — are able to ""connect with these deeper concepts in the work, through that process of slowing down and focusing on the call of the bird"".

19,/news/2020-04-04/driveway-project-brings-fun-to-coronavirus-isolation/12114400,Driveway photoshoots of families having fun keep connections alive during COVID-19 isolation,"A driveway may not be the best backdrop for a photoshoot, but if you are a professional photographer the choices are limited as millions of Australians heed the Government's message to ""stay home"". Gold Coast based photographer Maja Szumylo is using it as an opportunity to connect with families who are socially isolating. ""I've been thinking about many different ways of how I can help with my skills … and I believe that we should stay connected somehow,"" she said. Ms Szumylo stumbled across #thedrivewayproject, where families are photographed in their driveways. It sparked the connection she was looking for and prompted her to offer free mini-shoots in an effort to create a positive outlook for the community. ""They [families] love it, they absolutely love it,"" she said. ""It's bringing back some of the joy into the times we are experiencing. And the families love the photos.""   Ms Szumylo came across the project from Darwin photographer Francesca Fuga. Ms Fuga said she was pretty down after learning everything was shutting down. ""It also meant that my work would not continue for the time being,"" she said. Like Ms Szumylo, she asked herself what could she do to bring the community together and have some fun. ""I thought that we could send really, really beautiful messages from people's driveways to make everybody feel like we are in this together,"" she said.   ""We're all in our homes, separate, but we are all going through the same. And if we keep positive it will be better for the outcome."" A birthday party, a family with their instruments, and even a boatful of family members are some of the creative ways Ms Fuga has captured people for the project. Ms Fuga said many photographers across the country had been in touch with her about replicating the project in their neighbourhoods. ""It's awesome, and it cheered me up as I'm also out of work,"" she said.     Ms Szumylo contacted Ms Fuga to thank her for what she was doing with the project. ""I think it's really awesome that we keep sharing ideas further and make this world a better place, wherever we can,"" she said. Safety is something Ms Szumylo is keeping front of mind while on a shoot. ""Obviously just keeping a distance, which is very hard to manage sometimes … but I use my zoom lens so I'm more than 10 metres away from them,"" she said.   ""I'm very safe. I do it once or twice a week, and I stay home all the rest of the time."" Ms Szumylo said in times like this it was easy to get carried away with fear and that we need to remind ourselves of who we truly are. ""You look at the photo and you remember who you are and who your family is,"" she said.    ",ABC Gold Coast      By Solua Middleton,"April 04, 2020"
20,/news/2020-04-04/dayne-beams-finding-peace-away-from-afl/12121616,Collingwood's Dayne Beams replacing AFL with art as he continues to deal with mental health issues,"In a time of uncertainty for the AFL community, Dayne Beams has found his clarity.   The Collingwood midfielder stepped away from football indefinitely in December 2019 to focus on his mental health. Four months later, Beams watched on as the coronavirus pandemic forced his fellow players away from the game — while he has experienced first-hand the pay cuts that have come with them. ""From my point of view and I guess from a lot of other players' point of view, our pay has been cut quite significantly,"" Beams said. ""[You're] just trying to reassess everything in terms of your budget and home loan repayments and any other repayments that you might have — like my rent at the factory I have … and just trying to adjust accordingly."" Beams worries the pandemic will contribute to mental health issues but hopes the season suspension will prompt players to explore their outside interests.     ""It's so important, I think, to have something outside your everyday job in life,"" Beams said. ""I know I struggled for a lot of years with not being able to have an outlet outside of football and at the moment you're forced to have some sort of outlet."" For Beams, art therapy became that outlet, when he ""stumbled across"" it while in a mental health facility last year. ""I just wasn't doing really well in my life and I went in with an attitude of just being open and being open-minded to give everything a go,"" he said. ""I received a program for the weeks I was there, and I looked at it and the two things that stood out to me on the page that I thought I wouldn't enjoy were actually yoga and art therapy. ""I scoffed at those things, I felt 'those are two things I'm not gonna enjoy' and they actually turned out to be the two things I enjoyed the most. ""While the yoga's fallen off a bit, my art, it's my purpose in life — I love it."" Art became Beams's escape — then his passion. He set up a website — Health of Mind Art — with a portion of the profits from his abstract art directed to mental health charity Love Me Love You. Now 30, Beams is eyeing life after footy in the mental health space.     He is enrolled in a counselling diploma and hopes to one day use his art factory as a therapy room. ""It is nice to have a direction, a clear picture on where you want to go in life — because footy's only a small part of your life,"" he said. ""I'm quite calm about the whole thing. ""I know for a lot of players it's a big stress trying to find what you're passionate about, because what I think a lot of people don't understand is how demanding football is and how much it takes up of your life.   ""There's guys who study whilst playing but it is challenging to get that balance right because footy is so demanding.   ""So I'm happy that I've got a clear outlook on where I want to get to, and I've just got to do the work now to be able to get there."" Beams recognises managing his depression will be a lifelong challenge — but finally feels like he's found solid ground. ""I literally just live day by day — that's what I tell myself,"" Beams said. ""Each day, if I feel good, I acknowledge that within myself and it's been a bit of a challenge because it's strange for me to actually feel good. ""So it's allowing myself to feel those good emotions because it's something that's eluded me for a number of years now — the feeling of actually feeling good and happy with life.   ""It's a great feeling — I get out of bed now full of energy and wanting to attack the day. ""And if I ever feel like I'm drifting off to a place where it's going to put me in a negative frame of mind I just try and centre myself and bring myself back to the present and what's going on right now and what I can control. ""That's all you can do I think — it's a simple way to live life and it sounds easy but it's taken me so many years to be able to practice that and absolutely get it right and to a point where I feel like it's really serving me a lot of benefit.""

21,/news/2020-04-04/coronavirus-canberra-feel-good-community-stories/12114724,"If coronavirus has you feeling (understandably) down, let these stories from the Canberra community cheer you up","As the coronavirus crisis evolves, so too, it seems, does our community spirit. Whether it's taking photographs, delivering curries or collecting groceries, neighbourhood armies of volunteers and local groups across Canberra are coming together to help residents in need. So if you're feeling down with all the news about COVID-19, here's a snapshot of the best ABC Canberra has seen come out of the pandemic so far.   A charitable team of Australian Sikhs has been cooking, packing and delivering 100 meals a day to the doorsteps of Canberrans. ""When there is a person in isolation, we make sure they get a meal every day in isolation until they tell us that they don't need it anymore. Same with the elderly and others,"" Canberra coordinator Paramdeep Singh Nrain, from Turbans 4 Australia said. ""Any person who is not able to cook for themselves, we are trying to provide food."" As the crisis deepens, the 15 volunteers are getting more calls and messages asking for help every day — Mr Nrain even drove to Yass on Monday to drop off two food hampers to a family. But he said the ability to serve his community was a privilege. ""We are feeling so proud to call ourselves Australian Sikh. So we are feeling really great,"" Mr Nrain said.   Jyoti Dambiec is commandeering people in her Evatt neighbourhood to support those around them during the COVID-19 crisis. Set up next to a longstanding street library on a bike path, locals can stop by, borrow a book or submit a request to Jyoti and her team for help. Alongside tasks like gardening and collecting groceries, Jyoti is using her skills in the kitchen to help others. ""I might make water kefir and I'll … give that to local neighbours who come and pick that up from a distance,"" she said. ""I'm just working out how we can connect with the vulnerable people in our community. People that may be housebound, can't get out and do shopping, things like that."" Some street libraries in southern Canberra are also still operational, like this one in Rivett, which is disinfected regularly so you can browse safely.   If you'd prefer not to visit a street library, some of your most loved children's books are going online with virtual story time. ACT Emergency Services Agency Commissioner Georgeina Whelan took to social media on Thursday to read There's A Sea In My Bedroom for parents and kids isolating at home.   And Libraries ACT has moved both story time and its ever-popular Giggle and Wiggle program online after being forced to close this week. Even the minister in charge of libraries, Chris Steel, got on board for a story time session. ""We know that there's a huge number of parents working from home at the moment and would like a little bit of help to keep children occupied,"" he said. Libraries ACT have also curated an 'At Home Brain and Boredom Busters' section on their website for both parents and kids to enjoy.     Another way to keep those kiddies entertained during this time is by putting paint to paper. Canberra kids are being encouraged to paint or draw pictures to share online with aged care residents across the ACT, thanks to a dedicated group of early childhood educators.  Many aged care residents are part of Intergenerational Playgroups Canberra, and are facing no meetups with their favourite little people for a while.  Founder Fiona Harris said she hoped the drawings could spark a little bit of joy in what could be a very lonely time. ""Aged Care facilities around the world are facing unprecedented measures due to this crisis. Many social activities for the elderly residents have been suspended, guest visits limited or even banned,"" she said. ""Our art will show the residents that we love and support them, and that they are not forgotten in our hearts."" The project is known as Art for Aged Care, and anyone with a child at home can get involved by having a parent or carer take a picture of their creations.   Sita Norsworthy is army engineer, mum, and a professional photographer.  She wanted to do something to lift everyone's spirits in her street — so she started Canberra's version of The Driveway Project. The idea is pretty simple. Sita gathers people from the same house on their driveway, takes a photo of them from two metres away on the road, and shares the images via Instagram using #thedrivewayproject.  ""I think it's safe to say that the current situation is pretty overwhelming,"" Sita said, adding that she wanted to ""spread some happiness online and remind everybody that we're all in this together"". ""This project will ensure social distancing rules are stuck to, while helping me keep busy — and mentally healthy — doing what I love: taking photos and capturing love!"" So far, Sita has photographed people in Gunghalin, Forde and Ngunnawal, but if you don't live in her area you needn't miss out.  You can see the pretty sweet pics from local neighbourhoods, and neighbourhoods across the country, on Instagram.   While you're out on your driveway, take a peek at your neighbour's windows — the suburban bear hunt has also made its way to the ACT. Inspired by the children's book We're Going on a Bear Hunt, residents around Canberra have been placing teddy bears in windows for local kids to spot from a safe distance while out walking with their family.   Amy Pym is leading the way around her suburb of Forde, in Canberra's north. ""I want the community to feel like we're still people,"" she said. ""We can still live our life and still have fun.""

22,/news/2020-04-04/bill-withers-dead-at-81/12121238,"Bill Withers, legendary soul singer who wrote Lean On Me, dies aged 81","Bill Withers, the legendary US soul singer who wrote Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine has died aged 81 of heart complications.   The three-time Grammy Award winner, who withdrew from making music in the mid-1980s, died on Monday (local time) in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his family.  He is survived by his wife Marcia Johnson and their two children, Todd and Kori. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world,"" the statement from his family said. ""In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones,"" the statement said.   Withers' songs have become the soundtracks of countless cherished moments. Lean on Me, was performed at the inaugurations of both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.    Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me are among Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ""He's the last African-American Everyman,"" musician and bandleader Questlove told Rolling Stone in 2015.  ""Bill Withers is the closest thing black people have to a Bruce Springsteen."" Many who knew Withers or were inspired by him took to social media to express their grief.  Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda referred to Withers as a ""maestro"", singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz said, ""My soul always has & always will be full of your music"", and singer-songwriter John Legend reflected that ""life won't be the same without him"".   Withers, who overcame a childhood stutter, was born the last of six children in the coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia.  He joined the Navy at 17 and spent nine years in the service as an aircraft mechanic installing toilets.  After his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, worked at an aircraft parts factory, bought a guitar at a pawn shop and recorded demos of his tunes in hopes of landing a recording contract.   In 1971, signed to Sussex Records, he put out his first album, Just As I Am, with the legendary Booker T Jones at the helm.  It had the hits Grandma's Hands and Ain't No Sunshine, which was inspired by the Jack Lemmon film Days Of Wine And Roses.  Ain't No Sunshine was originally released as the B-side of his debut single, Harlem.  But radio DJs flipped the disc and the song climbed to number three on the Billboard charts and spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 40. Withers went on to generate more hits a year later with the inspirational Lean on Me, the menacing Who Is He (And What Is He to You) and the slinky Use Me on his second album, Still Bill.   Later would come Lovely Day, co-written with Skip Scarborough and featuring Withers holding the word ""day"" for almost 19 seconds, and Just the Two Of Us, co-written with Ralph MacDonald and William Salter.  His Live at Carnegie Hall in 1973 made Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time. ""The hardest thing in songwriting is to be simple and yet profound. And Bill seemed to understand, intrinsically and instinctively, how to do that,"" Sting said in Still Bill, a 2010 documentary of Withers. Though his songs often dealt with relationships, Withers also wrote ones with social commentary, including ""Better Off Dead"" about an alcoholic's suicide, and ""I Can't Write Left-Handed,"" about an injured Vietnam War veteran. He was awarded Grammys as a songwriter for Ain't No Sunshine in 1971 and for Just the Two Of Us in 1981. In 1987, Withers received his ninth Grammy nomination and third Grammy as a songwriter for the re-recording of the 1972 hit Lean on Me by Club Nouveau.   He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 by Stevie Wonder.  ""I'm not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with. I don't think I've done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West Virginia,"" Withers told Rolling Stone in 2015. ABC/AP",,"April 04, 2020"
23,/news/2020-04-04/tiger-king-netflix-series-is-capitalist-fever-dream/12114106,"Tiger King, Netflix's new true crime series, is a wild ride into the modern American psyche","OJ Simpson was shocked. ""Oh my God,"" he said on Twitter this week.  ""Is America in this bad a shape?"" He was talking about Tiger King, a docuseries that launched on Netflix two weeks ago and is currently the most popular title on the platform in Australia. When even OJ Simpson, who basically invented using popular culture to distract from your criminal history, thinks this is all a bunch of absolute insanity, it makes you pause. Here's why everyone is talking about Tiger King and what it can teach us about the modern American psyche. You've probably seen people recommending Tiger King as a coronavirus-anxiety balm, expressing disbelief at its lunacy or just nonchalantly sharing memes featuring Joe Exotic, the self-described ""gay, gun-carrying redneck with a mullet"". The seven-part series traces the exotic animal market in the United States and, in particular, the small private zoos that showcase those animals to the public. It's partly an examination of the kind of people who do this in a country where loose regulation has led to exploitation, captive breeding and all-out fiascos like the one in Zanesville, Ohio, in 2011, where dozens of exotic animals were shot after being released from a private zoo. But it's also — because this is Netflix — a true-crime drama. There's a murder-for-hire plot and a millionaire who disappeared and may or may not have been fed to tigers.   Then there are the characters.  Hoo boy.  Where to start with them? Joseph Maldonado-Passage, who calls himself Joe Exotic, keeps more than 200 tigers in a ramshackle ""roadside zoo"". Because this is America, he also keeps a film crew that shoots an internet talk show (fronted by him) and makes tiger-themed videos for his country music side-hustle (not a joke).   He is also, we learn in the first episode, mixed up in a plot to have a fellow zoo-owner murdered. ""There was something so odd about the man, and yet he had so much confidence, because he owned the world in his head,"" Rick Kirkham, who was Joe's on-site TV producer, says. It is exhausting trying to recount the various ways in which these people are unbelievable. Joe's mentor is fellow zoo owner Bhagavan ""Doc"" Antle, a ponytailed former Hollywood exotic animal handler with very little in the way of humility and a doctorate in ""mystical science"".   Aside from keeping exotic animals, he keeps women — possibly, the directors suggest, against their will. He has several ""partners"", who have their own residences on the grounds of his zoo in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  One former employee recounts being worked seven days a week and pressured to get breast implants, eventually relenting only so she could get a few days' rest. ""He would say, 'They're free to leave,"" the former employee, Barbara Fisher, says of Antle's female companions.  ""But that's the way it is in all cults."" While he claims to love his animals and adhere to US Department of Agriculture guidelines, he also subjects the cubs to petting by humans and engages in cross-breeding, both of which are discouraged by animal welfare advocates.   Then there's Carole Baskin. Baskin appears at first like the show's baseline of integrity, an ageing Floridian hippie on a quest to shut Joe Exotic down because, she says, he abuses animals and engages in irresponsible breeding practices. But the series questions not only her prior breeding and animal acquisition practices but covers more salacious ground: that she is reportedly the prime suspect in the disappearance of her wealthy husband, Don Lewis. There are many small private zoos in the United States — what are known as ""roadside zoos"". Often, according to the Animal Legal Defence Fund, they keep exotic animals in poor conditions because state and federal regulation is poorly enforced or provides too many loopholes. The situation is the same when it comes to private ownership.  In some US states, there's less paperwork involved in getting a lion than a dog, according to reporting by National Geographic magazine.  The trade in exotic animals has been booming in recent years, due in part to social media. The World Wildlife Foundation estimates there are 5,000 tigers in the United States, most of them in private residences. That's one of the largest populations anywhere in the world. You can't import exotic animals, but those rules overlook captive breeding, which is how most Americans end up living with exotic pets and which can expose animals to genetic problems. A federal bill that would ban private ownership and cub petting has, despite Baskin's political advocacy, been stalled for the past three years. Only in the United States, right? The series is a reminder of the way Americans' absolutist view of personal liberty can become problematic. ""When I woke up this morning I was in a free f***ing country,"" says Jeff Lowe, a big cat fan whose flashy, playboy lifestyle attracts Joe.  ""And I'm still there.""   Many of these characters believe that nobody, least of all the government, can stop you from pursuing even the most evidently destructive of business practices. In one scene, Joe Exotic — who once ran for president because he thought it would be good for business — tells a TV interviewer that not only will he continue to operate his zoo after an employee loses an arm to a tiger but that if the authorities tried to take his animals away there would be ""a small Waco"". Meanwhile, one of Doc Antle's employees describes, with a resigned smile, working ""8am to midnight"" every day. In a country with little social safety net and a federal minimum wage of $US7.25 ($11.76) an hour, where success and failure are individualised, this is not surprising. At Joe's zoo, his workers raid the meat truck, which delivers discarded supermarket supplies that will be used to feed the tigers. The stuff that isn't passed its use-by date is fair game.   All this is reminiscent of another recent Netflix docuseries, Cheer. That series, about the hectic world of collegiate cheerleading, turned its central character, Navarro College cheer coach Monica Aldama, into a folk hero.  But what it also did was show a kind of capitalism in micro: disenfranchised young people enduring back-breaking misery in the service of a victory they are told is theirs but that really rewards the people above them. So ... where does this all leave us? Carole Baskin had a fairly strong reaction to the docuseries. In a lengthy blog post, she outlined what she said were a series of lies and inaccuracies about her sanctuary, Big Cat Rescue, and the way it treats its animals, employees and volunteers. She also said the show ""had the sole goal of being as salacious and sensational as possible to draw viewers"". ""As part of that, it has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don in 1997. ""They did not care about truth,"" she said of the directors, Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin. ""The unsavoury lies are better for getting viewers."" Joe Exotic, who remains in jail, is enjoying his newfound support and his 15 minutes of fame, Goode told The New York Times. This month he filed a lawsuit against the US Government seeking nearly $US100 million in damages because he was, he says, falsely convicted. Antle said on Facebook the staff of his Myrtle Beach Safari zoo were ""very disappointed"" with the Netflix series. ""It is important to understand that this series is not a documentary; it's sensationalised entertainment with paid participants,"" he said. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister appealed this week for anyone with information about the disappearance of Don Lewis to come forward.   Meanwhile, the internet continues to eat this all up — the sordid lives of the haves, the have-nots, the strivers and the down-and-outs becomes mass entertainment. At one point, Kirkham, the producer who sought to turn Joe's life into a reality TV show, says: ""It's just a crazy little comedy between exotic animal lovers.""

24,/news/2020-04-03/arts-theatre-companies-australia-council-funding/12119924,"Arts sector hit again as La Mama Theatre, Sydney Writers' Festival and others lose Australia Council funding amid coronavirus shutdown","Already cash-strapped in the face of coronavirus, Australia's arts sector says it's been further devastated after dozens of organisations lost federal funding. Melbourne's La Mama, the tiny 53-year-old company recognised as the birthplace of Australian theatre, is among 49 arts companies to lose funding from the Australia Council, the Government's arts funding body. Other casualties are high-profile troupes for young people including the St Martins and Polyglot theatres in Melbourne, Barking Gecko in Perth, and Sydney's Australian Theatre for Young People, which counts Nicole Kidman, Baz Luhrmann and Rebel Wilson among its alumni. Sydney Writers' Festival failed to secure funding, as did the Museum of Contemporary Art. Theatre Network Australia executive director Nicole Beyer said the sector was ""devastated and shocked so many companies have lost funding"". ""This has happened because the Australia Council's funding has been frozen since 2013 — in fact it's been chipped away at by about $6 million a year,"" Ms Beyer said. She said the loss of key funding would result in the closure of some smaller companies, while larger organisations would need to scale back their activities, cancel some programs or make up the money from elsewhere. ""The problem is, with the impact of COVID-19 as well, there's nowhere for them to get extra funding from,"" she said. Australia Council funding is awarded every four years via a competitive application process, and organisations must reapply at the end of the funding cycle. The council flagged these cuts last year, when, faced with limited funding, it decided to fund fewer companies, but give them more money. Ninety-five organisations, including Indigenous companies Ilbijerri and Yirra Yaakin, were successful in securing funding and will receive up to $500,000 a year for four years from 2021. La Mama chairman Richard Watts said it was the second blow for the theatre company in a year and a half, after its theatre was burned down by an electrical fire.   La Mama relies on the Australia Council for a significant proportion of its funding, but Mr Watts said the loss would not spell the end of the company, which has at different times been home to artists including Cate Blanchett, Jack Hibberd, Graeme Blundell, Judith Lucy and Julia Zemiro. In recent days the Australia Council has attempted to ease the pain of the almost-complete shutdown of the performing and visual arts sectors.  It redirected $5 million in funding towards a Resilience Fund immediately accessible to the sector, and it delayed the announcement of the four-year funding by a week while it sought to soften the blow. It has done that by continuing some funding for an extra year, until 2022.   That means the 49 companies whose funding will ultimately be discontinued will receive a lifeline, in the form of a smaller amount of funding, for 2021. The Australia Council funded this stop-gap with an additional $4 million saved from other activities and by asking the successful companies to absorb a 30 per cent reduction in their grant for 2021. The executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts, Esther Anatolitis, said arts organisations needed their funding boosted rather than cut. ""Despite unprecedented whole-of-industry collaboration in outlining urgent needs for stimulus to prevent industry collapse, I am deeply concerned that those specific needs are not understood,"" she said. ""At this perilous time we should be increasing funding for the organisations that power the industry, not undermining their capacities."" Australia Council chief executive Adrian Collette said the arts had been dealt a particularly bad blow with the COVID-19 shut down, and they one-year stop-gap funding was an acknowledgement of that. ""We were working with the Government on a package that might have meant more for four-year funding, but in these circumstances [COVID-19] that was a conversation that really did get overwhelmed."" He acknowledged some companies would struggle to continue. ""There will certainly be some [companies] that will face insolvency and they're the ones we really have to focus on during the next three months or so,"" he said.","By arts, culture and entertainment reporter Michaela Boland","April 06, 2020"

26,/news/2020-04-03/childrens-author-annabel-blake-normalises-women-in-science/12092980,Children's book author Annabel Blake targets the STEM gender imbalance through Talu Tales book series,"In her time as a professional extreme sport skier, a psychology research student and during a stint working at Google, Annabel Blake noticed a reoccurring theme: an alarming shortage of women.   Now a children's book author, Blake is creating lead female lead characters who work in male-dominated industries, like science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields, to encourage young girls into new career paths from an early age. ""When I was skiing, it made sense, because it seemed like I was doing stupid things and girls are too smart to be throwing themselves off jumps and living with stinky boys, and I was always hurting myself,"" she said. ""When I moved into the research field, I noticed there were less girls there too and even fewer in technology — something wasn't adding up."" Blake said she could see the problem started with girls from a young age. Girls were simply not even considering a career in a STEM field because they assumed they were jobs for men. ""We go all the way back to before girls have started school, and by the age of six, girls are less likely than boys to believe members of their gender are really smart,"" she said. ""When you ask kids to draw a scientist, two thirds of children aged 9 to 11 draw a man.""   Blake and her co-author, Deborah Ho have, made a concerted choice to feature women in lead roles in their Talu Tales children's books. The first instalment features a female astronaut, the second a marine biologist and an archaeologist in the third.   ""Today, only 11 per cent of space explorers are women,"" Blake said. ""So not only do we see an overwhelming minority, space is such an awesome thing to look at and anyone can look up — it's a gateway science."" She hopes the books will normalise women doing STEM jobs, so when girls start considering their options, they do not have gender stereotypes in mind. ""Play and storytelling play an important role in showing young kids who they can be and what's normal,"" Blake said. ""In the children's literature space, there are a lot of gendered play games and only one fifth of best-selling children's books feature women in the lead. ""We see that as a big problem in limiting girls' beliefs in their ability at a young age."" Annabel Blake says there is a ""leaky pipeline"" as girls slowly drop out of careers in STEM as they grow older, and by the time they are choosing their own subjects at high school, the gender imbalance is obvious. That then leads into the workforce, where Ms Blake says just 16 per cent of people working in STEM are women.   Macinley Butson is one of Australia's most promising young scientists, currently planning for a clinical hospital trial of a protective shield she has developed for breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. She said while she was brought up in a supportive family featuring scientists and a librarian, there is a need for STEM role models for young girls. ""We've been brought up with a preconceived idea that it's [science] a male job and your scientist is an old guy with white frizzy hair in a lab coat,"" Ms Butson said. ""It can be a bit of fun, but it can potentially lead to women being more afraid to go into STEM. ""If we can have a little bit of exposure to these young minds at that age and challenge the status quo, those ideas will stick with them and it might be that one book that had a character that inspired them.  ""Even that one role model can make such a difference, so I think it's incredible what Annabel [Blake] is doing and doing intentionally, and giving girls role models to push into whatever field they want to be in.""",ABC Illawarra      By Justin Huntsdale,"April 03, 2020"

And while some are spending their time bingeing on TV reruns, and others are reconnecting with books, many are turning to games — so much so, that consoles are sold out, or near to, at retailers across Australia. ""Now, more than ever, games can be the one way that children and adults can stay in touch and keep those social interactions happening,"" says Thorsten Kaeding, curator at the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA). ""Particularly online ones where it doesn't matter that you're not all in the same room."" Recently-released Nintendo game Animal Crossing: New Horizons seems to be flourishing off the back of our new shut-in culture — and best-selling classics like Minecraft are also scratching a quarantine itch. What do they have in common? Maintaining social connections and realistic goal setting. ""They [games] can give you a sense of achievement as you set and achieve goals,"" says Angharad Yeo, host of ABC ME's Good Game Spawn Point.   Alex Walker, editor of Kotaku Australia, says ""relaxing games"" are also a popular option right now. ""Chill video games are really accessible, which is crucial in an environment where a lot of people are cooped up for one reason or another and they need some form of escapism to stay happy and healthy."" ""While some people really enjoy unwinding through a fast-paced frantic game ... slower, more relaxing games are better for many others — particularly those who haven't played a game in a long time, or those who haven't played modern video games at all."" We asked Kaeding, Yeo and Walker for the most soothing and chilled-out games for adults and kids to play while in lockdown.   In this low-key locally-made game, you play a wombat searching for a home by exploring six landscapes (all inspired by Victorian national parks), waddling along and interacting with Australian flora and fauna. Yeo describes Paperbark as ""like an interactive storybook, and so beautifully Australian"" — and in fact, Melbourne-based start-up Paper House were inspired by Aussie classics like Possum Magic and Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, as well as the Australian landscape watercolours of Albert Namatjira. ""This is my top recommendation for families with young children,"" says Yeo. ""It's not a long game but it's a beautiful way of sharing the storybook experience ... and it's very heartwarming and cute.""   Available on: iOS   Firewatch is a first-person adventure video game set in 1989 in the real-life Shoshone National Forest. You play Henry, a grieving man on ""fire lookout"" in the forest over a hot dry summer, and as you hike around, accompanied only by the voice of your supervisor Delilah on your two-way radio, a mystery begins to unfold. ""The game is visually vibrant with a wonderful, relaxing soundtrack, backed up with some great voice acting and writing,"" says Walker. It's a story-driven video game suited to teens and upwards, made by Campo Santo, a small San Francisco-based developer. ""The whole game only lasts a few hours, but it's a wonderfully immersive adventure that's a perfect tonic for today's frantic, uncertain world,"" Walker says.   Available on: PC/Mac/PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch   Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the fifth game in Nintendo's Animal Crossing series, offering a life simulation in real-time. In this edition of the game, your human character moves to an island that you can tailor to your heart's content, selecting decorations and inviting anthropomorphic characters to join your settlement. ""If you've got a Switch this is pretty much the game to be playing right now,"" says Yeo. ""It's a huge game you can really lose yourself in. I've probably spent about 10 hours just fishing since it came out.""  Alongside all your new anthropomorphic friends, you can also visit your IRL friends on their islands in the game. ""Everything about Animal Crossing is about being chill, making friends, and making things nice. It's dripping in positivity,"" Yeo says. Available on: Nintendo Switch   In this 2D action-adventure video game, made by Adelaide indie games developer Team Cherry, you operate an insect-like Knight exploring an underground, interconnected and hand-drawn world. Hollow Knight is one of the less chilled-out games on the list, but as Kaeding says: ""You can just lose yourself in its beautiful open-world, which takes you away from this one."" Which might explain why it's been so popular worldwide, selling almost three million copies in the first two years of its release — a huge feat given it was made by the three-person Team Cherry. ""It's also really hard, so you have to really immerse yourself in it and spend time and get to know it. You can while away weeks or months just on this one game,"" says Kaeding.  Team Cherry are currently developing a sequel called Hollow Knight: Silksong.   Available on: PC/Mac/PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch   Mini Metro is a minimalist simulator game that allows you to build train systems for 20 real-life cities, including London, Berlin and Melbourne.  It begins simply, with a few coloured lines that you 'drag outwards' to design your own complex subway networks.  ""It's a time-management game that is super relaxing for a lot of people because it's so visually stunning and easy to understand,"" Walker says. Yeo, who counts Mini Metro as ""a personal favourite zone-out game"", says that while it's ""easy to learn, it's hard to master"" — but says that the feeling of playing can be ""meditative and rewarding, and there's no real sense of disappointment when you fail and start again"". Mini Metro (and it's sister game Mini Motorways) was made by New Zealand developers Dinosaur Polo Club. Available on: iOS/Android/PC/Mac/PlayStation 4/Nintendo Switch   In the BAFTA award-winning 2014 game Monument Valley, you guide the silent Princess Ida through levels of ""impossible structures"" by rotating and sliding pathways, uncovering hidden pathways and shifting your perspective. ""This beautiful mobile game has M.C. Escher-style puzzles that are challenging and satisfying,"" Yeo says. The game is also inspired by Japanese prints and minimalist 3D design. Monument Valley 2 came out in 2017 (and is currently free on some platforms) and there's a film adaptation in the works. ""It's incredibly cleverly designed and is something that anyone can pick up and play. My mum loves it ... and constantly asks me when Monument Valley 3 is coming out,"" Yeo says.   Available on: iOS/Android   In 2019's runaway gaming hit, you play a very naughty goose determined to wreak havoc on a small English village.  ""Most of us have had a terrible experience with geese. They're horrible creatures. They're loud. They attack people and everything around them. They steal your lunch. Untitled Goose Game lets you be the goose,"" Walker says. Made by House House, a small indie studio in Melbourne, Untitled Goose Game was recently nominated for a BAFTA award, after winning game of the year at the 2020 DICE Awards, one of the biggest international gaming awards. ""Untitled Goose Game will just take you away from your worries, and it's completely and utterly addictive,"" Kaeding says. ""Goose Game is about having a laugh, something we all need more of right now,"" says Walker.   Available on: PC/Mac/PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch   Florence is an award-winning Australian game that essentially takes the form of an interactive graphic novel, telling the love story of Florence Yeoh, a 25-year-old Malaysian-Chinese-Australian.  ""Florence is a great one to keep your social skills working while you're isolating yourself; it's a game where you have to think about relationships and how you get on with people, and I think that's a really important skill to keep up,"" Kaeding says. Florence is made by Ken Wong, the designer behind Monument Valley. ""It's a beautiful game, it's not stressful, it's not high pressure, it's nice and chill,"" says Kaeding.   Available on: iOS/Android/PC/Mac/Nintendo Switch   Stardew Valley is an open-ended farm simulation game in which you play a character who relocates to their late grandfather's farm to get it back up and running again.  The game can be played with up to three other players online, and is suitable for the whole family. Walker describes it as ""a beautiful pixel adventure about getting back in touch with nature"", and the game offers a change of pace as you focus on achieving small tasks, including caring for animals, fishing, exploring the local caves or making wine and cheese. ""There's a whole town of characters to meet — and marry! — and it's a really cute, peaceful game that you could easily spend hundreds of hours in,"" says Walker.   Available on: iOS/Android/PC/Mac/PlayStation 4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch   Sandbox video game Minecraft has no clear aims; players simply occupy a blocky 3D world that they can extract materials from, build and craft as they see fit. ""It is quite a creative game, and it's a fantastic thing when you're cooped up by yourself to get to go into a big world and build things — it's very liberating, it expands our experience,"" says Kaeding. Minecraft isn't just a game, it's a pop culture phenomenon; it is played by 112 million active users each month, and is the best-selling video game of all time. You can also use a Minecraft server to play the game with your friends.  ""Particularly as people are retreating to their houses, games that you can play together, interactive ones, are important,"" says Kaeding.

28,/news/2020-04-02/indigenous-dot-paintings-coronavirus-health-message-uluru/12110988,Uluru artists depict COVID-19 health messages through traditional Indigenous dot paintings,"Indigenous artists have taken the COVID-19 messaging into their own hands at Mutitjulu, the small Aboriginal community nestled at the base of Uluru, 500 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs.   As soon as the Federal Government announced the coronavirus health messaging, the artists at the Walkatjara Art Centre started to interpret the messaging into traditional dot paintings. Indigenous interpreter, Kathy Tozer, helps facilitate meetings between the Anangnu people and Parks Australia. ""We called a meeting straight away when we heard about coronavirus so that Anangnu could speak about how they were feeling about it,"" she said.  ""One of the things that came up was that they wanted to put messages out around the community. ""To let all the people in the community know that you shouldn't be travelling and all of the safety messages.""     Seven artists from the community have painted the messages onto canvases. ""They are hanging in different places around the community,"" Ms Tozer said. ""[In] the store, next to hand washing station, in the clinic, in the job network … so that people can see messages in their own language and in their own iconography.""   Yaritji Miller's painting depicts Australia in the centre of the canvas with two hands. ""To block the disease from coming onto our country,"" she said. Ms Miller said that there has been a range of emotions and attitudes for Mutitjulu residents to process. ""Some of us are really quite worried. Some of us are scared,"" she said. ""Some people don't understand the full implications of this."" The artists all agree that it is essential for community members to recognise the seriousness of coronavirus and the need to protect the vulnerable in the community.   ""We do have to think about this new danger that's come to us,"" Ms Miller said. ""And we do have to understand that now there are new rules, and that some of which are made by governments that we need to pay attention to, and not just think it's something that won't affect us."" Pollyanne Mumu's canvas represents a group of Anangnu together with health staff. ""They have brought all of the paper information that tells us about the new dangerous disease,"" she said.  Having never seen an image of what the virus looked like, all the artists agreed that they used their imaginations to translate it into dot art form. ""That's just how our minds work,"" Ms Mumu said. ""When we visualised it that's the image that came to our mind. So that's how we portrayed it.""   Parks Australia announced on March 24 that all parks within their jurisdiction, including Uluru and Kata Tjuta, would be temporarily closed for a minimum of two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Artist Elizabeth Wilson says she welcomes the closure, believing it is necessary in order to protect the community members who sell their art directly to tourists at Uluru's sunset viewing area. ""It's the right thing to shut the park because of the dangers of the virus,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will be before we can open the park to tourists again. ""But we do look forward to that time because a lot of people have no other income than the money that they can make from selling their canvases to tourists. ""So whilst it was really important for our community safety we're glad that it closed.""    Before the park was temporarily shut Ms Wilson painted about the dangers of her community making physical contact with tourists. ""I've painted about the dangers of doing that now because of the virus,"" she said. ""Because even though it seems invisible, we can still catch it from those tourists that are coming from other parts of the country and the world. ""I painted that scene up with tourists on one side, the canvas in the middle and the artist on the other, and then behind the artists, unknown to themselves, is the virus.""

29,/news/2020-04-02/black-summer-debris-set-for-national-museum-exhibition/12114144,National Museum's Black Summer exhibition to preserve memories of Australia's bushfire crisis,"Debris from the catastrophic summer bushfires is set to feature in an art exhibition created by the National Museum of Australia.   The Canberra museum is collecting images, videos and objects from across the country, including Cobargo, on the New South Wales Far South Coast, for display in the Black Summer exhibit. Cobargo's main street was devastated by the Badja Forest Fire on New Year's Eve 2019 — among the debris and destruction was a melted phone booth, which caught the eye of Museum curator Libby Stewart. ""Just look at it,"" Ms Stewart said. ""It's a very powerful object with the plastic all melted down — it looks like a dystopian painting.""   Ms Stewart says the phone booth not only illustrates the sheer heat of the fire, but also symbolises the challenges in communication during the height of the emergency. ""That was Cobargo's only public payphone and it was out of action — no-one could communicate,"" she said. ""The iconic object will help to tell a story, not just of the damage of the fires but also community resilience."" The National Museum contacted Telstra and the community for permission to acquire the piece as part of the exhibition, which is due to open in the middle of next year. Curators will spend the next 12 months visiting bushfire-affected communities across Australia in search of more objects to exhibit. ""I'm just astounded by how the community has helped each other,"" Ms Stewart said. ""It's heartening to see. ""But on the other hand, it's just complete devastation that they're dealing with.""   David Wilson is the owner of Cobargo's post office, which sits across the road from the phone booth. He said preserving the object will help remind people of what the town lost.  ""People forget, they forget very quickly,"" he said. ""It could bring back attention and refresh people's memories. ""They can look at it and wonder what happened to our town and our people."" Mr Wilson's home was one of 448 homes destroyed in the Bega Valley Shire during the fire crisis. The same fire that tore through Cobargo also led to the deaths of father and son Robert Salway, 63, and Patrick Salway, 29, who were well known in the town. Mr Wilson said the bushfires, as well as its recovery, had been all but forgotten amid the outbreak of COVID-19. ""Coronavirus is on top of property loss, lives lost, loss of income,"" he said. ""It's a devastating additional blow for us and it takes the attention off recovery. ""Nobody is thinking about fire recovery — it's all moved on to a new topic."" Mr Wilson said preserving the town's phone booth as part of an art exhibition would help document its history. ""They've picked something that everybody should recognise and say, 'Wow, that was hot,'"" he said. ""I think it's an amazing idea because phone booths may not even be around in the future.""",ABC South East NSW      By Claire Wheaton and Adriane Reardon,"April 02, 2020"

In February, the singer-songwriter won Australia Decides, outscoring Casey Donovan, Vanessa Amorosi and seven other acts to clinch a spot at Eurovision. However, last month growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus led the European Broadcasting Union and this year's scheduled hosts, the Netherlands, to announce the cancellation of 2020's event.  The art-pop performer had delivered the winning song, Don't Break Me, with a dramatic staging at the live Gold Coast final.     While appearing at this year's Australia Decides, Dami Im — who produced Australia's best performance at Eurovision when she came second with Sounds of Silence in 2016 — drew a big reaction when she announced that she was going to throw her hat in the ring for 2021. But SBS has now followed the lead of a number of countries involved in the contest by confirming Montaigne's place as Australia's representative next year. ""I'm so happy to receive this good news during such times,"" Montaigne said in a statement. ""At home, we've started this ritual of cracking open a fortune cookie daily and reading our fortunes to each other and I got one that read, 'You will be sharing great news with all the people you love'. I'm so glad it came true!""     Montaigne, whose musical talents were discovered in triple j's Unearthed project in 2012, is an ARIA-winning artist who has collaborated with the likes of the Hilltop Hoods. With the contest to decide Australia's entrant for next year now not needed, SBS said the focus would turn to developing new music. ""Although SBS and fans alike will miss Eurovision — Australia Decides 2021, this will honour Australia's decision and give Montaigne the chance to show the world what we already know — that she is an incredibly talented, exciting and original artist,"" SBS commissioning editor and Australia's Eurovision head of delegation Josh Martin said. ""Our focus will now shift to a new song for 2021 and Montaigne is not wasting a moment of this period of isolation with many new ideas already on the table!""   Eurovision rules do not allow the 2020 songs to be chosen for next year.    ",,"April 02, 2020"
31,/news/2020-04-02/thylacine-hunter-neil-waters-documentary/12111484,Tasmanian tiger quest catches eye of Vice documentary makers,"If an animal is declared extinct more than 80 years ago, most people would assume it no longer exists — but Neil Waters is not one of those people.   Neither are the almost 8,000 members of his Facebook group. ""When you talk to scientists about thylacines, you're a bit of a tinfoil hat whack job, because once an animal's declared extinct, that's it, case closed … but they're out there,"" he said. Mr Waters is the president of the Thylacine Awareness Group of Australia, a collection of believers who are convinced the Tasmanian tiger — once the dominant predator across Australia — still roams the island state, and maybe even the mainland. ""I had two sightings in Tassie myself,"" Mr Waters, who lives in Tasmania's north, said.   ""One in 2010 when I was taking the dog for a walk and the second in 2014, when I happened to be peering out my bedroom window and one came walking past late at night.""   The Facebook group and website serve as forums for sharing the items of evidence gathered by people across the country, who also swap notes on the movements, habits and mannerisms of the animal. Since starting his group in 2014, Mr Waters said he had been ""dumbfounded that there was so much information [that] wasn't in the public arena"". Mr Waters said he, and others, use ""basic, citizen science"" to find ""concrete evidence"" of the thylacine's continued existence — employing various types of technology, including cameras and thermal-imaging drones. ""There are plenty of large, interesting footprints in the area where I live, which makes us think there's still plenty around,"" he said.  ""We find the odd kangaroo with its head missing, which is also an indication they're in the area because they like to feed on the blood-filled organs of smaller marsupials.""   Photos of animals torn apart by larger predators, along with images of paw prints, night-vision captures of wildlife in the bush and video stills of what are purported to be sightings also feature on the group's webpages. ""It gives people a safe place to talk about their information where they wouldn't be laughed at or ridiculed,"" Mr Waters said. ""The world is in dire need of good news stories right now and anything that gives people hope and a bit of a focus on the future is going to be a good thing."" The quest for the thylacine has attracted the attention of documentary makers David Elliot-Jones and Naomi Ball, with Screen Australia awarding them a $50,000 grant to make Searching for the Tassie Tiger, a documentary project which will follow Mr Waters and members of his group.   The film, which will be distributed globally by Vice Media, will be shot mostly in north-east and north-west Tasmania, once the coronavirus crisis is over. ""I was really drawn to it because of the environmental element of it,"" said the film's director, Naomi Ball. ""It's very much the same as what we're doing to our environment now on a much larger scale and with the bushfire season that we've had, we're really seeing what human impact can do to our environment."" Ms Ball said despite the official status of the tiger as being extinct, ""people are seeing something"". She said it would be ""wild"" if they managed to capture a thylacine on camera, but that was not their main goal. ""If that happens, I'm going to be absolutely blown away,"" she said.  ""But we're really focussed on the search, the people that are searching and the characters that they are, the reason why they've come to the search and why they've made it their fight.""   Mr Waters said the filmmakers could see the ""importance of what we're doing"". ""They want to give us the opportunity to get that story out there a little bit further, on an international level, where it really deserves to be,"" he said. But what of the sceptics? What does Mr Waters say to them? ""I'd just tell those people to sit tight and be patient and we'll try to address that for them.""

32,/news/2020-04-01/goats-running-wild-wales-town-coronavirus-lockdown/12111152,Wild goats invade Welsh town of Llandudno as residents stay home to avoid coronavirus,"While the humans are away, the goats will play. Or at least they are in this Welsh town.

Key points:A herd of Kashmiri goats have been roaming the Welsh coastal town of LlandudnoThe goats have spent the past three days wandering the streets, feasting on garden hedges and flowersImages and video of the wandering goats have gone viral online    
 A wild herd of Kashmiri goats has taken over the deserted town centre of Llandudno.  The animals, who normally roam free on a nearby headland jutting out into the Irish Sea, have taken advantage of streets left empty due to coronavirus measures and wandered into the Welsh town, spending the past three days feasting on garden hedges and flowers. Like other countries affected by the global coronavirus crisis, the United Kingdom has imposed strict social distancing measures, including shop and school closures, and the authorities have asked everyone to stay at home except for essential travel.   According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the UK has had 1,789 deaths and 25,481 confirmed cases of COVID-19.   So with the streets of Llandudno unnaturally quiet, the goats have been free to wander the town undisturbed. Town councillor Carol Marubbi said the goats did not normally come into town unless the weather was awful, but on this occasion she said they probably realised something unusual was going on because there were so few people around. ""I think they're probably feeling a bit lonely and they have come down to have a look around,"" Cr Marubbi said. Kashmiri goats have lived on the Great Orme promontory near Llandudno since the days of Queen Victoria, when the species became popular in Britain due to a fashion for shawls made from their soft cashmere wool.   Cr Marubbi said the herd of about 150 goats, some of whom had kids in February, were a well-known local attraction and most residents did not mind having their hedges nibbled by them. ""I'm a big fan,"" she said. ""I love them because they are characters.""   With millions of people stuck at home sharing light-hearted content online to alleviate the tedium of the lockdown, images and video of the goats roving around the streets have been a hit on social media, with #goats and #Llandudno trending on Twitter. ""Just love this. Looks like they are definitely in charge,"" wrote Welsh Twitter user Sue Foster. ""Who we gonna call? Goat busters."" Reuters  ",,"April 02, 2020"

34,/news/2020-04-01/houseparty-delete-app-says-it-will-pay-for-smear-proof/12109942,"Houseparty app, facing wave of deletions, says it will pay $1 million for 'proof' of hacking smear","It was set to be the platform for these isolated times. Downloads of group-video app Houseparty surged in recent weeks as friends and family members, in a coronavirus-lockdown world, sought to move their IRL relationships online. But now Houseparty is facing a wave of deletions following rumours the platform is compromising users' data security. Here's what you need to know. In the past day, Twitter has been full of users claiming their Spotify, PayPal and iCloud accounts have been compromised and blaming Houseparty for the breach, though without proof.  Some share screenshots of notifications from those other apps alerting the user to a new, potentially suspicious log-in. Epic Games, which owns the app, said the claims Houseparty was responsible for this were inaccurate. ""We've found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,"" a spokesperson told the ABC. PayPal said no accounts globally had been compromised. In any case, ""how to delete Houseparty account"" became the number one worldwide trending search term on Google in the 24 hours to Wednesday morning after posts urging users to ditch the app spread quickly. The app's developers are now offering a $US1 million ($1.6 million) reward for proof of what it suspects was a ""paid commercial smear campaign"".   Epic Games said in a statement to the ABC that its investigation had found many of the original tweets spreading the claims had been deleted or the accounts suspended. However, others remain online. Houseparty said earlier this week ""all Houseparty accounts are safe"". ""The service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn't collect passwords for other sites,"" it said. Paul Haskell-Dowland, the associate dean for computing and security in the School of Science at Edith Cowan University, said users should not be concerned the app had compromised their data security.   ""The likelihood is this is not a breach of any kind of the Houseparty app,"" he told the ABC. ""If indeed there were, with an organisation behind it like Epic Games, it's very likely that that would have been addressed very quickly and they would be taking preventative measures and indeed reaching out to people to inform them.""   He also said that it was very unlikely a company with a reputation like Epic's would intentionally introduce a backdoor into its platform that would allow it to compromise other services on a user's device. Lukas Stefanko, from cybersecurity firm ESET, told Forbes the app ""doesn't provide a lot of in-app options and settings, which creates less scenarios for exploiting security issues"". Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said it was either going to be an example of a commercial smear, as Houseparty alleged, or a case where a handful of users had been compromised, possibly because of what is known as a credential stuffing attack. That is where log-in details for users have ended up on a database following a prior hack like the one that hit Canva last year. Criminals then simply use bots to try those passwords out on other apps, like Houseparty, working on the assumption many people re-use passwords across platforms. Deleting your account will not help you if someone actually has gained access to accounts other than your Houseparty one. Still, Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said uninstalling the app was the obvious solution if people were concerned about an app's security. To do that: As a standard protective measure, you should never use the same password for all your platforms, particularly if you are still using something like ""password1"" or ""12345"". Instead, use a password manager, which generates strong log-ins for all your platforms, and consider two-factor authentication. ""I am using 1Password and I have got over 350 unique passwords stored within that system,"" Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said. ""Should a particular set of credentials get lost or stolen, then it is only going to affect that one service.""",By music and pop culture reporter Paul Donoughue,"April 03, 2020"
35,/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-isolation-quarantine-costumes-mental-health/12109354,Coronavirus isolation can still be fabulous: Housemates create dress-up challenge to lift spirits,"After a nine-day holiday in South Africa, these three Australian housemates didn't imagine they'd be spending another two weeks locked in their apartment together. So they decided to have some fun with it. They'd spent their nine-day holiday avoiding the 'C' word as much as possible. Coronavirus was far from the minds of Andrew Balnaves, his husband Carl Matto and their housemate Lisa Ritchie as they danced in sparkly costumes at Cape Town's Bazique Festival. But when the party was over, their new reality set in.       Upon their return to Melbourne they were forced into a mandatory 14-day quarantine period as part of the Government's plan to slow the spread of coronavirus. ""We woke up the next morning and it hit us — oh, we can't go outside,"" Mr Balnaves said. ""Lisa said, 'oh, as if we haven't been together for the last five days now we've got to be in the house for the next 14'."" But rather than get down about it, they decided to focus on the positives. They had a full pantry thanks to wonderful friends, plenty of gin and tonic and a wardrobe full of costumes.   ""We challenged ourselves to a 14-day costume challenge using only the clothing, costumes and props we have in our apartment,"" Mr Balnaves said. ""They're packed down into vintage suitcases — one for wigs, one for tops, bottoms, shoes, bags."" The trio regularly host dress-up dinner parties for friends. Mr Balnaves also runs an events business, directing boutique gala dinners, conferences and launches, but since the coronavirus crisis all of his work has been cancelled. As boredom and the enormity of the disaster became more apparent, they decided their dress-up challenge was a way to bring some joy to people in a time of doom and gloom.           Ms Ritchie said she had to convince herself it was OK to provide a distraction from the news.   ""We're three big personalities in this apartment for two weeks, how would we keep ourselves and our minds busy and distracted in a good way? I didn't think it was a good thing to be watching the news constantly. You somehow seem to get glued to it. ""I don't think we've ever had a time like this in our lives, the closest I can think of is 9/11. It's easy to go into a downward cycle emotionally. ""People might think we're frivolous. But it's for mental health, it's for connection with the people around us."" Initially the challenge was a way of connecting with their own friendship network. But social media helped spread their project far and wide.   Since receiving thousands of shares and comments on social media, the three say they hope their photos provide a few minutes of distraction during these challenging times, and are calling on others to get involved with 'quaranqueen'. The housemates' official quarantine period is about to end, but they're vowing to keep up the challenge while they continue self-isolation.  ""We're just trying to spread a bit of sunshine, a bit of fabulousness,"" Mr Balnaves said.    ",Story Lab      By Margaret Burin,"April 01, 2020"

Festival production manager Ahva Dub said organisers wanted the event to proceed in some form to support local artists, despite COVID-19 social-gathering restrictions causing a shutdown of the industry. ""From 25,000 [people] down to no public interaction, it's a bit of a turnaround, but you've got to move with the times,"" Mr Dub said. ""Being able to broadcast it [virtually], we can still pay the artists and technical crew from the grant money we've received from the Government. ""It seemed only fair to do our best to put on a good show, in whatever format that could happen in.""     The festival is one of a growing number of events heading online, including the livestreaming of festival Isol-Aid to help combat the more than $300 million in income lost by musicians during Australia's coronavirus shutdown. ""We're giving the artists a chance to get their talents out there still … and bringing it to people at home who might be in isolation,"" Mr Dub said. ""It'll be just like Nightcliff Seabreeze is normally — it gives a sense of togetherness, community … and maybe a bit of a light in the darkness."" Mr Dub said the logistical arrangements for a virtual Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival were still a work in progress, particularly with frequent updates to federal and NT restrictions. ""The ideas have been changing with every announcement from the Prime Minister,"" he said. ""What I say now may change again by the time we get to [the event date on] May 9, but we're already starting to connect with the artists — to find out what they're comfortable doing in the current environment, and what wizardry we can accomplish with technology."" Among these artists is the Garrangali Band from the remote Arnhem Land community of Baniyala, which has been under strict COVID-19 travel and quarantine restrictions. Keyboardist Brendan Marika said the festival's move to an online platform meant bands like his could ""still get a message across"", while protecting their wellbeing. ""Money is one thing, but performing and sharing our music is another,"" Marika said. ""[An online event is] not the same … it's not like you can have the crowd there cheering you on, and enjoying, dancing — but the main thing is getting that message across, and this is finding a way.""       NT singer-songwriter Juran Adams, who performs as Jurxn, said she has had to put much of her career ""on hold"" due to the pandemic, but she appreciated the move to a new platform. ""I'll miss the sense of being with a band and kind of losing myself onstage,"" she said. ""But it's just another opportunity to get recognised, and I'm really grateful.""   Other NT festivals and events, including the Finke Desert Race and Garma Festival, have had to cancel and plan for an uncertain future. NT Tourism Minister Lauren Moss said in the past financial year alone, ""the six events delivered by NT Major Events contributed an economic stimulus of $48 million to the NT economy"". ""We know that the many community events from Glenti to Barunga to the Desert Song Festival are also economically, socially and culturally important to the Territory,"" Ms Moss said.   The NT Government said it had been holding emergency talks with event operators during the coronavirus outbreak. ""The events industry is traditionally an agile sector used to dealing with unexpected circumstances — this resilience will help the sector return once the COVID-19 situation ends,"" Ms Moss said. ""NT Major Events has been working closely with our event partners on a case-by-case basis to provide the best help possible."" She said the Territory Government had already ""introduced several measures"" to assist those in the events sector during the pandemic.      ",By Matt Garrick,"April 01, 2020"
37,/news/2020-04-01/the-horror-of-passing-coronavirus-to-a-friend/12105900,'A pretty messed up feeling': The horror of passing coronavirus to a friend,"When musician Dan Williams returned from Japan he knew that put him at risk of coronavirus.   But it was an Uber ride after he returned home that proved the most likely source — a lesson in how long the virus can linger on surfaces in public places. Mr Williams is one of the hundreds of Australians now in self-isolation after having contracted the deadly virus.   Mr Williams returned from a band tour in Japan on March 8. This was prior to the two-week self-isolation rule being introduced for travellers.  He had a recording session with his band, Art Vs Science, on March 16. There he came into close contact with band member and mate Jim Finn, who now also has the virus. Mr Williams had no symptoms by this stage and was told to self-isolate after the recording session.  ""Seems like he would have got it from me, which is a pretty messed up feeling,"" Mr Williams told 7.30. Mr Williams and his partner were tested on March 19.   He said health authorities had since told him he might have been exposed to COVID-19 on March 14, during a car trip with the ridesharing service Uber, after he returned to Australia. ""Apparently either the driver or someone in the car before me had tested positive,"" he said. ""It seems like maybe that's where I caught it from. ""Either that or I caught it and gave it to the Uber driver, which I would feel terrible about."" Since finding out he had tested positive, more friends in Mr Williams' social group have returned positive tests. Mr Finn's fiancee Dom has also been tested for the illness. Mr Finn went into self-isolation in his Bondi apartment, with Dom initially making him meals. ""I can't put my toothbrush back in our communal toothbrush holder when I brush my teeth because otherwise COVID-19 hops straight from my brush onto Dom's,"" he said. ""I'm feeling pretty lethargic but it just might be a mental thing from being stuck in here. Just been doing music and watching Netflix."" Dom has since returned a negative result, but may have contracted a cold. ""Dom woke up and she's got a headache, she's got blocked sinus and a sore throat, and those were the exact symptoms I had when this whole thing kicked off,"" Mr Finn said.   The experience of Mr Williams and his friends has highlighted just how easily the coronavirus is transmitted. Professor Brendan Crabb said the public cannot afford to be complacent. ""We have to assume at the moment [that] surfaces are contaminated,"" he said. Current estimates suggest the coronavirus is more contagious than seasonal influenza, living longer on surfaces and spreading more easily between humans, sometimes before symptoms even emerge.   These estimates suggest a rate of one person on average spreading the virus to about 2.5 people, compared to 1.3 for the flu. ""Given that on average each person under normal circumstances will transmit the virus to three other people, we've got to find out who those other people they've had contact with,"" Professor Crabb said. ""Where we're at in Australia at the moment is using the only tool we have, which is shutting down to a large degree a functioning society, to minimise the chances of people contacting one another."" In a statement, Uber Australia said it is continually monitoring the coronavirus situation and taking steps to keep the community safe, including providing disinfectant to drivers for cars and suspending accounts of drivers with a positive test.     Australian Louise Robertson is stuck inside her Manhattan studio apartment after testing positive — she's not sure how she picked up the illness. ""I started by waking up with a bad headache and I had body aches [but] before that day I had lost my sense of taste and my sense of smell,"" she told 7.30. ""It's really hard to get tested here and [required] several calls, hours on the phone, nurses, different urgent care clinics, trying to convince someone to get [me] tested. ""Eventually I found a clinic around the corner from my apartment, who allowed me to come in and get a nasal swab and then my results came back three days later."" She's witnessing health authorities in the United States become overwhelmed by the virus. ""I think it's time for Australia to take those things seriously. You don't want to end up in a situation like New York."" EDITOR'S NOTE (01/04/2020): This article has been updated to accurately reflect Dan Williams' timeline of being tested for coronavirus. An earlier version of the article inaccurately implied Mr Williams had been tested for coronavirus and then went to a rehearsal with band mates – this is not the case, Mr Williams was tested three days after the rehearsal and was unaware he had it at that time. 7.30 apologises to Dan Williams.

A few years ago the retired GP from Warrnambool, in south-west Victoria, finished a 33,600-piece puzzle with his son, Ben, that was one of the largest in the world.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison raised eyebrows over the weekend when he described jigsaw puzzles as an ""essential"" item, telling Australians it was OK to leave the house to buy them during the coronavirus pandemic. But Dr Philpot is not surprised jigsaw puzzles are back in the spotlight with so many people staying home.   ""You can feel it, you can touch it,"" he said. ""Why did people go back to record discs when they had CDs? ""The new technology comes along but there's this hankering for the old stuff. ""Jigsaw puzzles will always be around and the popularity will just go up and down."" The first jigsaw puzzle Dr Philpot finished was one featuring Edinburgh Castle that his sister brought back from a trip to England in 1956.   ""I must have done that tens of times until the pieces started going missing,"" he said. ""I pretty well knew where every piece was in that puzzle."" Since that first foray into the world of puzzles, Dr Philpot has completed hundreds of them, most made up of thousands of pieces. He has been working on a 9,000-piece puzzle while staying at home during the coronavirus crisis, in between sorting out his stamp collection, reading and playing chess online. Dr Philpot said it was the ""perfect thing"" to work on while stuck at home to fill in the minutes and gaps in the days.   ""You can sit down for 10 minutes to do a jigsaw puzzle,"" he said. ""Of course, when you get really addicted, the jigsaw puzzle becomes the thing you do most of all."" Jackson Heenan, stock controller at Mind Games Melbourne and online game retailer Gumnut.io, said jigsaw puzzles had been flying off the shelves for weeks.   ""I think, for the most part, the customers beat the Prime Minister to it,"" he said. ""We've been selling huge numbers of them in the last two weeks. ""People are realising they're going to need to stay home for a while and need something to keep them busy.""   Even an 18,000-piece Sistine Chapel jigsaw puzzle, which retails for about $350 and had been sitting in the shop for two years, sold in the past fortnight. Although the number of in-store customers had declined, Mr Heenan said online sales had exploded. ""We're just pushing out so many parcels every day, and they're mostly jigsaws."" ""It's definitely of an unprecedented time.""  ",ABC South West Vic      By Sian Johnson and Emma Nobel,"April 01, 2020"
39,/news/2020-03-31/photographer-takes-family-portraits-roadside-during-coronavirus/12105750,SA photographer takes portraits of self-isolating families amid coronavirus pandemic,"A South Australian photographer is using her artistic talents to help connect her country-town community in times of social distancing and self-isolation.   Amy Quist worked as a photographer of newborns, families and weddings for seven-and-a-half years, until recently when her bookings dried up due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The mother of three from Whyalla is now using her skills to capture the ""real, raw and genuine"" moments of families in isolation, through ""The Front Porch Project"".  She photographs families in front of their houses from a safe distance, from the street. ""My intent is to capture as many Whyalla families as I can, at a safe distance,"" she said.  ""I will not be stepping foot on their property, knocking on doors or opening gates, I will be photographing from the roadside."" ""I would love to photograph families as they are … sometimes frazzled, sometimes still in their PJs.""    Ms Quist drew inspiration from the cafes and restaurants in the town, which have been forced to adapt to takeaway business models.  ""I was thinking to myself, 'wow, wouldn't it be great if I could do a takeaway version of my business?'""  Ms Quist said the response from the community had ""blown her away"", with 1,300 social media followers within 24 hours and 500 messages from people wanting to get involved.    ""I'm just rapt with how the community has embraced it and how significant it is to them,"" she said. ""This is history I'm capturing — we're going to be talking about that time when there was that horrible pandemic and everyone was stuck in their home, doing their best to flatten the curve, for years to come."" Ms Quist said she's already taken 45 portraits from the roadside, and has bookings lined up all week.  She is offering the service free of charge, acknowledging that many locals have lost their livelihoods.  But she said some people had offered to pay her or cover her fuel costs.  She said she's taken a range of portraits, from a family who came dressed up in everything from their costume boxes to a couple in their 80s who had not stepped foot outside for weeks.  ""I've had mums come out with a crying child and a glass of wine in hand … and a family who were celebrating their dad's 60th from a distance, holding a sign with some balloons,"" she said.    ""I'm always so honoured to be there for people's greatest moments of their lives, their weddings and birth of their babies … and now I just feel so honoured to be able to capture this moment for them too.""  Ms Quist said she's already received an offer from the local theatre to exhibit her portraits once social distancing rules are relaxed.  Richelle and Lachlan McOmish jumped at the opportunity to have their family portrait taken.  The couple and their daughters Penny, 4, and five-month-old Scarlett have been in self-isolation for 18 days. They have been self-isolating to protect Penny, who has cystic fibrosis. ""We're kind of used to living this way … we're used to keeping away when there's germs and making sure that we have all the essentials that we need,"" Ms McOmish said.  Ms McOmish said she thought it was a great idea to bring the community together, and she wanted her family to be a part of the project too.  ""Once this is all over with COVID-19, I think we'll be able to look back at this and it will be a part of history … and it's nice to see families at home and happy … getting through this together.""

40,/news/2020-03-31/van-gogh-painting-stolen-from-dutch-museum-closed-by-coronavirus/12104954,Van Gogh painting stolen from Dutch museum closed due to coronavirus pandemic,"A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh has been stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, police and the museum have said.   The Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said that The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of Monday (local time). By early afternoon, all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a door in the building's glass facade. Museum general director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is ""angry, shocked, sad"" at the theft. The value of the work, which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, was not immediately known. Van Gogh's paintings, which rarely come up for sale, fetch millions at auction. Police are investigating the theft.   ""I'm shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this has happened,"" Singer Laren museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm said. ""This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen — removed from the community.  ""It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times."" The 25-by-57-centimetre oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background. It dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there, including his famous work The Potato Eaters, in mostly sombre tones.   Later, he moved to southern France, where he developed a far more colourful, vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in 1890. Police said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum.  That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone. A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbours.  Mr van Os said the museum's security worked ""according to protocol"", but he added: ""Obviously we can learn from this."" It is not the first high-profile theft from the museum.  In 2007, thieves stole seven works from its sculpture garden, including a bronze cast of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin.  The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later, missing a leg.

41,/news/2020-03-29/coronavirus-and-problem-gambling/12095714,Gamblers in coronavirus isolation turn to betting on reality TV and even Russian table tennis,"With casinos shut and major sports cancelling or postponing their seasons, bookmakers and gambling sites are still finding ways to reach problem gamblers, experts have warned.   In the place of major sporting events provided by such codes as the AFL and NBA, more niche sports are already being marketed, according to Deakin gambling expert, Professor Samantha Thomas. ""Today in my Twitter feed, there was a promotion for table tennis overseas and when I clicked on that link, it took me to betting markets for a table tennis match in Russia,"" Dr Thomas said. ""This is from an Australian bookmaker and I anticipate that we'll see a lot more of those exotic markets, or more obscure international markets, being promoted because they're the only markets that are open at the moment.   ""Just because sporting matches have stopped in Australia, it doesn't mean that the marketing has stopped and we're definitely still seeing marketing from online gambling companies on television and particularly through social media."" Dr Thomas says the group she is most concerned about is young men, who are traditionally targeted by bookmakers. She wants to see more measures in place to protect them, including banning gambling on credit cards, routinely used to top up gambling accounts. ""Now would be a really good time to fast-track some of those measures to make sure that people are protected at this time,"" she said.     As well as niche sports, Esports, like competitive videogaming, have not faced the same slump as physical gambling. Sally Gainsbury, Associate Professor and co-director of the gambling treatment and research clinic at the University of Sydney, said novelty stakes could also gain popularity in the absence of anything else. ""There are other events that can be bet on — anything from reality TV to the weather to political betting, or other key decisions in society, so there will be options for betting,"" Dr Gainsbury said. ""People are going to be looking for something to fill that void, now if that is betting then they may switch to something different. ""What we don't know is the extent to which regular punters will switch over to these other types of betting, whether they'll reduce their betting or switch to some other form of gambling entirely.""     Dr Gainsbury said in crisis situations, such as emotional upheaval, stress or insecurity, people turned to gambling to escape the reality of their situation. ""In times of crisis, we know historically people do turn to gambling and they continue to gamble in the hopes of it having a positive influence on their life,"" she said. ""Where there have been financial downturns, like the GFC, we do see lottery remains relatively stable. ""We have seen people respond, for example, after the Christchurch earthquake, they suffer gambling problems — also in response to stimulus packages, when people do receive one-off payments, that can end up going to gambling. ""So, there is this response to very uncertain times, both positive and negative, that can lead to increased gambling for some people.""     Tony Clarkson, principal clinical advisor with the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, said it was still too early to tell how problem gamblers would react to the pandemic, but people addicted to poker machines may experience some relief given that most venues had closed. ""A number of people who would experience harm from that type of gambling will be experiencing some relief in the short term because it helps to get away from the product, it helps to get away from the machines, if that's what you gamble on,"" he said. ""But after that initial relief is experienced, then the urges will start to come back.""   Mr Clarkson said support services for problem gamblers, including phone and video counselling were already well-established, and he expected demand to increase over the next few weeks. He urged people who needed help to reach out for support and said a period of self-isolation could serve as an opportunity to heal. ""Problem gambling has a lot of different issues associated with it, like mental health and drug and alcohol addiction and family violence, and sometimes they work in tandem and exacerbate one another,"" Mr Clarkson said. ""This pandemic could potentially give people the opportunity to think about the reasons why [they gamble] and the impact that gambling has on their lives.""

42,/news/2020-03-29/yoda-the-green-sea-turtle-returns-to-the-wild/12097982,"Yoda the green sea turtle released, months after washing up on remote Queensland beach","A green sea turtle that washed up on a remote central Queensland beach has returned to the sea — five months, and $4,000 worth of food later.   When Yoda was delivered to the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre in November 2019 she was covered in barnacles, was sunburnt, dehydrated and weighing a measly 87 kilograms.  But in the five months since then Yoda has made a full recovery and packed on 30 kilograms. The centre has rescued and rehabilitated more than 200 turtles since 2011 and owner, Bob McCosker, said Yoda was the most interactive of them all. ""She just loved her scratches and tickles and she would grab your hand with her rear flippers and hold on while you scratched her,"" he said.  ""She's just loved human interaction.""   Marine biologist, Liam Turner, has been a caretaker at the turtle rehabilitation centre since Yoda was brought into care. ""She's a bit different to everybody else — she's the equivalent of a labrador under the water,"" he said. ""Since she's started to get a bit healthier, she's started to get a little less touchy feely with us, which is a good sign that she's sick of her pool life and she wants to go back into the wild."" Green sea turtles normally feast on seagrasses and algae in the wild, but sick turtles need extra protein to recover. Mr Turner said Yoda was not fussed about becoming a carnivore. ""She was obviously quite underweight when she got here, quite skinny, so she had a while to go in terms of putting on all that weight,"" he said.  ""She took to eating squid pretty quickly though, within a few days she was eating. ""She was like a hoover vacuum. As soon as she started eating she was just putting on weight."" Yoda transitioned from the centre's intensive care tanks into the pool in a matter of weeks.   Yoda's release was particularly special for Mr Turner and his wife, Hayley Coen, as it was the first large turtle they had released since becoming caretakers on the island.  ""It's a rewarding feeling seeing a turtle come in and see it go out the other side,"" he said. ""This might sound weird but I don't want to see her again — I mean that in a good way."" Although Mr McCosker has rehabilitated many turtles in the last nine years, he still felt a mixture of happiness and sadness to see Yoda make her way into the ocean. ""I just hope that she doesn't run into a fisherman or a boat, that's the primary thing,"" he said. ""I hope that she lays lots of eggs. ""In the next 10 to 20 years of her life that's still left, she'll nest at potentially another 10 times — that's potentially another thousand eggs. ""So out of that, one turtle can survive.""    Mr McCosker said recreational fisherman were the most common threat to turtles like Yoda. ""That's the biggest danger in the ocean,"" he said. ""They kill thousands of these animals every year and they know nothing about it."" Mr McCosker said it was not fisherman trying to catch the endangered turtles that was the biggest concern. ""There's a constant risk with discarded fishing line, where people have cut off 50 or 100 metres at a time, they get wrapped in it. ""We've got a number of animals with amputated limbs because of it. ""It's not just the fishing hook, it's the fishing lines that they leave behind and the boat strikes.""   Mr McCosker hopes Yoda's release sends a message to those out on the water. ""Bring your rubbish home,"" he said.  ""Don't let the fishing line stay in the water, or the hooks or the crab pots. ""Fishing line; it's going to stay there for another 1,000 years so we've got that issue to face over a long, long time yet, so just be careful. Be mindful.""",ABC Capricornia      By Erin Semmler,"March 30, 2020"

Rockhampton resident Allan Reinikka is probably not the type of person who springs to mind when you think of pole dancing. But the 60-year-old, who has been hooked since he first took a lesson eight years ago, says there is really no reason men shouldn't participate in the sport. ""You don't have to be a skinny female to this — anyone, any shape, age, whatever — can actually do this stuff,"" Mr Reinikka said. ""I probably shouldn't be flipping upside down on poles, but it's good fun."" Mr Reinikka says he gets a few stares when he does public demonstrations, but mostly because people don't think of his body as being able to do the moves on the pole. As for the perception that pole dancing is just for women, Mr Reinikka has a theory. ""It's because it's a vertical pole,"" he said. ""If it was horizontal, everyone would treat it like it was gymnastics and it'd be completely different. ""And yes, it has its origins with strip clubs and it has been sexualised.""   The artwork hanging on Brady Neher's wall looks like a painting, featuring a skull on a colourful backdrop. On closer inspection, you see it has been painstakingly embroidered and is made up of several thousand tiny stitches. ""One thing I really love about this is the flow of the stitch,"" says Mr Neher, whose surname means tailor in German.   ""A lot of people say you must be really patient to be able to do something like this because it is time consuming and everything is very small. ""But it's not really patience because it's something I love to do. ""It also helps me maintain a stillness in my head and clears my mind — a meditation of sorts."" Mr Neher fell in love with cross-stitch through his parents. ""My mother first got me into cross-stitch, because I was a crafty kid and she got me to do a little cross-stitch design when I was about eight,"" he said.   Mr Neher's work is so unusual and intricate that it has been displayed in an exhibition at the local art gallery. ""The art is not so much the finished product — it's the actual human being sitting down, taking the time to create,"" he said. ""In my opinion, it's creating something pretty to add a little more beauty to the world.""   Drew Wickerson's cake decorating prowess has come a long way since he made a Thomas the Tank Engine cake for his son's fifth birthday nearly 30 years ago. Now his work is in such high demand that he has to carefully manage his time — by day he is a councillor in local government, and by night he is a cake wizard. One of the secrets to Cr Wickerson's success is the fact that he comes from an architectural and model background.   ""Because you always do drawings at a scale or build architectural models to scale, the design process is sort of the same,"" he said. ""Being a councillor is quite busy, so sometimes it's really nice to have a hobby that distracts you from the that. ""So just for a moment you lose yourself in making something that takes a fair bit of concentration and manual skill. ""And when you're doing that, you can block out your day at work."" The added bonus is that no-one is unhappy getting a cake, Cr Wickerson says. ""Whether it's something quite elaborate or even something quite basic, everyone smiles and I've never had an unhappy friend receive a cake,"" he said. As for Cr Wickerson's favourite cake, he says it's hard because once you finish one cake you move on to the next. He's created dragons, trucks, tanks, peacocks, and miniature buildings to commemorate anniversaries.   ""I did one that was huge, and it was for a commercial gardens opening,"" Cr Wickerson said. ""This thing took two grown men to pick it up, and I think it was something like 60 kilos, and that's a lot of weight for cake. It was massive."" One of his cakes, R2-D2 from Star Wars, even won a prize at the local agricultural show.  ""It's nice to make people smile,"" he said.",ABC Capricornia      By Inga Stunzner,"March 29, 2020"
44,/news/2020-03-29/coronavirus-covid-19-australian-writers-livelihoods/12093816, Coronavirus is threatening the livelihoods of Australian writers but there are ways you can support Australian writing,"Like hundreds of thousands of other Australians, Heather Rose — the author of the Stella Prize-winning Museum of Modern Love — spent two and a half hours on hold to Centrelink on Tuesday. The Tasmanian writer counts herself lucky though, with a relatively short wait time compared to others who called up, tried to use the Centrelink website, or waited in line to begin the process of claiming welfare payments. Rose had given up her usual teaching jobs to embark on a national and international tour to promote her latest novel, Bruny (Allen and Unwin) — but all those paid festival appearances and books events have now been cancelled as a result of coronavirus. ""This is my cash flow, this the income I was relying on,"" Rose says. That leaves her, a single mother with a dependent child, without income for the next few months. While many industries, particularly those with a casualised or self-employed workforce, are suffering, writers' lives are already precarious. ""This is a fairly long-suffering group in the arts generally, where incomes have been falling for years,"" says Olivia Lanchester, the CEO of the Australian Society of Authors. A 2015 Macquarie University study found that Australian writers earn on average $12,900 a year from their craft. ""This crisis has helped to expose maybe just how little generally writers earn,"" says Lanchester. Dozens of writers told RN's The Book Show about how their book events had been cancelled as a result of coronavirus, including Sydney-based novelist and freelance writer Liam Pieper. ""This is a really unprecedented and damaging time for everyone in the arts. It feels like we're mid-apocalypse,"" says Pieper.   Pieper was meant to be launching his latest book Sweetness and Light in Melbourne last week before going on a national book tour, but that won't be happening now. ""It's a little cataclysmic from a personal point of view, because you spend three or four years working on a book and then you get a very brief window to bid them bon voyage into the world,"" he says. The first few weeks after a book is published are key to a book reaching an audience. ""The book tour is really an indispensable part of publishing a book, it's a rare chance to meet readers and touch base with bookstores and shore up those relationships,"" says Pieper. Like most other writers and artists, he has other part-time jobs — but he says dozens of his freelance writing gigs have disappeared as a result of COVID-19, which means he will be mostly living off savings, while he can. ""I'm not sure what I'll do, but I will survive ... at least I have the option of the little work I still have, I can do from home. So I am aware of my blessings,"" says Pieper. The same week that Omar Sakr's poetry collection The Lost Arabs (University of Queensland Press) was shortlisted for a NSW Premier's Literary Award, his upcoming readings, panels, and writers festival appearances were all cancelled as a result of coronavirus. But what hurt him the most was the cancellation of a multi-city US book tour to promote the US edition of his collection. ""It's rare and difficult to get an international book deal as a poet, let alone an Australian poet, let alone a tour. I'd been working really hard to get to this point — and it's all fallen to pieces,"" Sakr says.   The Lost Arabs was published in Australia in May 2019. ""The first year or two after the book comes up you're typically heavily involved in literary festivals and things like that, and half of my income — if not more — has been coming from festivals and these kinds of events,"" says the poet. Sakr says that writers' incomes in the year that they sign book deals, or the year they release a book, might paint a pretty, but unrepresentative, picture — and render them ineligible for Centrelink. ""It might feel like you're doing OK [if you're at that point in the book cycle] but the next few years are typically abysmal,"" says Sakr. Claire G. Coleman was meant to be promoting The Old Lie (Hachette Australia), the follow-up to her Stella Prize-shortlisted novel Terra Nullius, at the Sydney Writers' Festival in May — but that's now been cancelled, along with a number of other appearances and artistic developments. She described what's been happening as a ""cancellation apocalypse"". ""It felt apocalyptic because all of us writers require these events to make a bit of money, but also to promote our books.""   As with Rose, Pieper and Sakr, Coleman has now lost income from event payments as well as the book sales that would have been boosted by those events. ""[And] for freelancers, our margins are quite small — so losing any money at all is really dramatic,"" Coleman says. Coleman counts herself lucky, as she's still got royalties and commissions and she wasn't trying to promote a newly released book, but she's worried about lost momentum. ""Every event you do, every project you do, builds interest in the next project you do ... to someone who is relatively early in their career that could mean a loss of future income greater than what I've lost already.""  Coleman, a Wirlomin Noongar woman, says she is particularly concerned for First Nations writers. ""We're only a very small segment of the industry, and except for the few big names, everyone is very new ... and we've already had it difficult, so that means the loss of momentum will hit us harder,"" she explains.   Playwright and filmmaker John Harding is a founding member of Ilbijerri Theatre Company and a board member of the First Nations Australia Writers Network. He's concerned about the potential impact of COVID-19 on elders. ""You're looking at possible devastation for remote and regional communities and we have just a handful of elders left that are the custodians and keepers of knowledge ... and these people are writers too,"" Harding says. Harding asks: ""Who is protecting these communities?"" The Australian Society of Authors is a professional association of Australian authors and illustrators with over 3,000 members. CEO Olivia Lanchester agrees that authors who have had to cancel appearances and launches will be most directly impacted by COVID-19, but says other writers will feel impacts further down the track. Lanchester says that ""we really don't know yet the effect on royalties,"" because royalties are paid to authors biannually, in March and August: ""We won't see the impact on authors for six months at least.""   And she says that while booksellers have reported strong sales as readers rush to stock up for quarantine, it's likely that bookstores will be forced to close at some point. Publishers, particularly the smaller independent presses, will also be vulnerable.  Heather Rose, who is still completing the process of applying for government support, describes herself as a ""job waiter, not a job seeker. I'm waiting for my industry to pick up again, I'm waiting for future royalties, to do my job out there in the world again."" ""The latest government stimulus is welcome and does assist in protecting the most vulnerable writers, which is great, but I think it would be good to have sector-specific funding now,"" Lanchester says. Lanchester and many other stakeholders would like to see an increase in funding for the Australia Council of the Arts, the federal government's arts funding body. Government per capita spending on the arts and culture has been in decline, and writing and literature has been neglected by the Australia Council, with only 2.7% of its total funding going to this area. The Australia Council has recently announced a COVID-19 response package that includes $5 million of the council's own ""uncommitted funds from this financial year"", now directed towards immediate relief for Australian artists, arts workers and arts organisations. Lanchester also suggests that the government bring forward the annual payments for PLR (Public Lending Right) and ELR (Educational Lending Right) — the royalties that the government pays to writers for their works held in libraries and schools. She's also recommending that the government extend PLR and ELR to cover digital versions of books, as readers in social isolation will be primarily accessing books digitally.   ""This is a really scary time, right now, for writers,"" says Carly Findlay, author of the memoir Say Hello (HarperCollins, 2019) and the editor of upcoming anthology Growing Up Disabled in Australia (2021, Black Inc. Books). ""It's really important to help writers at this time, and help the writing industry too,"" says Findlay. Findlay told RN's The Book Show that there are a number of ways that people, while in social isolation and depending on their financial circumstances, can support writers and the industry.   ""Tell a writer that you're thinking of us. It's a really scary time, but I think that reading and writing will get us through this,"" Findlay says. Heather Rose says quarantine or isolation ""is a beautiful time to get to know our country better, our history better, your local place better, and get to know Australian writers better."" While libraries are closed, you can still access ebooks and audiobooks from home. And bookshops are still operating at time of writing, with many offering free delivery.  ""If you can do it, our message is please buy our books,"" Omar Sakr says. Coleman urges readers to buy books from local independent bookstores in particular: ""Otherwise they won't be there at the end of this."" Harding asks those who are concerned about Indigenous writers to consider donating to the First Nations Australia Writers Network, as they'll be finding ways to support their writers through the pandemic. If you'd like to support a particular author, many writers have details of ways to directly donate on their social media or websites — for example, you can follow #coughupforafreelancer on Twitter and you'll find writers seeking support.  Sakr has started posting videos of himself reading his poetry on Twitter under the #InternationalPoetryCircle, as a way to find an audience for the US edition of The Lost Arabs. ""Reading my poems out loud is a joy, and I think we're going to need as much of that as possible,"" says Sakr.   Some bookstores are moving their writers' events online — including Brisbane's Avid Reader bookstore, which will host a virtual book launch for Liam Pieper's Sweetness and Light on March 30. ""It's heartening to see the arts community scramble to find ways to stay vital and provide entertainment to people who need it more now than ever,"" says Pieper.

It is the first job for the former Suits television series actress since she and Prince Harry announced in January that they were stepping down from their Royal duties, seeking to pursue greater financial independence.   The documentary, entitled Elephant, follows an elephant family on a 1,600-kilometre journey across the Kalahari Desert and will raise money for the charity Elephants without Borders. It will be released on April 3 via the Disney+ streaming service as one of a series of animal and nature-themed features released to mark Earth Month. Britain's Sun newspaper reported this week that Harry and Meghan have moved to Los Angeles, where they plan to make a permanent home. They had been living for several months with their son Archie on Vancouver Island in Canada.   A spokeswoman for Prince Harry declined to comment on the report, which The Sun dubbed as an exclusive. Meghan was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother Doria still lives there. People magazine, citing an unidentified source, said on Thursday the couple had already settled into a home in the Los Angeles area and had not ventured out.    Last week, the United States and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus. California imposed a state-wide stay-at-home order last week in a bid to contain the coronavirus. Harry's father Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, tested positive to the coronavirus this week. The grandson of Queen Elizabeth II married American actress Meghan at Windsor Castle in May 2018, in a ceremony watched by millions around the world.  The couple later said they found scrutiny by the British media — which they said tipped into harassment — intolerable. The couple will cease their royal duties at the end of March as they carve out ""a progressive new role,"" mainly based in North America, which they aim to finance themselves.

46,/news/2020-03-29/coronavirus-why-we-read-romance-fiction-in-a-crisis/12097592,Romance fiction got us through the GFC and World War II. Here's why it could help us during COVID-19,"When it comes to literary genres, romance fiction often gets a bad rap — usually for being too sappy, unrealistic and predictable.   But those criticisms are precisely why people turn to romance literature in times of crisis, according to Jodi McAlister, lecturer in writing, literature and culture at Deakin University. ""In a romance novel, you always know how it's going to turn out in the end and it's going to turn out well,"" she said. ""A romance novel has to have a happy ending — that's one of its defining features.  ""And in times like this, when everything is really uncertain and we're not quite sure what's going to happen, we love that sense of closure. ""We like knowing that the arc of the universe will bend towards emotional justice, where two people who love each other will end up together."" Dr McAlister says, far from being a setback, the mandatory happy ending is a feature that makes romance fiction a comforting, hopeful genre. And you would never hear the criticism of a predictable ending being flung at a crime novel — although the grisly murder is always solved by the book's conclusion.   Despite romance authors being some of the most successful in the world — United States author, Nora Roberts, owns two mountains and half a town — Dr McAlister said the genre has been dogged by sexism, and has been largely undervalued, for centuries. While researching her PhD, Dr McAlister found a letter to the editor sent to a London newspaper in 1730, which claimed that ""romances ruined more virgins than masquerades and brothels"".   ""There's this anxiety, a lot of the time, about what women read,"" she said. Despite being the unsung hero of the literary world, romance fiction has come to the rescue of readers, and the industry, in times of crisis. ""During World War II Mills & Boon, the famous romance publisher, made a successful argument that they should maintain their paper rations because their books were good for morale for women working in the factories,"" Dr McAlister said. In modern day upheavals, such as during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, romance fiction came to the fore again. ""During the financial crisis in the 21st century the sales of a lot of books went down,"" Dr McAlister said. ""It was a real crisis moment for publishing and the thing that kept the entire publishing industry afloat was romance fiction. ""Those sales actually went up — not even pornography can claim that."" As a general rule, if it exists there is a romance novel about it, says Dr McAlister. Once you find what you like, you will find the right subgenre for you, including for queer and gender-diverse readers.    ""My favourite example of how big the romance genre is, is that there's a book called Amish Vampires in Space,"" Dr McAlister said. For those new to the genre, she recommended work by New Zealand romance author, Lucy Parker, who has written a series about actors on London's West End, and Australian romance authors like Ainslie Paton and Anne Gracie. ""We have a wealth of romance writers in Australia that people don't really know about,"" Dr McAlister said. ""You wouldn't recognise a famous author, even though they're probably the ones driving sales."" Rowland Thomson owns Melbourne bookshop and cafe, Hares & Hyenas, which caters to the queer community. He said he has been selling a broad range of books over the past few weeks and had not noticed a spike in people's interest in romance novels yet, but in general they were more popular online.   ""People tend to read them so quickly that they're more commonly sold as ebooks,"" Mr Thomson said. ""They buy them by the dozen."" He said since the public has been increasingly concerned about the coronavirus pandemic, book series have been selling well. ""People are looking for long reads and to get invested in a series over a long period of time,"" Mr Thomson said. ""They're also buying quite a bit of young adult fiction and even kids picture books to keep kids distracted while they're in lockdown.""

47,/news/2020-03-29/how-architecture-is-an-ideological-battlefield/12081324,Architecture is an ideological battlefield. Will Trump 'Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again'?,"In a busy year for Donald Trump, as he stares down the barrel of a pandemic, an election, and possible global recession, he'll have to prioritise the demands of his entourage. One that hangs in the balance is a call to ""Make Federal Buildings Beautiful Again"". An executive order drafted for the Trump administration, leaked to Architectural Record last month, would mandate all future federal government buildings be designed in ""classical architectural style"". The draft specifically targets brutalism and deconstructivism as examples of the ""just plain ugly"" modern architecture that plagues the built landscape of the United States. In lieu of this modernist ""ugliness"", the draft invokes the ""classical architecture of democratic Athens and republican Rome"" as more appropriate expressions of America's ""self-governing ideals"". So why is architecture such an ideological battlefield? And what makes the classical style so appealing to culture warriors on the right?   Last month's draft order was initiated by the National Civic Art Society -- a non-profit think tank that's disapproved of US government buildings for decades. In it, they cite several examples of ""beautiful and beloved buildings"" that take design cues from classic Greece and Rome, including:   They contrast these older buildings with a handful of low-rise brutalist office blocks constructed in the 60s and 70s, which, they say, ""inspired public derision instead of admiration"":    The White House has not commented on the proposal, but many architects have reacted with dismay. In an open letter and petition, the American Institute of Architects strongly condemned ""the move to enforce a top-down directive on architectural style"". ""Design decisions should be left to the designer and the community, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC,"" this letter says. ""All architectural styles have value and all communities have the right to weigh in on the government buildings meant to serve them."" This is far from the first time that architectural preferences have been used for political ends. The neoclassical trend swept through the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries during a critical period of the country's development, as thinkers turned to the ancient Greeks and Romans for lessons on how democracies should operate. By the early 20th century, however, neoclassicism was being taken up by rising powers less interested in democracy. One example comes from Nazi Germany, where Adolf Hitler's chief architect, Albert Speer, invoked Roman imperial splendour with buildings like the monumentalist Nuremberg Stadium.   ""I read in Goethe's Travels in Italy that, when he saw the Roman amphitheatre in Verona, he said to himself: if people with different minds are all pressed together in such a place, they will be unified in one mind,"" Speer once remarked. ""That was the idea of the stadium; it had nothing to do with what the small man might think personally."" Architecture, Speer understood, offered a potent medium through which to articulate Nazi ideology. His monumental, anonymous facades were intended to reinforce cultural continuity, collective uniformity and to provide a symbolic frame for the monolithic Nazi state. In more recent times, there's been a growing chorus of nativist demagogues seeking to revive classical architecture as an ideological instrument in a long-running culture war. The problem, according to Tim Verlaan, an assistant professor in urban history at the University of Amsterdam, is that the meanings of beauty, ugliness and indeed classicism are ambiguous.   ""I think what the right's doing now is referring back to the 19th century -- a century in which [they believe] Europe ... was still a predominantly white continent and was still ruling the seas,"" he tells ABC RN's Blueprint. ""It's a sort of nostalgia for a past that has never been."" Those lobbying Trump, then, are advocating a return not so much to classicism but 19th century neoclassicism, a counterpoint to modernism's supposed intellectual, cosmopolitan pretentions. This critique, Verlaan argues, is riddled with inconsistencies. ""I think there is a lot of hypocrisy involved here because if you look at what Donald Trump built himself -- what he designed as a property developer -- that's all pseudo-modernism,"" he says. And so the idea that groups within his entourage would now be advocating for neoclassicism, he says, is ""a bit strange"". Similarly, many of today's culture warriors are as vague about what constitutes modern architecture as they are about the alterative. One example given by Verlaan is YouTube crusader and conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson, author of the video Why Modern Architecture SUCKS. ""They conflate modernism and post-modernism ... basically everything that was built after the beginning of the 20th century is wrong in their eyes,"" Verlaan says. ""They don't really have a sense ... of what the two architectural styles actually mean and what they stem from. ""Most modern buildings were built during the zenith of the welfare state, at least in Western Europe, so ... it's also a backlash against big government rolling out those housing programs in the 1950s and 60s and 70s. ""[Today] those housing estates are ... in some areas ... populated by migrants so I think there is also a connection here between this hatred [of] modernist architecture and also the people living there."" In Germany, supporters of the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) are seeking to revive Saxon mythology and its rural castles as a corrective to what they view as the degenerate, modern architecture of German cities. ""For the AfD it is very much the countryside that they long for,"" says Verlaan. ""To those rightist movements, the countryside has always [signified] something better than the cities; cities breed social problems, they are the places where you will find socialists, communists, and the countryside is this pastoral idyll that they actually embrace."" To Verlaan, architecture is inherently and necessarily political. Amanda Kolson Hurley, an architecture critic and author, argues that the use of architectural style in the service of a culture war obscures the principles and qualities that underpin architecture. In her view, classicism and modernism are not opposites that we must choose between, but rather exist on a continuum. She believes elitism, exclusion and alienation are no more inherent in modernism than in neoclassicism.   The oft-cited ""anti-human"" character of brutalist social housing, for example, has been disproven, she says. ""A lot of the most dysfunctional social housing projects in the modernist or brutalist style stem from a lack of management and maintenance,"" she told RN in 2017. ""It was not inherently the architecture that you can point to explain why a building failed."" Architecture, she acknowledges, will always elicit powerful reactions because it is ""an enveloping environment"". ""We are experiencing it in three dimensions, we're moving through it, it [surrounds] us. ""A painting you can just walk away from, a sculpture you can turn your back on, but it's really hard to do that with a building or a public space.""

48,/news/2020-03-29/bob-dylan-and-johnny-cash-singer-songwriter-rock-star/12091824,How the sensitive singer-songwriter was born and changed music forever,"When Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash sat down in February 1969 to make music together they had one small problem. What would they play? Cash looked across at Dylan and said, ""What about we play Girl from the North Country?"". Dylan looked coy, ""I don't think I can play that one Johnny"". The reason was unclear. Certainly Dylan's use of amphetamines had taken the edge off his prodigious memory but more likely the ever forward looking Dylan didn't fancy dragging up a song from his back catalogue.   Not to be denied, Cash persisted and slowly coaxed Dylan into a country-styled remake of an achingly beautiful song of loss and regret. Released later that year as the opening track to the album Nashville Skyline, the song was a key offering on an LP focused on love and the virtues of country living.  Not only did Dylan shock the world with his embrace of country music, he also set the template for a new genre of music: the sensitive singer-songwriter. In his book Hearts of Darkness: the Unlikely Rise of the Singer-Songwriter, author Dave Thompson chronicles the remarkable blossoming of this new music as the decade turned. It was a music that replaced volume with melody, posturing with intimacy, and city with country. For the next two years it would dominate the music charts. What Thompson makes clear is the extraordinary way this new movement grew, as if by magic, in so many parts of the world.   As we now know, even as Dylan was sitting down with Cash in Nashville, a young singer named Cat Stevens was having his own moment of revelation in London. For much of the 1960s Stevens had been a man in a hurry to become a star. He'd had hits, Matthew and Son and I Love My Dog.  But in 1968 he been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Spending three months in hospital he emerged from his solitude with a new view of the world. As 1969 progressed he sensed a change in himself and the audience. Like Dylan he decided less was more.  Asked to play as the support act for the incendiary rock band The Who, Stevens took the stage with just an acoustic guitar. The promotors were appalled.  The crowd loved it. Asked about this new approach he simply said. ""The quieter you play the more people will listen"". It was a philosophy that in less than a year would make him a superstar. Across the Atlantic, at almost exactly the same time, young songwriter by the name of James Taylor was also trying to pick up the pieces of a faltering career. Depressed and addicted to heroin, Taylor had been admitted to hospital.  Released, but still struggling with his addiction, the experience had sparked him to write a song about a woman he'd met in recovery, who'd later taken her own life. Titled Fire and Rain, Taylor had been toying with it for almost a year.  Then in late 1969 his producer Peter Asher listening to a demo recording of the piece had an epiphany. Get rid of the layered instruments. Create a musical setting that made the listener think it was simply Taylor and his guitar playing for them, with all other instruments playing in support roles.   Released in February 1970 the song with its chilling opening line ""just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone"" announced a new decade had truly begun, a new type of artist had arrived. An artist who exposed the intimate elements of their life in song. Club owner Doug Weston, who ran LA's Troubadour Club, put it succinctly when asked why he'd booked people like Taylor saying, ""people were sick of music that looked outward all the time. They want to hear what was on the inside too"". If intimacy was the goal, no-one was more capable of revelation than Joni Mitchell.  Canadian born but now a resident of Laurel Canyon in LA, she was already the author of songs that had quickly become standards. Even more fearless artistically than Taylor she had never been afraid to bare her soul in song. Now the world had caught up   As if to complete the circle, just as Taylor hit the big time, the pair became lovers. He wrote about her and she wrote about him. The result? A series of songs that formed her album Blue.  As Mitchell well knew this was her inner soul on display. ""At that period of my life, I had no personal defences. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes."" In Los Angeles another Canadian by the name of Neil Young, was also battling to balance fame with artistic instinct. Yes, he was part of one of the biggest selling acts in music but none of that made him artistically happy.  Ever the loner, Young would think nothing of getting in his van and driving between gigs. Now he wanted that person on record.  Taking time off the road Young gathered a few friends in his home studio and set to working making his own album.   Taking inspiration from a film script written by his pal Dean Stockwell, Young began writing a soundtrack for the intended movie. The centre-piece was the song After the Goldrush that would in turn give the album its title.  Panned by the critics on its release the record was devoured by music buyers who revelled in its fragility. For the music industry it was clear pain had a payoff and no-one was more aware of it than Doug Weston as he watched his Troubadour Club fill up each night with people wanting to hear Young bare his soul, ""a solo songwriter singing songs about his own life, his own pain, his own thoughts Before people wrote about bigger issues following Dylan's lead. Dylan rarely sang directly about his own life, he may have inserted it into his lyrics but he did not openly discuss it"". And here was the conundrum for this new group of artists.  In exposing their inner lives they had reformed their relationship with their audience.  Understandably, according to Dave Thompson, the fans began to believe they knew the performers. The problem for the artist was that ultimately such scrutiny was near impossible to live with. As James Taylor said of his newfound fame: ""I don't enjoy selling myself. They (the fans) want to know what I read and what I'm like, and I don't really know myself."" Cat Stevens too was unprepared for the scrutiny, ""they try to make too much of my songs. I don't know why I write them. But they try and find all kinds of hidden meanings…"" But if Taylor, Mitchell and Stevens were having second thoughts about fame built on intimacy that fear wasn't transferred to a hungry batch of artists waiting for their shot at the big time, nor the record executives that lined up to sign up their very own singer songwriter. In the rush for gold many nuggets were unearthed. Kris Kristofferson, Randy Newman and Jackson Browne to name a few. Established songwriters too suddenly became stars in their own right including Carole King, whose album Tapestry sold a staggering three million copies. As record executives rushed to sign a new batch of would be Taylors and Mitchells though, the wheel was already turning. Knitted jumpers, laid back sounds and confessional song-writing was starting to become its own straight-jacket and even worse, it was quickly becoming a cliche. Song-writer and scenester Kim Fowley put it best when he said, ""What caused glam rock? Simple: James Taylor, saggy tits and granola ... all kinds of men and women sitting on stools wearing overalls and flower print dresses singing about Laurel canyon. It was horrifying, it wasn't rock and roll"".   He was right. By 1972 the biggest star in the firmament was David Bowie in the form of Ziggy Stardust.  Glam rock was the new wonder child and singer songwriters were fighting for their place in world. In time music would visit the Dark Side of the Moon, hear men singing in very high voices ""Staying Alive"" and catch full blown disco fever. The big wheel had turned and it would keep on turning.

49,/news/2020-03-29/what-would-bandit-do-parents-bluey-coronavirus/12092010,'What would Bandit do?' I'm taking parenting cues from Bluey to get through the coronavirus pandemic,"As a parent, it's obligatory to begin most sentences with ""as a parent"". Also, as a parent, it's incumbent on me to be in a state of vague panic approximately all of the time. Evolution has programmed our dumb mammal brains to be hypervigilant about the wellbeing of our little bundles of species-future, and thus even the most cavalier laugh-in-the-face-of-death sort of person will turn to jelly at the thought of something happening to their child.  My own first few months of parenthood involved a ridiculous amount of checking on whether my son was still breathing, which was tiresome when he was sleeping and downright weird when he was actively moving around and squawking at me.    So I had no shortage of things to be worried about when the coronavirus pandemic began. As a father of two kids it would be very easy to go into a permanent state of ""helicopter parent panic"" right now. But then my anxiety about the present collided with my anxiety about the future.    What if my anxiousness about COVID-19 is passed on to my boys, who are too young to understand exactly what's going on but definitely old enough to pick up on Dad's stress and worry and absorb it into their fertile little brains?    Won't that just be exacerbated if we go into weeks of lockdown where Dad represents a quarter of the population of our family's tiny new planet? And so I did what any right-thinking Australian father would do. I asked myself, ""What would Bandit do?"" Because here's the thing about the ABC's beloved children's show, Bluey: it's probably the single most ideal portrayal of early childhood parenting on television, despite its characters being animated dogs.  Not only is it wildly entertaining for parents to watch with children, the overwhelming lesson Bluey instils is that it's OK to put everything aside for a bit and just play with our kids.    Scratch that: it reminds us that it's downright important for us to throw ourselves into play, because first, that is how children learn and second, our kids look to their parents as models for their own behaviour.  I was hit particularly hard by the closing scene of the episode Takeaway, in which a frustrated Bandit (Bluey's dad) realises that even those stressful moments with kids acting up are fleeting, and decides to go all-in on mucking around with them.  What dad hasn't been tempted away from doing work to re-enact Raiders of the Lost Ark with a yoga ball down a hallway instead? In other words, if adults are scared and snappy and withdrawn because we've just spent 40 minutes scrolling through coronavirus-related news, our children are going to notice, and assume that is the right way to respond to the people around them.   And I don't want my kids to be scared. I want them to feel like Mum and Dad have got this, even if Mum and Dad aren't nearly as confident about that themselves. So I calmed down, took a deep breath, and used it to inflate a balloon for a spirited game of Keepy Uppy.    My wife Dee and I also made a quiet promise to each other to celebrate this peculiar moment in history, despite everything, because it's giving us hours with our young family which we'd never have the opportunity to enjoy otherwise.  As it happens, as I was writing this, Dee and I were playing our 13 month-old son's current favourite game — rolling a ping pong ball across the kitchen floor and laughing wildly at it — when he abruptly stood and took his first proper steps.   That's a moment we could easily have missed, were the circumstances less ... unique. I know this is a thread of silver lining within a massive, foreboding thunderhead. I'm acutely aware that the coming weeks are going to be difficult and challenging, even in the best-case scenario.  Money's going to be tight, the future's uncertain, and I don't even want to contemplate how the virus could potentially affect us, our extended family, our friends and our community once transmission rates peak — although I do, constantly, as I'm trying to go to sleep.  But if Bluey and Bingo have taught me anything it's that their parents would want them to know they were loved and safe no matter what happened, and the best way to make forced isolation bearable is to turn it into a wonderful game.  So that's what we're going to do. And I feel that Bandit and Chilli would approve. Andrew P Street is a freelance writer.    ",By Andrew P Street,"March 29, 2020"
50,/news/2020-03-28/why-we-love-to-consume-crime/12095988,From crime fiction to true crime: Why we can't get enough of the genre,"If you're settling in for a good social distancing crime binge this weekend, you're not alone. Just when you thought the world had probably had enough of true crime documentaries, Netflix has released a seven-part series about a tiger owner named Joe Exotic and an animal activist named Carole Baskin. It's a captivating story, and it has everything — murder, mystery, hit men, lies, seduction. Despite only being online for a week, it has already been binge-watched around the globe, with many describing it as the perfect antidote to quarantine. You would be forgiven for thinking that, in a news cycle that has been getting increasingly darker, people would turn to light entertainment to find refuge and comfort. But crime continues to be one of the most widely-consumed genres for men and women alike — thanks in part to the many mediums we can now consume it on. Between podcasts, streaming services, YouTube channels and good old-fashioned paperback books, crime has embraced every entertainment platform and, as such, the genre is showing no signs of going anywhere. ""People are controlling the kind of media they are consuming now, and crime is more accessible than ever,"" Emily Webb from the Australian True Crime podcast said. ""You control what you stream, what you read. ""Crime is also much broader than murder. It's also about fraud, grifters, the social side of things.  ""Crime is human experience and drama at its most intense. I find it fascinating.""   Indeed, Webb is not alone in her fascination. Her podcast, co-hosted by Meshel Laurie, has just hit its 150th episode and attracts well over one million listeners each month. Such was the interest in crime at Apple Podcasts that they created a separate True Crime category last year. The ABC's Unravel true crime podcast, Snowball, topped charts and garnered critical acclaim upon its release in mid-2019. ""Podcasting is just really accessible,"" Webb said. ""Quite a few truck drivers message us. We had two ladies come to a show once who had opened a cleaning business, and they said they listen to podcasts all the time while working. ""I probably listen more to podcasts than television streaming, because I don't really have time to sit down in front of the television."" Even though podcasts might be a more accessible way to consume crime, their popularity has also had a significant influence on what we watch on television. Podcasts are regularly turned into television series — Dirty John was a podcast before it was a Netflix hit; to that end, so was the aforementioned Tiger King. And speaking of Netflix, the streaming giant has already released 10 true-crime series so far this year — despite us being only three months in — and later in 2020 will release Into the Deep, a documentary about the murder of journalist Kim Wall, made by Australian filmmaker Emma Sullivan. Over in the land of free-to-air television, Law and Order: SVU became the longest-running US live action series last year, after it entered its 21st season. And who could forget countless Sunday nights spend watching Midsomer Murders — which is still on-air — with your grandparents? So what is it about this genre that strikes a chord with so many people? It's all part of human nature, according to Rachel Franks, Conjoint Fellow at the University of Newcastle's School of Humanities and Social Science. ""In a sense, crime is timeless. It's something that we think can impact everybody, and now that it's so easy to consume and distribute, it validates these conversations and interests,"" she said. ""There's also the reassurance that, even in crime, there are good people out there, like law enforcement, doing everything they can to make society better. ""Those kinds of things are innate to human nature.""   Dr Franks — an expert in crime fiction, true crime and pop culture — also said that people crave ""some sort of resolution"" which can be found within the crime genre. ""They like looking for an answer, about who did this, why they did this — even if sometimes that can be beyond anyone's comprehension,"" she said. ""Whereas hundreds of years ago everyone was looking to God to make them safer or to punish those who did the wrong thing, today it's quite a different system of who is going to look after us. ""People are looking for more secular-based answers, or answers from each other. And when we read crime novels or true crime cases, we feed this desire. We find people who are working hard to make society better; someone else to put their faith in."" These factors are what makes crime fiction so appealing, too. ""True crime, even in the best examples, is messy,"" Dr Franks said. ""In reading true crime we're learning about crime in society, and what we would do if we were in that situation. ""In crime fiction readers like the idea of a puzzle, like the characters that emerge, but they don't really want their victims to be real. There's a comfortable distance. ""There's something almost restful about reading something like Agatha Christie — the characters are predictable, there's a formula, there is a trust that there will be a resolution. There's a neat ending."" Indeed, Agatha Christie is still one of the best-selling authors of all time, despite her first book being published in 1920. Looking to contemporary charts, at its February debut J.D. Robb's Golden In Death topped the New York Times' Best Sellers list — remarkable, not because J.D Robb is a pseudonym for Nora Roberts, but because the book is the 50th in her series about Detective Eve Dallas. And, the current top download on both the free and the paid charts in the Kindle store are both crime fiction books.   Rose is a 22 year old student, and an avid consumer of crime across several platforms. ""My favourite thing would be podcasts, often ones in real-time about ongoing cases, particularly missing persons, cases — they intrigue me the most,"" Rose said. ""With any other genre, you're enjoying it but you're still removed. With true crime, you know it's happened. It's a whole other level. ""I listen when I'm running. I use it as a treat or as a motivation to make the next 5km."" Alongside podcasts, Rose also watches ""random documentaries on YouTube about cases that are still open or being solved,"" and reads a lot of crime fiction. ""There's just a lot of it out there,"" she said, citing Robert Galbraith — a pseudonym of J.K. Rowling — and Australian author Christian White as favourites. ""I love detective stories, things with twists — I'm not into the gory side of it at all. ""With crime fiction, you get to be put into the shoes of the person investigating. You can go beyond the red tape, get to solve the problem without the trauma of being in it yourself."" A 2017 study by Macquarie University found that crime fiction still ""dominates people's preferences"" when it comes to buying books, and figures place female consumers between 60 to 80 per cent. ""Women for a very long time have liked crime stories,"" Dr Franks agreed. ""Then in the earlier 20th century lots of women actually became crime writers. ""As formats change and become more easily available and easier to consume, the stigmas around reading true crime or crime fiction have been reduced."" Spotify's data shows female listeners of true-crime podcasts increased by 16 per cent in 2019. Of the top 5 podcasts hosted by women so far in 2020, four are about crime. While Webb and Laurie's Australian True Crime podcast has only a slightly higher female skew, their Facebook page is dominated by females, at 85 per cent. ""My perspective is that, for one thing, women and girls grow up conditioned to be a bit fearful about their safety. I certainly feel like I was brought up having to have an awareness of personal safety,"" Webb said. ""So I think women are drawn to these things to try and work out how to be safe. ""We can all relate to things within the crime genre — relationships, family, drama, the social impact of crime, especially when we're talking about people who have been personally affected. ""People can seem normal but do really horrible things. With our podcast we can give people a platform to talk about their experiences. That's very powerful.""",By Kate Midena,"March 28, 2020"

She has been sent videos of people singing her coronavirus chant for kids on balconies in Italy.  And the BBC interviewed her by phone, from her kitchen, in her home near Wynyard in north-west Tasmania.

In the video she sang:  ""Every little cell in my body is happy, every little cell in my body is well … "" She said of the chant, ""I made a post, just encouraging parents to sing the song around the house"". ""They don't have to explain to the kids what it's about, or even [get them] to join in,"" Ms Davies said.  ""And when we have a catchy tune like that stuck in our head or we sing it over and over, it helps our nervous system to regulate. ""So my post was just to show how a little song can support anxiety management, but it's gone nuts! Millions of people have seen it."" The tune Allison used just sprang from her memory and, as far as she can determine, was derived from a parody of a tune written by Carl Anthony in the 1980s.     The Every Little Cell chant has been translated into multiple languages by families singing it to each other and trying to stay calm in dark times. But words aside, the therapist said some of the universal power and reach of music as therapy was because elements like melody, rhythm and repetition were key to activating positive brain function. ""When we experience melody, it activates more of our brain than any other thing that research has shown us,"" Ms Davies said. ""When we experience anxiety or dis-regulation or we're in survival mode, generally our pre-frontal cortex kind of switches off.  ""And that's the part of the brain that we need to work so we can analyse what's going on right now, make decisions and stay calm.""   Easier to grasp is the effect melody has on the emotional centre of the brain.  As Ms Davies puts it, you only need to have seen some musical theatre or a Hollywood movie to know melody can swing a mood. ""When we sing really simple little tunes, we can move emotions through us so they don't become pent up,"" she said. ""A bonus is that when we sing, it's an outbreath. A chant creates a nice controlled inbreath and out again through singing. ""And when we sing something over and over, we are creating a sense of predictability. ""At a time like this when routine is out the door, singing allows us to have some predictability in our environment."" Above all else, Ms Davies said, music has a great power to make people feel connected. The song also caught the attention of Melbourne film producer Diana Fisk, who has put together a video, showing people singing the song in different parts of the world. ""The song really caught my ear and eye and I just wanted to spread the love of the song by helping out with a bit of editing,"" Ms Fisk said.    After training through the Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy in Canada, Ms Davies has worked in many areas of home and hospital-based therapy, from bonding parents and children through rhythm and song to helping juvenile detainees and stroke victims. ""I work predominantly with people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury and we use music or singing, specifically, to rehabilitate speech,"" Ms Davies said.   Growing up in a house full of music — her brother and mother were both musicians while her father passed on his passion for music appreciation — music was always big in Ms Davies' life. Used to people suggesting that her time in training might have paid more had she aspired to be a more conventional health professional, she said her instinct from the start was that she had found her path. ""My motivation didn't come from the career prospects — it came from my passion for music and for working with people and helping them,"" she said.

52,/news/2020-03-28/bushfire-renewal-inspires-landscape-painter-warwick-fuller/12084608,Bushfire renewal inspires top Australian painter Warwick Fuller to find beauty in ashes,"As the first strains of light appeared on blackened gum trees, artist Warwick Fuller was in position at his easel, capturing the emerging dawn in paint. ""To me, the best light is morning and afternoon, early and late,"" he said. ""It's when you get really lovely effects happening; it's when you get gorgeous colours; you get light cutting through at angles on foliage and timber and rocks that you wouldn't get in the day time.""   The 72-year-old was in the Wolgan Valley in New South Wales, painting the aftermath of the devastating Gospers Mountain fire, which burned through 500,000 hectares of bush over the summer. It's an area he had often visited in a career spanning 40 years.   ""It's a beautiful place to paint, there's so much diversity of landscape here,"" he said. ""At the moment it's been really harshly dealt with by the recent summer bushfires but that's recovering now very nicely. ""I'm amazed that it's recovering and it can recover the way it does, but I'm concerned that these fires are getting hotter and longer and more often and I wonder how long it can keep recovering."" On his recent painting expedition, green shoots covered the burned trunks of trees throughout the valley, new grass was emerging and the ancient sandstone bluffs, which had inspired him for decades, were a strange mix of colours. They reflected renewal amidst the destruction caused by a fire which burned for three months. ""Light is what really drives me, it's what makes me want to paint the landscape but on top of that I'm trying to interpret what's deeper than just the physical surrounds, the physical objects in the landscape,"" Fuller said. ""When I look at the landscape, you get all sorts of feelings, emotions — something that's beyond the physical image. ""It's that emotional contact I have, that emotional response I get from the landscape, I'm always trying to find ways of interpreting that where that really shows in my work.""   Fuller's work is in collections all over the world, including that of the Prince of Wales, who has 14 of his paintings. The future monarch has invited Fuller to join his last three royal tours of Australia as official tour artist. ""His Royal Highness does generally take a tour artist with him wherever he goes in Australia or any other country,"" Fuller said. ""It's a tradition he's carried on from back in the days before there was photography and other means of recording things.""   From April, the Penrith Regional Gallery in Western Sydney had hoped to celebrate Fuller's career with a four-month survey exhibition of his work. It would have been his first public exhibition, but has been postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis.  The gallery's director Sheona White said paintings were being sourced from private collections spanning the artist's entire career. She said his work was in the tradition of the Heidelberg School of impressionist painting, made famous by great Australian artists such as Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin in the late 1800s and early 1900s. ""He's taken that style and developed it into something that's got tradition but it's also got a beautiful contemporary look, looking at landscape, looking at nature, understanding light,"" Ms White said.   She said the Australian landscape painting tradition was incredibly strong. ""I think it will remain strong,"" she said. ""I don't think it's finished at all but there's a whole range of different forms of landscape, different ways of responding to the landscape and of course, as this summer has just shown us, we are in a very different relationship to our natural world now. ""I think that's causing a great deal of reflection, certainly with Warwick, and he's really interesting the way he's working with this subject of what's going on with nature now."" Fuller said he was disappointed the exhibition would not go ahead, but he stressed it was not a retrospective as he considered his career in full swing.   ""As long as I can paint, I'll keep painting,"" he said. ""I love painting, I don't think I'll get sick of it. ""I don't know what I love about the Australian bush, I just love it; I love every aspect of it, I love its nuances. ""You could look at the same area with the same four or five or six colours and paint a thousand paintings and they'd all be different and they'd all have something else, something new to say. ""It's just incredible what can be done out there in the landscape.""   Watch this story on ABC TV's Landline on Sunday at 12:30pm or on iView.",Landline      By Sean Murphy,"March 28, 2020"
53,/news/2020-03-28/kids-children-books-diverse-stories-what-to-read/12003236,These children's books help kids embrace difference and diversity in themselves and others,"I look at my kids' library and wonder what my life would've been like if I'd had access to their selection of books growing up.  As a dark-skinned, Melanesian Pacific Islander kid growing up in Melbourne's eastern suburbs I was constantly aware that my family and I were the only black family — and very obviously so — living in the area.  I grew up in Camberwell, a polite, well-to-do and very Anglocentric community in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. We weren't rich by any means but my father had a respectable job within Radio Australia at the ABC and as with many migrant parents, he and my mother wanted to make sure we got the best opportunities possible when it came to public school education. My school had a few East Asian and South Asian families but insofar as other noticeably black families, we were it. Us. Just us. It's a cliche, but there's a reason why the saying ""you can't be what you can't see"" resonates for many.   Even travelling with my family to Papua New Guinea, I will never get over the thrill of seeing faces that look like mine in cheesy advertisements, presenting current affairs and news on prime time national TV and splashed across all forms of media outlets.  But for my kids, they didn't bat an eyelid. In fact, I'm not sure they'd realise this was a thing.  A huge part of this is that there's not been an ongoing absence of their imagery — a reflection deficit — in their life. They attend a school where other kids look like them, have similar cultural aesthetics; they have the internet to see folks they can relate to, and can watch movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, where the main character looks like an older version of them. And most importantly, from a young age, they've read stories featuring illustrations and images of kids who share their features and their stories. They're able to see pictures in kids' books where other little black and brown children's lives reflect their own and are normalised and celebrated.  In short, they're not the only ones.  Ensuring my kids see their black imagery and experiences reflected in storybooks is a huge parenting priority. It's a very conscious part of my parenting to ensure their features, their complexion, their family makeup is reflected in storybooks. I want them to have a proximity and access to stories that are their stories. I've often wondered how many white parents prioritise this in building their kids' book selections?  Children of colour need diverse stories — if only to see themselves. Here's a list of some absolute favourites from my boys' library.   This book, beautifully written and illustrated by Kaytja Aboriginal artist Reggie Sultan, was gifted to my kids by a Pacific Islander community Aunty, artist and songwoman, Seini Taumoepeau. As she explains to the boys, this book tells the story of Pleiades constellation.  In Tonga, this story is known as Mataliki, and in Maori culture it is Matariki. My boys are total stargazers and love hearing stories of Pacific Island navigators so this is a book that appeals to them on so many levels.    Having beautiful hair is a curse and a blessing for my kids, my youngest in particular. With a huge golden afro, he is often subjected to unwanted touches from curious strangers and those familiar to him. Especially adults.  Being that he's very young, it takes a lot of courage to respond in the moment confidently, and we struggled for a long time to equip him with the right approach to speak up in these situations if we weren't around. But then, this book was gifted to us by a lovely neighbour who saw our struggle. And it's honestly the gift that keeps on giving, because I've been able to share it with other parents facing the same situation.  Don't Touch My Hair has been profound in equipping my little ones with the clear language to set boundaries around touching their hair. It also validates their uneasiness with others getting into their personal space, or ""space bubble"" as they call it. This has been an especially tricky situation for my younger boy who not only has people wanting to touch his hair but also secretly taking photos of him/his hair.  Don't do this, and don't be creepy.  The book features gorgeous illustrations and is a fun way to get the whole family to chant the main line together.   As my kids have been teased for their appearance — especially their hair — I actively went and sought books that spoke specifically to the aesthetics and beauty of black hair. This book is a winner.  The main character, MacKenzie, is teased by her classmates about her unruly Afro hair and runs to her neighbour's house for guidance on how to make her hair more palatable and manageable, so she won't be the butt of jokes anymore. The neighbour, Miss Tillie, uses her beautiful lush back garden as a metaphor for MacKenzie's hair, saying that ""like every good garden, it must be cared for every day."" It needs love and patience. This book is a powerful reminder of the beauty of black hair. There are tips in the back pages for black hair maintenance and recipes for a rinse and moisturising shea butter, which is fantastic and easy to make and apply.   When I wanted to get my eldest used to stepping into a barber shop and not feeling afraid of having his hair cut and styled, this was the book I read to him over and over. It made a huge difference with getting him excited about sitting in the barber's chair.  The illustrations by Gordon C James are absolutely striking and feature so many beautiful representations of melanated people. It's a lovely ode to instilling a healthy dose of self-confidence in little black boys the world over and connects them to a cultural space — the barbershop — that is significant within the afro-textured community.  It celebrates that magic of looking and feeling fantastically fresh and styled after the barber has worked his magic on your crowning glory. Extra love for the Crown reference in the book, which is a clear nod to the legacy of Basquiat.   Illustrated by children's book artist Fatima Anaya, this delightful story is by West Coast Eagles ruckman Nic Naitanui, about his first day of school. The book tracks little Nic's nervousness with starting school, but thanks to his Mum, and a bunch of new friends, it ends up being a great day.  Ideas of diversity can sometimes appear tokenistic, but this book celebrates and acknowledges diversity and difference in a meaningful and engaging way. I especially love that we get to learn snippets of the Fijian language in the book too (Naitanui is of Fijian heritage). The clincher for my boys is seeing another Pacific Islander boy hanging out with a bunch of mates not dissimilar to their own friendship circle.  This one's a must read for all school kids who are about to start school — or do a fresh start at a new school — anywhere across Australia.   It's said you shouldn't judge a book by its cover but I totally did — and thank goodness for that. This is a book that is beautifully illustrated, and features intersectional representations of childhood. The takeaway message encourages young readers to practice kindness to themselves and each other.  This is actually the loveliest aspect of this book — that it's basically a gorgeous ode to kindness, support and empathy. The main character makes positive affirmations about herself by comparing her journey to her natural surroundings, including lines like: ""Like the sun, I'm here to shine."" See? Adorable.   This excellent series shares the life stories of influential game-changers throughout history, from scientists, to creatives, activists, sporting heroes and more. They're right up there as some of my kids' absolute favourites when it comes to storytime.  Reading this series is an excellent resource for introducing important and influential people into my kids' lives. The books always features delightful illustrations to accompany text, plus each story features a timeline of the person's life in the back, which my children love reading as much as the story itself.  Each and every book has encouraged them to hop on the internet and look up more about the public figure to further learn more about their lives.  For reasons they can't quite articulate, Maya Angelou and Frida Kahlo are the absolute favourites of this series for my boys. Every single birthday party my boys go to, their buddies get one of these books gifted as part of their present loot.   I was beyond excited when I saw that the incredibly talented Eritrean author and poet Alia Gabres was releasing a children's book. As one of the most incredible arts practitioners who was living in Narrm/Melbourne, Gabres — now based in the US — had a huge impact on shifting the creative and public talks landscape in her former city.  Highlighting the moving and gentle affection between so many Elders and young children across the global black community, this book is an absolute must for my kids' library collection.  The relationship between my kids and their various Elders — their Nannas, their Papu (PNG Tolai word for Grandfather) and Bubu Meris (PNG for Grandmother) is gorgeously reflected in this book, when the main character hangs out with her Grandmother — her Haboba — for the day.  Again, the illustrations capture an aesthetic that is so uniquely stunning and moving, and the story is adorable. This book alone is a great addition to any kids' library.   The books I've listed are merely a small selection of my kids' library. They continue to be a big part of their lives, and my partner and I go out of our way to invest in beautiful books that reflect the diversity of our family and other families.  I see that when my kids are exposed to broader stories and narratives through books, when their lives are reflected and normalised between the pages of fun, funny, entertaining and thoughtful books, what that does to their sense of self and feelings of belonging is profound. I love that the range of stories in their library has planted the seed and opened up their minds to different ways of being in this lifetime. We've had really wonderful and nuanced conversations on diversity; conversations sparked by what they've read in books.  These books also send a powerful message to anyone who is welcomed into our home about what we as a family value and treasure.  That's one of the best gifts I'm able to extend to my children: giving them beautiful stories that are their passports into a range of places and spaces — to navigate familiar and unfamiliar territory.  Their lives are filled with narratives that gently nurture their empathy, nudge their curiosity and encourage a level of understanding for others.  Raising boys, I think a lot about masculinity and how to reframe the accepted societal expectations of what it apparently is to ""be a man"". Through books, my boys get to see men and boys who have similar features and experiences who practice forgiveness, kindness, empathy and gentleness towards others, and themselves. All traits that my partner and I heartily encourage in our boys. Our unique collection of storybooks help my boys feel less alone. The books validate their experiences and encourage them to not only be open to new stories and characters, but also new friends.  I love their fearlessness with accepting others as they stumble through a world that is constantly going through huge social and cultural change — particularly when it comes to identity. Their generation is so much more open-minded when it comes to respecting other ways of being. Difference is not seen as a deficit.",ABC Arts      By Namila Benson for The Book Show.,"March 28, 2020"

55,/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-streaming-entertainment-film-tv-indecision-paralysis/12085898,Entertainment during coronavirus: How do you overcome 'decision paralysis' when deciding what to watch?,"The cinemas are closed, the video stores are long gone, and everyone has to stay home: welcome to the golden age of streaming and downloading movies.   It is an unprecedented moment in time, in which the internet has cornered the movie market and just about every film you can think of is available online to either stream, purchase or rent digitally. As of December 2019 IMDb (Internet Movie Database), an online database of information on films, television shows, games and online content, listed 538,353 different movies in its archives. If your brain freezes up at the thought of having to pick one movie out of 10 to watch, let alone 538,353, you are not alone. Psychologists have plenty of names for this overwhelming sensation caused by having too many choices: decision paralysis, overchoice and analysis paralysis. So how do you get past the paralysis and pick just one film out of every movie ever made?   In 1997, a research lab in the University of Minnesota's computer science and engineering department created a website that lets you pick the movies you like, and then recommended films based on your preferences. Called Movielens, as of 2017 the site had accumulated 26 million ratings of more than 70,000 movies by more than 250,000 users. While streaming sites such as Netflix use their own algorithms to recommend things for you to watch based on what you've seen, Movielens does this in a more specialised way, improving its recommendations based on the more films you rate and the more people that use the site.     All you have to do is log on and unleash your inner critic, then sit back and let Movielens pick the perfect movie for you. If you, like many others, are signed up to more than one of the dozens of streaming platforms out there, it can be hard to keep track of what films you have access to across the various services.   That problem can be solved by sites such as JustWatch, a website and app with functions to help locate what to watch. It allows you to search for a film and then tells you what platform you can stream it on, or where you can rent or purchase a digital copy. It also tells you what films and shows are new to each platform, in case you feel like you have already seen them all. JustWatch also lets you select the streaming platforms you have access to and then shows you all the films and TV shows you can watch across all of them, while also letting you sort them by genre, Rotten Tomatoes score, age rating and more.   During current tough times, spending money on streaming or renting movies is a luxury some cannot afford — that is where free streaming platforms can help.   You might be familiar with streaming services for Australia's free-to-air channels, such ABC iview, SBS OnDemand, or 7plus, but have you heard of Kanopy, or the Internet Archive, or Plex or Tubi TV? These are all free streaming services.  Some of them are full of ads, but if you are used to watching free-to-air commercial TV that should be nothing new for you. Kanopy is a bit different — it is an Australian platform that has partnered with libraries and universities, so it is ad-free. All you need is a library card to access. The Internet Archive is home to films that are in the public domain, so if you are looking for Charlie Chaplin films, FW Murnau's Nosferatu, or even Night Of The Living Dead, this is the place to go.   Also keep in mind that some streaming services offer free trials, so you can get in, watch what you want, and get out before you have to pay … so long as you don't get overcome by decision paralysis. If you have plenty of time on your hands and are keen to broaden your cinematic horizons, you could seek suggestions by working your way through a top films list. There are hundreds out there to choose from, each purporting to detail the best of the best. For American or British classics, check out the American Film Institute's various lists of the top 100 films of all time, which also includes genre-specific lists, or the British Film Institute's top 100. The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die is updated regularly, IMDb has a list of the top 250 films as voted by the site's users and movie magazines like Empire and Premiere publish ""best of"" lists all the time.

56,/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-social-distancing-friends-online-animal-crossing/12080982,"Coronavirus is forcing friends apart, but games like Animal Crossing and D&D are bringing them back together","The friends gather close together on the beach and start exchanging fruit. It's the kind of close contact authorities in real life are pleading with people to stop. Pears, apples, oranges and coconuts are swapped. Elyce brought peaches. Peaches from Peachbutt Island. Elyce Phillips is in charge of Peachbutt Island.  The island's her little corner of the new game Animal Crossing: New Horizons — which Elyce sums up as a ""nice town simulator"". ""You get a little deserted island, you set it up with little houses, you get to decorate it how you like and then just chill out,"" she says. ""It's hard to do when you're busy with life. This dropped at just the right time."" The comedian has had a little more time on her hands lately — coronavirus has meant weeks of cancelled gigs, and physical distancing has made meeting up with friends impossible.   But in the game being social is encouraged. Loved ones are just a short flight (in a plane piloted by a dodo) away. ""I can go visit my girlfriend's island when at the moment I can't actually go, because she's in Tasmania and they're locked off. So it's a handy little substitute for doing visits to people that I can't actually go and see in person at the moment,"" Elyce says. The visit can't make up for the real thing, but the connection means a lot when isolated from friends.   ""Yesterday, a bunch of my friends from Twitter arranged to meet on one person's island at a certain time to swap some fruit. It was very wholesome. A nice little get-together with five or six of us,"" Elyce says. She says whether it's meeting up online, or with messages and calls offline, she's noticed people making an effort to connect. ""I think all of my social circles have been making a really nice, conscious effort to make sure that everyone's still feeling included and everyone's got everything they need,"" she says. ""It's been really nice to see my community come together and really look out for everyone. ""The news is so anxiety-inducing. This is an activity that my brain can handle right now."" For nearly a year Grace Shalders and a group of friends have been getting together every couple of weeks, cooking a meal and settling down to a game of Dungeons & Dragons. Players navigate the characters they've created through adventures in a world created and described by the person running the game — the Dungeon Master (DM).   Grace says it's really about connecting with mates. ""It's a really social, fun way of hanging out with my mates. It's also really fun to play and act as a character, and we all get so many laughs out of it,"" she says. ""Mostly I really love playing with these friends."" Together they've laughed their way through adventures like defeating a vine monster that had taken over a lighthouse and running a co-op business. But coronavirus proved a real-world threat to the fun. One of the group is immunocompromised so — not prepared to split the party — they adapted. The mates who had navigated jungles and survived worlds where they weren't able to use their magic, navigated social distancing by taking their game online, with everyone connecting through a video conferencing site.   In the real world their DM left players dice and a map of their fantasy realm to pick up outside his house. They left snacks so they could remotely share them. In their online world they fought some crocodiles. ""I feel really lucky to have mates who are taking this seriously and all looking after each other and our health by staying separate. And also really lucky to have friends who will still put that time into connecting with each other, even if we can't do it in the usual way,"" Grace says,   There was a silver lining: a former member of the group who had moved to Japan was able to join in again. Together they defeated the crocodiles, allowing them to continue on their virtual journey. The rewards in the real world are as just as important.   ""Having the chance to chat and not look at the news for a few hours is almost a sense of normalcy. It was a really positive to thing to still have in the midst of all this upheaval,"" Grace says. ""Having to find a new way to still connect in the ways we're used to but from afar has been so important just for my mental health and general sanity.  ""Being able to play this regular game that I really enjoy with my friends is actually really important."" Professor Daniel Johnson, who studies psychology and video games at Queensland University of Technology, is also getting creative while adjusting to social distancing. ""I was trying to work out with my neighbours, could we play cards while maintaining the appropriate amount of distance between ourselves from the corners of their back deck?"" he says.   He's not surprised people are finding value in connecting through online games — the research of his team, and of others around the world has shown that for a decade. ""There's a great deal of research to show not only that games provide that connection, but they do actually generate what we call social capital, which is directly linked to wellbeing,"" he explains. He says with what's going in the world, that wellbeing is important. ""Right now it's more important than ever that we connect with one another,"" Professor Johnson says. ""There's two things going on, we're in a very stressful situation, there's a great deal of unknown, and our normal way of looking after ourselves, of connecting with people, has to change. ""I guess the good news is that it's really clear that video games are an excellent way to do this."" He says titles that support multiplayer, like Animal Crossing and a new Call of Duty game, are very popular right now. ""I think everything that's coming out at the moment that supports multiplayer is seeing a real boost,"" he says. Last weekend game distribution service Steam set a new record for concurrent players with more than 22 million users online. Professor Johnson says he's had more friends than ever asking him what they could play while sharing a coffee or beer over a video call. ""So there's some games like trivia games, board games that you can play digitally that are going to see a resurgence and I think we'll increasingly see people coming up with really clever ideas."" That includes finding spaces online to connect, whether it be fighting vine monsters and crocodiles, or just sitting on a beach on Peachbutt Island, watching the sun set over the sea.

57,/news/2020-03-27/judith-lucy-podcast-overwhelmed-dying-comedy/12080958,Judith Lucy's new ABC podcast is fitting listening for our 'Overwhelmed and Dying' times,"In the first episode of Judith Lucy's new podcast, she recounts the moment she found out her long-term partner had been stealing from her. ""I was sitting in my hotel room on the phone to him when he said the words; 'I can't keep gaslighting you, I've been stealing money out of your bank accounts for over two years'."" Lucy was in the middle of a 2017 national stand-up comedy tour with fellow comedy veteran and collaborator Denise Scott. ""And the name of the tour we were doing — Disappointments — might alert you to the fact that I'd already had a few,"" Lucy says in her podcast: Judith Lucy - Overwhelmed & Dying.  In the eight half-hour-long episodes of Overwhelmed & Dying, Lucy examines ageing, wellness, sex, intimacy, death, grief, meaning and climate change. ""There's a lot about connecting, there's a lot about the natural world, there's a lot about dealing with your anxiety by taking action,"" the comedian told RN's Stop Everything!.   Right before she turned 50, Lucy says, she woke up and realised ""the world is screwed and so is my life. How am I going to make the most of my remaining years on this planet?"" ""And, by the way, that sounds like a podcast for the ABC — why not go back to my old and only trick of exploiting my misery for cash? ""Well, not much cash, because it's the ABC.""  Lucy would have preferred to not mention what had transpired with her ex-partner (who she describes as ""actually a good person"") in the podcast. ""But I didn't feel that I could actually be honest in terms of where the podcast came from and why I was doing it — if I didn't share that part of the story,"" she says. ""And that was kind of the endpoint of a terrible time, because my life really started to turn into a crap sandwich a few years before that, when my brother died of cancer - and he was the last living member of my family.""    This loss was followed by ""overnight"" menopause and disillusionment with her nearly three-decade-long comedy career. ""It was all wrapped up in a delightful midlife crisis bow. And unfortunately, the one thing I did feel good about was my partner — and then that went to crap. And so that's when I realised I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning,"" she recalls. The world outside her bed wasn't helping, either. ""If I ever made the mistake of listening to the ABC and [hearing] what was going on in the world that just confirmed that I wanted to grab a bottle of vodka and just weep and sleep."" But instead of weeping and sleeping, Lucy, who has in the past worked as a broadcaster for both the ABC and commercial radio stations, approached the ABC about making a podcast. ""Probably the reason I did a podcast is that nobody will watch a 52-year-old woman on television,"" Lucy says, despite the 2019 petition to make her the next Bachelorette. And while we won't have the pleasure of seeing a bevvy of men vying for Lucy's love on network television, Lucy does look at sex and dating in the series. ""I say 'lube' three times in the first episode, and I'm proud of it,"" says the comedian. In an early episode of the podcast (Hanging Up My Vagina), Lucy attends a tantric tango class, speaks to a sexologist and has a portrait of her vulva done by the artist Greg Taylor.   An upcoming episode is about how we can respond to climate change. ""Essentially I do go on a date with a tree. And I can really recommend it — I went on a 'nature experience', and you're sort of just present with a tree ... I was standing near this tree and I actually had to ask it if I could touch it,"" Lucy explains. Deb Punton, an ecopsychologist at the Port Phillip EcoCentre, created this ""nature experience"" in response to her despair over climate change. ""She [Punton] wanted to start finding a way to connect with nature that was actually positive and that might encourage people to become more involved with the natural world,"" says Lucy. Triggered by her own climate-induced panic, Lucy's tree date was just one step in a ""slow dawning realisation about the power of the natural world"". Other steps included reading The Overstory by Richard Powers, listening to the Emergence Magazine Podcast, and volunteering at the EcoCentre where she met Punton. ""I was at this point in my journey where it did feel quite reasonable to go on a date with a tree and I got quite emotional,"" Lucy recalls. ""Deb [Punton] and I were emailing about something the other day and she said she hoped I had caught up with my special tree, and I like to think it's an ongoing relationship."" Alongside volunteering at the EcoCentre, Lucy recently met with her local MP to discuss climate change and says that ""getting more involved has absolutely helped my state of mind"". ""The whole idea of the podcast is that people will go away and do something.""   The series culminates in Lucy snorkelling at Western Australia's Ningaloo Reef with the novelist Tim Winton. ""I learnt many things because I did many things,"" Lucy says of making the podcast. ""Frankly, now I'm enlightened and not overwhelmed anymore — though I'm still dying. While Lucy was meant to be performing her latest stand up show Judith Lucy Vs Men at this year's Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the festival has now been cancelled as a result of COVID-19. Although she recorded the podcast before the outbreak of the pandemic, it is impossible to ignore just how timely the subject matter is. Lucy says the audience for her podcast is ""everybody, [because] we're all overwhelmed and dying.""

58,/news/2020-03-27/coronavirus-cinemas-mostly-confident-they-can-withstand-crisis/12092766,Coronavirus shutdown will put pressure on cinemas forced to weather piracy and streaming storms,"Cinemas operators are broadly confident they can make it through the coronavirus shutdown, though some say relief from landlords will be required and some smaller, independent theatres may not survive. The ban on mass gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus has led to the closure of all cinemas nationwide. Benjamin Zeccola, chief executive of Palace Cinemas, which has 17 sites across the country, said the company would soon need to borrow from the bank, leaving it saddled with an unhealthy amount of debt once it began trading again.   It is also not eligible for the Federal Government's business support payments, Mr Zeccola said, because it had a turnover above $50 million. ""I just don't see the need for there to be a cap,"" he said of the grant scheme. ""All businesses are struggling."" He said turnover of that amount did not represent liquidity, and that cinemas, which have high staffing and infrastructure costs, operated on ""wafer-thin"" margins.   ""The other area that is the most frightening thing for many businesses right now is landlords,"" he said. ""We are on pause. Everything is frozen. There are no customers. There is no income. There can be no rent for months. And I don't think that's sinking in. I think the Government has to step in to support employers."" Hoyts, one of the larger chains, could not make anyone available for an interview, but in a statement said it was too soon to know for certain what the impact on the industry would be. Kristian Connelly, who runs Cinema Nova in Carlton in central Melbourne, said while there was uncertainty for the business and its 50 casual and permanent staff, the cinema was well-placed to survive the shutdown, largely because they were coming off a strong summer period. However, he said: ""I suspect that there will be a degree of rationalisation across the entire industry where we will see some closures."" ""The smaller independents seem to be likely to be under greater pressure than some of the larger players.""   Mr Zeccola agreed some cinemas would inevitably not survive. Independents make up 31 per cent of all cinemas, the largest share, according to Screen Australia data, and account for most of the regional venues. ""Whilst Australians are still able to access their local shows on TV, streaming and online, the exhibition and distribution market is suffering badly right now,"" Screen Australia chief executive Graeme Mason said. ""So, when cinemas open again, and they will, we will need to vote with our wallets and go support our exhibitors and filmmakers.""   Scott Seddon, president of Independent Cinemas Australia and the owner of two venues in the Hunter region in NSW, said he hoped no independent cinemas would close for good, but that it depended on measures like rent relief, Government assistance and forbearance from the banks. ""Many independent cinemas were badly affected by the bushfires because their towns were closed,"" he said, meaning it had already been a tough start to 2020. Cinemas would also need to make sure they could regularly fire up their projectors throughout the shutdown, he said, because older units particularly can degrade if they go several months without being turned on, potentially leading to a replacement bill in the tens of thousands of dollars. It has already been a difficult decade for cinemas. As the pressure from piracy waned, the arrival of Netflix, Disney+ and other streaming services made for a crowded screen entertainment market. Box office sales were slightly down in 2019, according to a Screen Australia report. Last year, before coronavirus emerged, some analysts were predicting minor growth in cinemas in the coming five years, while others saw a decline, with rising ticket prices failing to make up for a lack of innovation that would increase competitiveness. Now, with film and television production having ceased around the world, some studios have started sending films that would otherwise have gone to cinemas straight to streaming services.   The Invisible Man, which has been topping box offices around the world but had its theatre run cut short, is already streaming, as is Emma, the Jane Austen story brought to screen. Trolls World Tour will go straight to streaming, while Frozen 2 will have its release date pulled forward by three months and sent straight to Disney+. But Australian cinema owners the ABC spoke to don't fear that will become more common after the shutdown ends — that a long-standing norm about the primacy of the theatre experience will be shattered. Already, major blockbusters like No Time To Die, the new James Bond film, have been delayed rather than rushed to streaming services. And after a period of confinement, cinema operators say, the public will be itching to get out and experience storytelling on the biggest screen.  Mr Connelly said: ""I think people are going to be reminded about how emotionally important cinema is to not just to entertain but to connect.""

59,/news/2020-03-26/coronavirus-delays-sports-esports-can-fill-the-void/12085318,Coronavirus has stalled traditional sports around the world. Esports are here to fill the weekend void,"Every major sporting league in Australia is on hiatus. Normally spoiled for choice in the winter months, sports fans have been left with empty weekends indefinitely.  Except they haven't. As traditional sports grappled with, then lost, the battle to try to operate in a world of social distancing and shutdown orders, the world of esports moved out of stadiums and back to its online roots, ready to fill the void. We've enlisted Byteside editor Seamus Byrne to help guide you through the weekend. It's pretty simple: it's video games played competitively. Just like traditional sports, there are many different kinds of games to play or watch. Some are virtual representations of real-world sports (like FIFA or iRacing), others are wild fantasy worlds that bear little to no resemblance to real life (like League of Legends or Starcraft II). ""Esports is not a single thing. There's a million different things and so if you try one and it doesn't catch your eye, it doesn't mean that all these esports aren't going to be for you,"" Byrne said. Many operate under structured professional leagues just like the AFL or NRL, and there are often millions of dollars of prize money on the line. The only difference is most of them can be played online.   Just like it can be tricky for a non-sports fan to understand what is happening if a bowler takes a hat-trick or sends four wides down leg side, it's tricky for non-esports fans to understand what's happening if Profit is popping off on Tracer in a 1v5 to secure second point on Volsakya. Byrne says the best thing to do is just start watching. ""Don't panic that you don't understand what's going on, first listen to the commentators and sort of slowly start to try to pick up the rhythm of the game,"" he said. Think of it like explaining cricket to a visitor from overseas, Byrne says. It's going to take a little while to appreciate what's happening, and that's OK. So, what should you watch?  Motorsport fans are best positioned here. Formula 1 has launched a Virtual Grand Prix Series to replace the races that have been postponed due to the coronavirus. Current F1 drivers will play the F1 2019 PC game on the same tracks as the cancelled races. The events will run on the same weekends the real-life Grand Prix were due, and they'll be broadcast on the official Formula 1 Twitch and YouTube channels. NASCAR is also taking a similar move, and has launched a multi-week series that will be played in iRacing. It began this week, and you can keep up to date on future events on the official NASCAR channels. Denny Hamlin, who won the race, even got some unusual help during the race.   ""The real drivers, because they train in these simulators anyway, it's not like for them it's some foreign experience for them,"" Byrne said. ""There's no question that when they're behind the wheel, they're completely going for it."" Unfortunately for football fans, the FIFA 20 Global Series has been suspended until further notice because many events were played in-person. For updates on the series, you can check in on the official channels. Look no further than Rocket League. It's like football, but the players are cars. Rocket League is simple to pick-up but much more in-depth than it appears. If you've ever watched a game of football, you'll be comfortable watching a game of Rocket League. Players score goals. The most goals wins.   An added bonus is that Rocket League is rated G. No guns or violence to be found, so it's a good one for the family to watch. And despite coronavirus interrupting some live events, Rocket League's North American, European, Oceanic and South American Championship Series are continuing online. The next game kicks off at 9:00am AEDT on Sunday, and you can watch all the action on Rocket League's Twitch channel, or here's the full schedule. There's a good chance you've played Call of Duty at some point in the shooter series' decade-long run as one of the most popular games on the planet. If you have, you'll be pretty well prepared to dive into the Call of Duty League. The competition is on hiatus at the moment as it switches to online competition only, but it's due to start back up soon. Head over to their official website for more on the schedule. When it does resume, you can catch all the action on the Call of Duty League YouTube channel. The Overwatch League will also be easier to grasp if you've dabbled in games before.   Overwatch is a first-person shooter where teams of six players choose unique heroes, then compete over an objective. A blend of individual skill and near-perfect co-ordination with teammates is vital to success. Modelled on a traditional sports league, the Overwatch League features city-based teams from around the world competing in a single competition. The league returns this weekend with a whopping 16 matches, starting on Saturday evening at 7:00pm AEDT. You can catch every game on the Overwatch League YouTube channel. This is jumping in the deep end. You might not understand what's going on, but rest assured you're watching the best of the best when it comes to esports. ""Come to it with that same openness that you'd try to ask of someone else when you're trying to introduce them to your favourites,"" Byrne said. First up the world's biggest esport — League of Legends.   It's known as a multi-player online battle arena game, where two teams of five players go head-to-head. Each player chooses a champion with unique abilities from a huge list of 148, then they battle it out to try to destroy the opposing team's base on the other side of the map. The gameplay goes much, much deeper than that and takes years to master, but that's part of the appeal that draws many players to the game. Much like real-life football, there are localised competitions around the world. In this case, leagues run in places like Korea, China, North America, Europe and Oceania. There is a whole suite of games happening this week, and you can watch games over on the Riot Games Twitch or YouTube channel. See a full rundown of who's playing and when. Second, one of the world's oldest esports —  Counter-Strike.   With a competitive history dating back nearly 20 years, few esports have endured as long as Counter-Strike. Competition is now played in the game's sequel, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It's a first-person shooter where rounds are fast, the action is tense and only those with the fastest of reflexes and sharpest aim can survive. There are several leagues around the world that you can tune into. You can see a full list of them and where to watch right here. Byrne recommends tuning into the Oceanic Pro League (OPL) this Friday and Saturday night. It's the top league for League of Legends here in Australia. ""It's got Aussie commentators who can hold your hand a little bit on that path into it,"" Byrne said. See the OPL schedule. That's OK. There are plenty of esports fish in the sea. Byrne says the best place to find something to your own tastes is at the newly launched esports website Juked. ""They have this lovely portal that just shows you that sports wall of everything major that's happening right now in esports. It is just kind of so handy as a place to just jump in and have a quick scroll through what's happening,"" he said.",By Peter Marsh,"March 26, 2020"
60,/news/2020-03-26/coronavirus-cant-stop-the-music-as-online-lessons-in-demand/12089060,Coronavirus sees ARIA-winning musicians turn online teachers as students flock to lessons,"Music festivals are cancelled, tour buses parked, and live music venues shut, but some of Australia's top entertainers and producers have been using their spare time to keep the music going online.   As a result, aspiring artists have access to a number of famous musicians, singers, and songwriters in a way that would not have been possible before the COVID-19 crisis.  ""Singing teaching for me has always been a ying-and-yang thing with touring schedules. And when all the COVID-19 stuff hit home I moved all my students to the online platform,"" nine-times Golden Guitar winner and singing teacher Lyn Bowtell said.   ""I'm not touring, not doing shows. But I love interaction.  ""Fellow artists like Catherine Britt, Anthony Taylor, Melody Moko, and so many more are offering tutorials online — songwriting, mentoring, and now you can potentially learn guitar or write a song with one of your favourite singer-songwriters.""  She said a number of her existing students who were full-time musicians could not afford sessions anymore, but there was a real opportunity for aspiring singers.  Drummer Josh Schuberth is a music producer, audio engineer, and multi-instrumentalist who has worked with names like Ben Folds, Josh Pyke, and Alex Lloyd.  With 20 years of industry knowledge and a resume that includes ARIA awards and gold and platinum records, he is all set to dabble in drum lessons over Skype. ""Creative minds will come up with creative solutions and the internet is a way we can connect,"" he said. ""You can have a video chat, the audio quality is more than good enough, and you can even hear what someone is playing on an instrument.   ""It's not too different to a face-to-face lesson."" Studio sessions and live gigs would normally consume his time, but he said all that had changed since the coronavirus crisis hit. ""I'm passionate about the teaching side of things and it feels like this is an opportunity to reassess and take on different challenges and share my experience. It is exciting,"" Schuberth said. ""You can teach guitar, drums, or vocals. The technology is there and it's a really great way to pass knowledge on without having to be in the same room.""  Turning to a keyboard in her home office while being interviewed over a video chat, Lyn Bowtell said she was keen to brush up on her skills in between teaching others.  ""To learn an instrument is a joy in itself and it's one of the only activities that uses the analytical and creative mind at the same time,"" she said.  ""I've started an online course to improve my own piano skills and I also want to improve my guitar skills during these down times.  ""I was only complaining the other day I don't get enough time to write new songs.""      Producers like Schuberth said he also believed there could be a surge in creative recordings from home studios.  ""It'll take more than COVID-19 to stop people from creating,"" he said.  ""There might be more artists sitting at home looking to make a record with whatever gear they have at their disposal.  ""They might not be able to record drums, so people like myself could record bits remotely and piece recordings together from all different parts of the country.""    As Greg Baxter rummages through a box of gadgets like siren whistles and random percussion at his music store in Bundaberg. He said business had slowed, but there was renewed interest and opportunity as customers prepared to make music at home. ""[You're] never too old to learn an instrument. It's the best thing you can do in times like this to keep you heading down the right track,"" he said.    Guitars, keyboard, and drums top the list of instruments to learn according to Mr Baxter. But his colleague Gav Hunter said he still preferred the banjo. ""It's the banjo that'll get us through these hard times,"" he joked. ""There have been people buying strings and repairing instruments. Anytime is a good time to lean an instrument.""     ",ABC Wide Bay      By Scott Lamond,"March 26, 2020"
61,/news/2020-03-25/weddings-postponed-across-australia-due-to-coronavirus/12088544,Coronavirus has put wedding plans on hold — but some couples are racing to beat the restrictions,"Love conquers all — and it seems that remains equally, if not more, true during a time of coronavirus crisis.   With more than 2,000 cases of the disease confirmed across the nation, the Federal Government has put strict measures into place to control the spread.  Among them is a limit on wedding sizes — no more than five people will be able to attend for the foreseeable future.  The restrictions come into force at midnight, and were only announced last night, but have still given some couples enough time to bring their big days forward — to Wednesday. Groom Lachlan Hennekam, from Yorketown on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula, moved his wedding to Wednesday afternoon, just in time to beat the deadline.  ""We were meant to get married on Saturday, but obviously, with the new rules coming into effect midnight tonight we've moved it forward to today,"" he said. Mr Hennekam and bride-to-be Kristen Kossatz put the word out to their family and friends on Facebook.  ""We put a post up saying that it's on today if anyone's around and wants to attend they're more than welcome,"" he said. ""The most important thing for us is that our parents could be here. So my mum, and mother- and father-in-law, are coming but unfortunately my dad lives in northern New South Wales so he couldn't make it.""   Mr Hennekam supported the Government's measures, but said he did not want to wait.    ""I completely understand where Scott Morrison is coming from on this,"" he said. ""We've been trying to organise this for a while now and we got so close it's not worth postponing it now, because if we postpone it now it may not happen."" The new restrictions come after 35 coronavirus cases were linked to a wedding in New South Wales earlier this month.  Mr Hennekam said he was doing everything he could to make guests safe.  ""We'll be implementing social distancing — all our chairs today will be one-and-a-half metres apart. We're going to have hand sanitisers, soaps and all sorts of things for people to use."" The wedding industry generates more than $2 billion a year in Australia, and it is not just couples who will be affected.  Penelope Carrick has been a celebrant for eight years, and coronavirus restrictions mean her business has already taken a huge hit.  ""Almost all my couples have postponed to either spring this year or 2021,"" she said. ""Everyone is of course devastated.""   One of her couples, Lauren Gray and Josh Matheson, has also been racing against the clock, bringing their nuptials forward to Wednesday afternoon. ""I've basically had to plan a wedding in a day,"" Ms Gray said.  She said she felt they could not cancel, because of the significant financial investment in their big day, but it was the right choice for them.  ""We sunk about $30,000 into this wedding,"" she said. ""For us, if we're going to go into self-isolation we just wanted to call each other husband and wife while we did it."" Sixteen of Ms Carrick's clients have postponed their dates so far, but she was confident her business would recover. ""I'll get through this and it will bounce back,"" she said. ""I'm not going to stop doing what I do, I love it too much. I've just had to press pause.""   Adelaide couple Billie Trewin and Dave Crook have decided to keep their May 10 date as planned and will have some close friends as witnesses. They said it was a difficult decision, but they are planning to have a bigger celebration when the restrictions lift.  ""Our celebrant has offered us a mini-ceremony for just us, and then she'll do a bigger version of our wedding when we can,"" Ms Trewin said. ""It was pretty hard to begin with but I've kind of come to terms with it.""   The new restrictions will come into effect at midnight, stopping any more than five people from attending weddings — including the couple, the celebrant and their witnesses.  It is a devastating blow for couples who have spent considerable time, energy and money into planning their big day.   Katy Parrish and her partner Stuart Richardson were also supposed to get married this weekend but have made the difficult decision to postpone the wedding.  ""We have tried many avenues, going from sit-down to cocktail outside, cutting the list, moving it to our farm in Tumby Bay,"" Ms Parrish said. ""We're really frustrated [but] unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about it.  ""Obviously being with a farmer, everything is planned out as our life is around the farm. This whole virus puts our whole life another year behind. ""[But] we will get married one day.""

62,"/news/2020-03-25/albert-uderzo,-a-creator-of-french-hero-asterix,-dies-at-92/12087638","Asterix The Gaul co-creator Albert Uderzo dies in Paris, aged 92","Albert Uderzo, one of the two creators of the beloved comic book character Asterix, who captured the spirit of the Gauls of yore and grew a reputation worldwide, has died. He was 92.   The French press quoted family members as saying Uderzo died of a heart attack in the Paris suburb of Neuilly. Asterix — portrayed as a short man with a droopy moustache always wearing a helmet with wings — was created in the early 1960s by Uderzo and Rene Goscinny.   The character lived in a village in Gaul, present-day France, resisting Roman conquerors with the help of his inseparable big-bellied friend, Obelix. ""Albert Uderzo died in his sleep at his Neuilly home of a heart attack with no links to the coronavirus,"" the French press quoted his son-in-law, Bernard de Choisy, as saying. ""He had been very tired for several weeks."" French Culture Minister Franck Riester said that Uderzo ""found the magic potion"", referring to his spirit, craftsmanship and long hours of work. Mr Riester may also have been making a reference to the famous magic potion in the Asterix series, which gave the hero and his fellow villagers temporary superhuman strength. ""Supreme nobility, he accepted that his heroes survive him for the happiness of the public,"" Mr Riester said.   Uderzo was the artist of all 33 Asterix adventures and story writer of the last nine books. The characters Uderzo drew were initially created with writer Rene Goscinny. Together, they created 24 comic books. After Goscinny's death in 1977, Uderzo also took over the writing duties, deciding to continue without his creative partner, finally retiring at age 84. Goscinny's daughter, Anne, called the two men ""brothers"" and praised Uderzo's ""courage"" for continuing without his collaborator.  ""They were as different as fire and water, but they lived something that few among us could live,"" she told the French daily Le Parisien. ""They were the kind of friends you don't often have in life.""   Uderzo, whose father was an Italian immigrant, was born on April 25, 1927, in France's Marne region, and grew up outside Paris. As a child, he was captivated by Walt Disney characters, notably Mickey Mouse — one of the inspirations for his own artistic talents. After numerous jobs and referrals, he met Goscinny when he was 24. An instant friendship developed ""and we decided to remake the world with all the thoughtlessness and the boldness of our youth,"" Le Monde quoted Uderzo as saying in his memoirs. After collaborating on other projects for some nine years, Asterix Le Gaulois appeared in 1961.  Fans offered thanks on social media and recollections of childhood memories reading the Asterix comic books.         The Asterix books have been translated into dozens of languages. Asterix-based spinoffs include movies and a theme park outside Paris that draws tens of thousands of visitors each year. ABC/wires",,"March 25, 2020"
63,/news/2020-03-24/coronavirus-might-see-us-embrace-reruns/11909274,Coronavirus might see us savour the pleasures of reruns and comfort TV,"To paraphrase the Prime Minister: how good are re-runs? Monica and Chandler hooking up in London, again.  The Soup Nazi, again.  That familiar ""dun-dun"" at the start of Law & Order.  Buffy! Coach Taylor! Nine-Nine!  With much of the entertainment industry, from cinemas to bars to music venues, shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, you're probably going to be spending a lot more time on the couch.   And now, with the constant low hum of fear and uncertainty — and given audiences are already nostalgia-hungry — it's likely that watch time will include the shows you already know and love. Will that make this the golden age of the re-watch? Nostalgia for a time when we were younger, less stressed and more carefree is part of the appeal of re-watching shows, says the University of Melbourne's Lauren Rosewarne, author of the new book Why We Remake. She believes consumption will increase. ""I've personally found myself putting The Gilmore Girls on in the background for example, when I'd normally work with CNN on,"" she said.   Even before the pandemic, Netflix, Stan, Amazon, Disney and others were filling their libraries with the complete catalogues of old TV shows. Netflix has every season of Offspring and The Big Bang Theory. Stan has every episode of Breaking Bad and the 1990s supernatural drama Charmed. It's a cost-effective way for the services to supplement the new, original series they are pumping their production budgets into — or at least they were, before coronavirus effectively halted all film and television production. It is also particularly useful in the age of the reboot and the remake, when nostalgia drives box office success.   In 2018, Netflix paid a reported $US100 million ($168 million) for the rights to Friends in the US. That's more than the cost of producing the last season of Game of Thrones. Last year, Stan promoted an Australian tour by the couch from Friends — the couch! — which gives you some indication of how important it thought that 15-year-old show was to its audience. In January, former Friend David Schwimmer (aka Ross Geller) said he thought the series had endured because it captured friendship at a time before smartphones and social media. ""It was six people who actually sat and talked to each other,"" he told The Guardian, a comment that feels nostalgia-inducing during this time of social distancing. Jason Sternberg, a senior lecturer in the school of communication at the Queensland University of Technology, said he expected Australians to be turning to re-runs during this time, calling them an ""emotional blanket comforter"". ""We are gravitating towards sitcoms, and that makes perfect sense,"" he said, citing the fact The Office was the most popular streaming title on Netflix in the US in 2018, according to Nielsen data. ""They are short, the emphasis is on laughter. Something is wrong at the start, and within 25 minutes, it's resolved. ""If only the world could be like that at the moment.""   Research around the use of spoilers when discussing plotlines has shown that knowing the ending of a TV show or movie doesn't significantly impact your enjoyment of it. ""There's a lot of comfort in knowing when something's going to happen,"" Elizabeth Cohen, an associate professor who specialises in media psychology at West Virginia University, told The Atlantic recently. ""You don't have to exert a lot of cognitive energy, so it doesn't feel taxing."" Dr Sternberg said research had also shown that one of the appeals of horror movies among young people was that they provided a safe space in which to gain control of emotions like fear. That might explain the recent popularity of Contagion, the 2011 thriller about a deadly pandemic, which surged back up the iTunes charts last month.   A Netflix spokesperson would not say whether it was experiencing stronger demand for certain kinds of titles, but its Australian top-10 on Monday — a list of the most popular titles on that day, according to Netflix — listed the docuseries Pandemic at number eight. Dr Sternberg said audiences were good at separating factual viewing, like Pandemic, which might prove useful, from a fictional story like Contagion that simply provides gratification. ""It wouldn't surprise me at all that someone would watch Contagion and embrace the feel-good Hollywood blockbuster ending, and all those sorts of tropes, but at the same time go to a series like Pandemic or actual news.""   Another aspect that might factor into renewed interest in pandemic storylines right now is a theory of psychology called social comparison. It suggests that we seek out situations where other people are faring worse than us to make ourselves feel better. Essentially: we're glad it's Gwyneth Paltrow dying from a contagious pathogen, not us. Another important question: given the significance of this event, will we get a whole lot of pandemic-themed content in 18 months? Dr Rosewarne thinks so. ""Not only do we have a slew of screenwriters currently on lockdown with time on their hands and news headlines circulating around them, but Hollywood just has a track record of using these kind of world events as springboards,"" she said. Series like Homeland and 24 were directly inspired by a post-9/11 culture of fear around terrorism and the politicisation of immigration.   Before that, we had late-90s films like Outbreak, Armageddon, Independence Day and Deep Impact that drew on anxiety around the end of the world in the lead-up to the new millennium. Television critic Dan Barrett, who writes the newsletter Always Be Watching, said that rather than drawing from reality, a new crop of post-COVID-19 shows might try to distract viewers from it. ""I'm actually expecting to see an embrace of high-concept fantasy, broad comedies, and aspirational soap opera-style drama,"" he said.  ""Expect TV to feel more like Magnum PI and less like True Detective."" Critic Luke Buckmaster, who writes for The Guardian and Flicks.com.au, said there would certainly be an impact from this pandemic on the arts, but the more interesting question was what form that would take in terms of tone or the use of subtext or metaphor. ""The dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, for instance, hugely influenced Japan's anime stories and their apocalyptic undertones,"" he said.

Mr McGowan, who is about to turn 70, was among the last of the students to learn as part of the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind (RVIB) training program in the 1960s. He learnt the intricacies of setting a scale and recognising pitch and frequencies for which an acute sense of hearing is crucial. It is a skill that is better suited to the blind, according to Mr McGowan, and one he loves. ""To tune a piano properly is just lovely, it makes you feel good, and it makes people happy,"" Mr McGowan said. These days technology has replaced people, with many using computer programs attached to mobile phones to do the job But it is nowhere near as accurate as the ear according to Mr McGowan who laments the lost skill and said the only place in the world for blind people to train closed two years ago in the United States. ""I think it's really sad. Many blind people are unemployed and now living off the NDIS,"" Mr McGowan said. A 2018 study by Vision Australia found only 24 per cent of people who were blind or vision-impaired were in full-time employment. Vice-President of the Australasian Piano Tuners of Australia (APTTA) Michael Ryan said there were no training schools or apprenticeships available in Australia, with the trade removed from the register 10 years ago. ""We have been pushing for a long time for training to be reinstated,"" Mr Ryan said. Born in 1950, Mr McGowan's optic nerves were damaged when he was born three months premature.  ""In those days we were lucky to live, but they couldn't get rid of us,"" he said. From the age of two-and-a-half, the RVIB became young Mr McGowan's weekday home, then on weekends, he would return to the suburbs, often greeting Mondays in tears. ""But that's the way it was, you got used to it,"" Mr McGowan said.   The RVIB was the first institution of its type in Australia, opened in 1866 as the Victorian Asylum and School for the Blind before being renamed in 1891 as the RVIB. However, the era for specialised schools for the blind ended in 2009, when the RVIB made way for Vision Australia, part of a move toward a more integrated approach to education. ""Students who are blind or have low vision are best educated alongside their sighted peers, with access to educational resources and tools of their choosing,"" a spokesperson for Vision Australia said. But Mr McGowan does not agree. ""We grew up in the best time possible for blind people, the staff were good, the school was good, the system was as close to perfect as you'll ever get,"" he said.   Ever since Mr McGowan was 12 years old, he wanted to learn how to tune a piano. ""I remember when I was five, someone took the top off a piano and I fell inside and felt the bass strings of the bottom, and I kind of liked the feel of it,"" he laughed. His two-year course at the RVIB began in 1967, eventually leading to more than a decade of employment at Allans Music, a popular chain of music stores throughout Australia. The keen piano player has been working ever since. ""I've had a wonderful career out of this job,"" Mr McGowan said. His first concert job at the age of 22 was for the American band Chicago. The following year he met Diana Ross and Ian Anderson from the British Rock group Jethro Tull, whom he considered a ""really nice guy"". ""It's just another tuning job, you've got to make sure you do it properly,"" Mr McGowan said.  These days he works for three different stores in Melbourne, which includes home visits.  ""I'll be tuning as long as I can,"" he said. ",ABC Central Victoria      By                                 Larissa Romensky,"March 24, 2020"
65,/news/2020-03-24/nomadic-silos-transforms-small-victorian-town-of-dookie/12053868,Small Victorian town of Dookie comes up with a new moveable take on silo art,"The small Victorian town of Dookie is adding its name to the silo art trail, but in doing so has put a unique twist on the popular art trend. Local arts organisation Dookie Arts, which is behind the Nomadic Silos project, asked local farmers to donate or loan mobile grain silos and then commissioned artists to create a design on them. Dookie Arts committee member Andrew Sands, the director of the project, said they wanted to have their own unique take on silo art.  ""It's been an old idea that I've been mulling over for a while actually. Just to try something a bit different,"" Mr Sands said.  ""We've always tried to do little, artistic sorts of projects.""   There are five grain silos in the collection, each with their own individual design and story behind them.  The silos can be relocated to different areas around the township to encourage visitors to explore the area and see each design.  The town has two larger grain silos that sit off the main road in town, but Mr Sands says while the idea of painting them has been thrown around, the nomadic silos are a point of difference.  ""It's a smaller project that's affordable and doable, without too much of angst in the town,"" he said ""Trying to come up with the right object to be placed on the silo is a big job.""   Grain grower John Petschack, whose family has been farming in Dookie for many years, donated two of his old grain bins after being approached by Dookie Arts.  ""It's making Dookie a much more interesting place. It's making Dookie a more vibrant place,"" he said. ""For people driving through Dookie they think 'wow, there's something happening in this town'."" Mr Petschack said many of the older grain bins no longer suited the more modern farm machinery.  ""We'd really only use it for emergency storage during harvest these days and we haven't needed it for that for four years,"" he said. Artists Tom Day and Domenico de Clario were commissioned to paint the silos donated by Mr Petschack.    Mr de Clairo's piece is inspired by the poetry of Emily Dickinson and he says he has been warmly welcomed by the community.  ""They're so embracing and so welcoming, and so open minded about the possibilities of what the silos might be,"" he said.  Mr de Clairo said this project was a unique take on the silo art trend which had become very popular.  ""It's more approachable, It's more within our human scale,"" he said.   The North East Victoria Silo Art Trail maps out silo and mural art across several small Victoria towns, beginning in Benalla and including the Goorambat and Tungamah silos. The Dookie Nomadic Silos projects hopes to be added to the list.  In the future they would like to create a map of the Dookie moveable silos that visitors can trace the silos' movement through GPS coordinates.  There are already plans to expand the collection of nomadic silos and Dookie Arts is welcoming more donations of grain bins.  ""It'd be nice to get a few farmers on board that would be able to lend their silos, allow us to paint them, and they could keep using them,"" Mr Sands said.   Mr Petschack said he had heard a few rumours that there might be more grain bins that would be receiving a makeover. ""I think there might be a little bit of a competition starting between people to see who's got the best mobile nomadic field bin,"" he said.",ABC Goulburn Murray      By                                 Courtney Howe,"March 24, 2020"
66,/news/2020-03-23/harvey-weinstein-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-prison/12082324,Harvey Weinstein tests positive for coronavirus in New York maximum security prison,"Former Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year prison sentence for sexual assault and rape, has tested positive for coronavirus.   Weinstein, 68, has been placed in isolation at Wende Correctional Facility, according to Michael Powers, the president of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association. Mr Powers said he learned the test came back positive on Sunday morning.  Weinstein arrived at Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison east of Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday after being housed at New York City's Rikers Island jail.   A lawyer for Weinstein said on Sunday night his legal team had not been notified of the coronavirus diagnosis.  ""Given Mr Weinstein's state of health, we are of course concerned, if this is the case, and we are vigilantly monitoring the situation,"" New York-based lawyer Imran Ansari said.   Two prisoners at the Wende Facility have confirmed cases of COVID-19, a state prison official told Reuters.  The official said he could not comment on any individual prisoner's medical record. Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 11 for sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress.   Following the sentencing, Weinstein spent time at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for heart problems, according to his spokesman, Juda Engelmayer.  He also has other medical issues, including diabetes and high blood pressure. Weinstein's conviction last month was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men. More than 100 women, including famous actors, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He has denied the allegations, saying any sex was consensual. Weinstein also faces separate sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.   The former movie producer won an Academy Award for producing Shakespeare in Love and was responsible for other acclaimed films including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient and Gangs of New York.

The social organisation Pub Choir began in Brisbane in 2017 drawing hundreds of people together to learn harmonies and record popular songs. For Couch Choir, singers were encouraged to visit the Pub Choir Facebook where three videos of different harmonies were published to encourage participants to record themselves singing at home.     Event director Astrid Jorgensen said she was overwhelmed by the videos received. ""We wanted to get people to sing without abandon and joining in [with Pub Choir], but with Couch Choir it's with social distancing from the safety of your own home,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""We had more than 1,000 people submit a video of them singing along. I've cried a lot in the last 48-hours."" Ms Jorgensen chose The Carpenters' Close to You as the song for participates to sing. ""I understand the irony [of the song] but it's not just a joke,"" she said. ""I wish we could be closer to one another, but we can't. So it's about longing to be close to each other.""   The videos received were mixed together into a music clip that has had more than 300,000 views since being released on Sunday. ""We had videos from 18 different countries, even one from Bolivia which blows my mind,"" Ms Jorgensen said. Ms Jorgensen returned from the United States a week ago where she was set to attend the South By Southwest (SXSW) music festival to present Pub Choir events.   On her return she undertook a COVID-19 test which returned negative. ""So much has changed in a week. It has been one of the most emotionally draining weeks of my life,"" she said.

68,/news/2020-03-23/australians-saving-their-own-historical-landmarks/12059604,Historic community landmarks saved from demolition by ordinary Australians,"Volunteers across Australia are pushing to preserve historic landmarks in their towns.   Community members in regional and urban areas are fundraising, petitioning and enlisting advocacy groups like the National Trusts of Australia to persuade councils to save historic buildings. Felicity Watson, the executive manager of the Victorian branch of the National Trust, says communities in her state are preserving about 100 historic buildings every year. ""What we find is there are so many competing demands for ratepayers' funds in council areas that it's really up to the community to have a strong voice to put their heritage first,"" she said.   ""We petition to councils to amend local planning schemes to apply heritage overlays over significant buildings."" Set up in each state, the trusts are strong voices that have successfully helped volunteers protect and preserve their treasured landmarks through advocacy efforts. In Castlemaine, regional Victoria, the Castlemaine Market Hall, a 158-year-old building that sits in the heart of town, has almost been demolished twice. It fell into disrepair in the last century, but through the efforts of residents and the National Trust of Victoria, the building was saved and restored in 1974.   The historic hall, built in 1862 was originally home to 22 market stalls, selling fresh produce and poultry while also hosting live animal auctions. It is now the town's tourist information centre and exhibition space. The great granddaughters of William Downe, the architect who designed the market hall, have donated their ancestor's portrait and antique desk to the building's exhibition space. Marion Downe, from Castlemaine, and Margaret Benady, from England, returned the heirloom to commemorate Mr Downe's contribution to the town's streetscape. ""It's lovely to have William recognised this way, but it's really due to the efforts of the local people who did a lot of fundraising and worked in conjunction with the National Trust to save it,"" Ms Downe said.   Castlemaine Historical Society's Alleyne Hockley said linking personalities and real people to heritage buildings allow community members feel more attached to their history. ""It's important to link communities with the personalities of their history,"" she said. ""He was an important gentleman in Castlemaine.""   Ms Watson said many councils in regional Victoria were listening to the National Trust and prioritising their heritage buildings as they are ""real draw cards for tourism and economic development."" In the same year, there were 34.6 million visitors to cultural heritage places across Australia and visitors spent $32.2 billion on cultural heritage tourism. Jane Alexander from Queensland's National Trust said there were several factors that contributed to a historic building being saved. ""These include effective legislation, willing owners, community sentiment and advocacy from organisations like ourselves,"" she said.Ms Alexander said their branch acquired a rare and remote 19th Century brick convent building in Cooktown in the late 1960s, which is now the James Cook Museum.   The National Trusts of Australia are also acquiring buildings to save them from disrepair. Ms Alexander said their branch acquired a rare and remote 19th Century brick convent building in Cooktown in the late 1960s, which is now the James Cook Museum. Constructed in 1888, the convent housed the Sisters of Mercy who provided education to day students and boarders from the Cooktown region. ""During World War II, the sisters and their students moved inland to Herberton and did not return, leaving the convent to gradually fall into disrepair,"" Ms Alexander said.   The National Trust in Queensland restored the convent and it reopened as the James Cook Historical Museum in 1969. In Western Australia, Karl Haynes from the state's National Trust said their branch operates over 50 heritage appeals a year to fundraise and help prevent the loss of heritage places. ""A successful heritage appeal has been the Holy Trinity Church in Roebourne, located 1,600 kilometres north of Perth,"" Mr Haynes said. ""The 1890 church was damaged by Cyclone Christine in 2013, but with the support of community, and grants from the Heritage Council of Western Australia, the National Trust in Western Australia raised over $400,000 and the church's restoration is nearing completion.""",ABC Central Victoria      By Evelyn Leckie,"March 23, 2020"
69,/news/2020-03-22/focus-distraction-digital-mobile-phone-reading-writing/12054712,How to focus when your mobile phone is distracting you from reading or writing,"Every evening I set my phone to ""do not disturb"" mode and try for an hour to read a novel.  But as I attempt to travel to Cherry Beach in Laura McPhee-Browne's excellent debut novel, or the magical world of Philip Pullman's The Secret Commonwealth, or New York City in the 40s in Elizabeth Gilbert's City of Girls, there is still this itch to check my phone. Or moisturise my face. Or consider the encroaching impacts of climate change. Then there is the pull of all the content on the internet. Instead of reading, I could be bingeing Love is Blind on Netflix or falling into a YouTube rabbit hole.   I'm not the only one struggling. The Australia Council for the Arts 2016 survey into Australian reading habits asked how respondents' habits had changed in the past five years, and the results showed 52 per cent of us ""spend more time on social media these days"". It found that while 95.7 per cent of respondents browsed the internet and 92 per cent watched TV, only 65.5 per cent of respondents read a book at least once per week.  The ABC asked Australians about their device usage in the Australia Talks survey last year and found 62 per cent of respondents spent between one and six hours on their devices each day. One-third of the 25 to 29-year-olds surveyed reported using their devices for nine or more hours. The survey also found a third of Australians got anxious after a few hours if they did not check their devices. A high school English teacher has told RN's The Book Show many of his students ""struggle to read the set texts for English, let alone anything else … most of them were big readers in primary school before stopping reading once they gained access to phones"". So how can we turn away from our devices and read again? And how can writers manage distraction? Megan Daley is a teacher-librarian, author of the book Raising Readers and ""curator"" of the Children's Books Daily website. Daley observes that in classrooms in the early 2000s ""there was quite a steep turn upwards in that distracting effect of digital technology"". Now, however, teachers have come to ""infuse their teaching with technology"" and schools have begun teaching mindfulness.  ""If we can give the kids the right skills, like mindfulness and brain training … then we'll be in a golden era of reading and writing,"" Daley says.   Daley describes her phone as a ""24/7 intrusion"" and says one way she manages this intrusion is by locking up her family's devices from 7pm to 7am. ""When I'm feeling manic or distracted, when I can't focus on my reading and writing — I take stock and say 'devices away'."" Though she admits: ""We've had some break-ins: I woke one night to find my eight-year-old getting the keys from under my pillow.""  Cyber psychologist Jocelyn Brewer says our struggles to read or write are less about increased distraction and more to do with how we're consuming information. ""We have a quite ancient brain; our brain has not been updated, we don't have the latest IOS software, but the amount of information we're consuming per day has increased,"" Brewer says. ""For many of us, we used to read a novel, but now we read op-eds about how to get a work/life balance … we're still consuming information, it's just the style of information has changed."" Brewer likens the way we take in information in the digital era to being ""at a sushi train, eating the little snacks that keep rolling by"" instead of consuming ""an enormous plate of lasagne"".   In 2013, Brewer created Digital Nutrition, which is both a concept and service (including therapy and consultation) ""to help guide best practice, balanced tech use and healthy relationships with digital devices"". ""Part of it is stepping back and doing a value clarification exercise and really thinking about what is important and how we can get technology to enhance our lives rather than taking away from us,"" Brewer says. To best consider your digital nutrition, Brewer recommends reading the following books: Indistractable by Nir Eyal, Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, and The Information Diet by Clay Johnson.  Hopefully, you can focus enough to read them. Professor Leah Price is the founder and director of the Rutgers Initiative for the Book and the author of What We Talk About When We Talk About Books. Price told RN's The Book Show you can learn a lot about your reading habits by picking up a book: ""The beginning pages are likely to be limper and quieter when you riffle through them, and the pages in the middle and the end of the book are likely to be crisp and noisy because, depressingly, most books are not read cover to cover,"" she says.   But our failure to finish books isn't a new phenomenon.  ""Readers have always been distracted and multi-tasked and tried to cram their reading into the nooks and crannies of the day,"" Price says. ""We compare our own confusing, chaotic, unsatisfying digital reading life to an imagined golden age of the book in which all books were read cover to cover … [and] everything that was read was a great work of literature. ""But even before the advent of social media and the listicle and all the other forms of digital text under which we're all groaning today, the vast majority of written texts in circulation have always been frankly trivial."" People weren't reading Tolstoy, they were reading newspapers filled with ads and gossip. Price thinks concerns about the future of reading are overblown and points out printed books have survived in the wake of the internet and eBooks. ""One explanation for that is that the book is coming to function … as an antidote to everything that we hate about our digital lives,"" she says. At Perth Festival, three international authors — all heavy Twitter users — spoke with Claire Nichols on RN's The Book Show about how they work through distraction.   Karachi-based author H.M. Naqvi (Home Boy and The Selected Works of Abdullah the Cossack) said: ""I'm conscious of the bounties that social media and the internet provide, but I can't quite do it for long … when I'm working it's difficult to distract me."" But American author Julia Phillips (Disappearing Earth) struggles with the internet.  ""I want to be on it all the time, I love being on it all the time, and I find that it feeds something in me that is the opposite of writing and creativity,"" Phillips says. ""Writing … feels like I'm in control, I get to go into a world of my own making — and the internet for me often feels like really out of control, and really overstimulating, and like a lot is coming in and I don't know what to do with it."" To deal with this, Phillips has set up parental controls on her phone and computer. In contrast, Pitchaya Sudbanthad, the author of Bangkok Wakes to Rain, says he embraces distraction. ""Writers are always distracted; distraction is what eventually becomes books, because fundamentally, writing is a kind of distraction from our real lives,"" he says. ""I think Twitter and the internet and all these things, when done right, can actually feed into that curiosity and become part of the imagination. ""So I don't look on distraction and waste as necessarily bad things. They are part of the weird circuitous route that one takes to write something.""",ABC Arts      By Hannah Reich for The Book Show,"March 22, 2020"
70,/news/2020-03-21/kenny-rogers-dies-at-age-81/12078272,Kenny Rogers dies at 81 after a decorated country music career,"American country singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers has died at the age of 81.   His family announced he passed away peacefully at his home from natural causes. Rogers's entertainment career spanned more than six decades, with chart-topping hits including The Gambler and Islands In The Stream. His family is planning a small private service out of concern for the coronavirus pandemic, and will celebrate his life publicly with friends and fans at a later date. The Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records and won three Grammys. He was also the star of TV movies based on The Gambler and other songs, making him a superstar in the 1970s and '80s.   Rogers thrived for some 60 years before he retired from touring in 2017 at the age of 79.  Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer. ""You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don't invite comparison,"" Rogers told The Associated Press in 2015. ""And I chose that way because I could never be better than Johnny Cash or Willie [Nelson] or Waylon [Jennings] at what they did.  ""So I found something that I could do that didn't invite comparison to them. And I think people thought it was my desire to change country music. But that was never my issue."" A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings.    As a 20-year-old, he had a gold single called That Crazy Feeling under the name Kenneth Rogers, but when that early success stalled, he joined a jazz group, the Bobby Doyle Trio, as a stand-up bass player. But his breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk group, in 1966. The band reformed as First Edition and scored a pop hit with the psychedelic song, Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).  Rogers and First Edition mixed country-rock and folk on songs like Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town — a story of a Vietnam War veteran begging his girlfriend to stay. After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad Lucille in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy. Suddenly the star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade. The Gambler, the Grammy-winning story song penned by Don Schlitz, came out in 1978 and became his signature song with a signature refrain: ""You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."" The song spawned a hit TV movie of the same name and several sequels featuring Rogers as professional gambler Brady Hawkes. It led to a lengthy side career for Rogers as a TV actor and host of several TV specials. Over the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably Dolly Parton. The two were paired at the suggestion of the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb, who wrote their duet Islands In The Stream.   ""Barry was producing an album on me and he gave me this song,"" Rogers told the AP in 2017. ""And I went and learned it and went into the studio and sang it for four days. And I finally looked at him and said: 'Barry, I don't even like this song anymore.'  ""And he said, 'You know what we need? We need Dolly Parton.' I thought, 'Man, that guy is a visionary.'"" Coincidentally, Parton was in the same recording studio in Los Angeles when the idea came up. ""From the moment she marched into that room, that song never sounded the same,"" Rogers said. ""It took on a whole new spirit."" The two singers toured together many times, including to Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and 1987. Over the years they would continue to record together, including their last duet You Can't Make Old Friends, which was released in 2013. Parton reprised Islands in the Stream with Rogers during his all-star retirement concert held in Nashville in October 2017. ABC/AP",,"March 21, 2020"
71,/news/2020-03-21/mary-poppins-queensland-illustrator-recognised/12042834,Forgotten Mary Poppins illustrator finally recognised after international search reveals rare original drawings,"Mary Poppins delighted audiences for generations — the magical British nanny made Julie Andrews famous, Walt Disney rich and delivered royalties and prestige for author P.L. Travers. But there was another character behind the scenes you've probably never heard of. Illustrator Mary Shepard received little credit and little financial reward for her drawings of Mary Poppins, in the series of eight books by Travers. The oversight is something a Queensland academic hopes to rectify. University of Southern Queensland visual artist and researcher, Professor Margaret Baguley trawled through thousands of letters exchanged between Travers and Shepard and is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-ly excited about what she found.   Dr Baguley attended a library at Princeton University in the United States where she discovered the original drawings for the Mary Poppins books, with handwritten notes from both the illustrator and the author — most of which have never been seen before outside of academic archives. Dr Baguley was raised on Queensland's Darling Downs and has had a lifelong love of Mary Poppins. ""My interest was sparked because P.L. Travers lived near where I grew up in Warwick,"" she said. ""She lived in Allora for a short time where her father died, but not many people realised she was an Australian author."" In an effort to reveal Shepard's vital role in Mary Poppins, Dr Baguley examined the P.L. Travers archive at the Mitchell Library in Sydney and the E.H Shepard Archive at the University of Surrey in the UK, but it was the Cotsen Children's Library at Princeton that was her holy grail.   The library held the original drawings for the Mary Poppins books and Dr Baguley received a Princeton research grant to access the library to study the communications between the author and illustrator. ""Something that the other two archives do not have were the original illustrations of the Mary Poppins books with comments from both P.L. Travers and Mary Shepard on the actual drawings with the decisions about how the various illustrations would look,"" she said. ""When I found out Princeton had the actual correspondence and the original drawings for Mary Poppins with annotations all over them, I thought, 'Oh my goodness, no-one has done this before'."" Shepard's father was a well-known illustrator, famous for his drawings in Winnie the Pooh and The Wind in the Willows. Travers first asked him to illustrate her children's books but he declined the commission claiming he was too busy. ""The story goes that she saw a Christmas card that Mary Shepard had illustrated and really liked the whimsical style and asked her to illustrate the Mary Poppins series of books,"" Dr Baguley said. In the early 1930s, Shepard had recently graduated from London's Slade School of Fine Art. ""Travers was 10 years her senior and took on a mentoring role to assist in obtaining the types of drawings she wanted,"" Dr Baguley said. ""Shepard's illustrations provided readers with their first glimpse of Mary Poppins and were critical in helping the reader visualise the stories. ""She really set the aesthetic for how Mary Poppins looked.""   The letters between the women reveal a warmth and an affection for one another but also reveal how the books evolved, Dr Baguley said ""It was such a revelation to see firsthand, through physical artefacts, the process undertaken by Travers and Shepard that resulted in the final images eventually published in the Mary Poppins' books,"" she said. ""Travers sent very detailed letters which included drafts of her stories and rough sketches and ideas for the types of illustrations she would like. ""Mary Shepard would read the stories and the suggestions from Travers and then undertake the complex process of visualising how the particular scene would look by sketching out initial ideas that were returned to Travers for feedback.""   There are handwritten responses on the sides of the sketches that also show how committed both women were to ensuring the illustrations remained accurate to the story. ""The Princeton University Library Research archives also revealed how much research Mary Shepard undertook for the books, including the number of buttons a policeman's uniform would have had in the Edwardian period,"" she said. ""The archives also contained a map of the locations in the Mary Poppins' books which featured the Banks' house in Cherry Tree Lane and surrounding areas, such as the park which helped her to ensure the perspective views in the illustrations were accurate."" The partnership between the two women began amicably but ended badly in a protracted legal battle over the issue of copyright. When Travers reached an agreement with Disney for the film rights in the 1960s after more than 20 years of negotiations, she did not include Shepard in the deal and it impacted their relationship. ""There are letters from Mary that are really quite sad, saying, 'Is there any part in this for my drawings?'"" Dr Baguley said. Shepard didn't get any of the millions Disney made at the box office, but she did manage to get a one-off payment, all thanks to Mary Poppins toes.   Shepard drew Mary's feet in the first ballet position and when her lawyers realised that this was also used in the Disney movies, they had legal grounds for some compensation. ""Mary Shepard's solicitors said, 'Look at the feet, you know when Mary Poppins lands and her feet are turned out, that isn't written anywhere in the book, that's your own intellectual property and Disney have used that',"" she said. ""I think she only received about a thousand pounds for that, something very minimal. ""I also found a whole folder of correspondence where she's [Shepard] having to sell the Mary Poppins drawings at Sotheby's because her house needed repairs …. that was just terrible."" Shepard died in September 2000, largely unrecognised for her role in bringing to life such an iconic literary character. Dr Baguley hopes her research will finally celebrate Shepard's contribution to children's literature. ""People don't even know who the illustrator was and that she's left this wonderful legacy,"" she said. ""In time, both women became less well known than their creations, with Travers' fame subsuming Shepard's and Disney's subsuming them both. ""My work really is to highlight this pivotal role that she [Shepard] had because they're still using her pictures today.""",By Shelley Lloyd,"March 21, 2020"
72,/news/2020-03-21/stella-prize-best-australian-writing-by-women-shortlist-guide/12058776,The Stella Prize 2020 shortlist is your shortcut to some of the year's best books by Australian women,"Writing by Australian women has found a champion in The Stella Prize, which has been spotlighting not just our local heroes but our emerging stars since 2013. The $50,000 prize, awarded annually to a work of fiction or nonfiction, has so far been awarded to Alexis Wright for her collective memoir of Leigh Bruce ""Tracker"" Tilmouth, Charlotte Wood's dystopian novel The Natural Way of Things, and first-time author Vicki Laveau-Harvie for her memoir of family dysfunction, The Erratics — among others. This year's field of short-listed works features three novels, a collection of short stories, a memoir, and a journalist's deep dive into domestic abuse.  Taking you through this six-book reading list are RN's book experts: Claire Nichols and Sarah L'Estrange from RN's The Book Show and Kate Evans from RN's The Bookshelf. The Stella Prize winner will be announced on April 8.     Charlotte Wood won the 2016 Stella prize for her brutal, feminist novel The Natural Way of Things. It spoke to the #metoo movement through its examination of the consequences for young women speaking out against the behaviour of men. Her latest novel is about the lives of women in their 70s.  Just before Christmas, three women who are lifelong friends — Jude, Wendy and Adele — congregate at their dear friend Sylvie's holiday house (somewhere on the NSW coast) where they have the cheerless task of clearing it out after her death. Over the course of the weekend, the women question their relationship with each other in the absence of Sylvie — who, they discover, bound them together. There are awkward, challenging and cringe-worthy moments, with Wood expertly winding a thread of tension around the women as they negotiate the new dynamic.  As with many novels by Wood, an animal plays a key symbolic role. Wendy's decrepit labradoodle represents the questions at the heart of this taut work: how women's lives are shaped by retirement, bodily changes and mortality. The Weekend shows Wood at the height of her literary power. SL     Words matter: at the beginning of this book, journalist Jess Hill sets out her terms of engagement. It's not right, she argues, to use the word ""domestic violence"" when ""domestic abuse"" is more precise. More all-encompassing. It includes control, surveillance, fear, as well as physical violence. It includes the stuff that might be denied, talked down, not taken seriously. Because while this is a book that documents examples of intimate and family abuse, uses stories of real people — gives voice and witness, in other words — it also aims to make a bigger argument about the systems that support this abuse, and to look towards some sort of possible change. Which means this is a collection of shocking testimony, as well as quiet moments of connection across a table or a cup of tea, as women tell each other stories. It's also full of moments of reflection from perpetrators as well. If we've been paying attention, though, sadly we think we already know many of these stories. The strength of Hill's work is to uncover layers we didn't know, and to bring it together in a clear and compelling way; to confront us with her own revelations that she ""used to think I didn't know anyone who'd been through domestic abuse. Now I know that was never true. Now I see its traces all around me."" KE   In the first short story in this impressive collection, a small child is carried across the river on her brother's shoulders. In the next, a woman's body is carried, haphazardly, out of a block of flats. Danger, melancholy and water infuse Here Until August, a selection of ten short stories written by Josephine Rowe over several years. Rowe was previously long-listed for the Miles Franklin Literary Award for her novel A Loving Faithful Animal. In Here Until August, she demonstrates her skill with the short-story form, creating fully-formed and deeply intriguing characters in a handful of carefully chosen words. We meet a French woman afraid to leave her new American apartment, watching terrorist videos on loop; a man rowing a boat out over a sunken town to remember his dead mother; and a newlywed same-sex couple fresh from an argument over who should carry their future child.  As well as being a master of character, Rowe is also an expert tour-guide. The stories are set in locations as diverse as Montreal, the Catskills, and a WA country town — each landscape painted in rich, yet economical, detail. This is the kind of book you'll want to take your time with, luxuriating in the writing of an author at the top of their game. CN     Her grandfather, Poppy Albert, is dead and so August has come home to walk the streets of Massacre Plains, where locals will see her and know she ""must be a Goondiwindi girl"". But she's not back from the other side of the world to see them, she's there to see her grandmother Elsie, to think about her missing sister Jedda, to feel the slap of heat on her skin again. Every step August takes is filled with history: the ancient stories of Ngurambang, where Albert was born; stories embedded in a landscape that features place names like Poisoned Waterhole Creek; and the precarious ownership of Prosperous House, where Elsie still lives. It had been a mission, and now a mining company wants to claim it. Overwhelmingly this is a novel about language, loss and poetry; Albert was making a dictionary that both celebrated the sounds and meaning of memory, and told stories of family and love and relationships. Wiradjuri writer Tara June Winch creates a rhythmic storytelling that combines ancient words with the lives of the people who collected and heard them. This is a delicate and thoughtful read, connected to the sharpest of stories. KE     Favel Parrett's third novel is best described as an ode to grandmothers; in this book, ""old women carry the world"". The story is based on the life of Parrett's grandmother, who came to Australia as an immigrant from the former Czechoslovakia, leaving behind her family — including her beloved sister. Parrett imagines the lives of these sisters separated by oceans and politics, and how this exile shaped them. The reader experiences much of this story through the prism of their grandchildren: Ludek in Prague and Mala Liska, or Little Fox, in Melbourne. The children must piece together the silences of their grandparents, because ""No one ever talked about before … Photos of before were hidden away in the back of cupboards. Stories of before were never told. Before had been forgotten, blacked out."" The story journeys across time and space from 1938 to 1968 to 1980 and back again. A lot of what happens takes place in the confined apartments of the two grandmothers in Melbourne and Prague, but the impact of the 1938 Munich Agreement, Hitler's annexation of part of Czechoslovakia, and the Iron Curtain of the Soviet Union, reverberate through the dreamy narrative. A novel about home, love and grandmothers is a book you can hold close to your heart. SL   Caro Llewellyn's memoir is a story of bodies. It begins and ends with the shock of changes to her own body, and what it means to live with Multiple Sclerosis, but it is also profoundly shaped by her experience growing up with a father who was almost entirely paralysed as a result of polio. He is a vibrant presence on the page: a charismatic man who met and married Llewellyn's mother after his paralysis, who raised a family, who told stories, was full of ideas and schemes and charm. It is also the story of changing family dynamics, estrangements, reconciliations, dramas, relationships, love, poetry, feminism, travel: a life, in other words. But Caro Llewellyn's professional life has also been intimately tied up with the recent story of literature in Australia. She worked in publishing and was the director of the Sydney Writers Festival, before moving to New York for the PEN World Voices festival. So this is also a memoir of writers as personalities, as friends, and occasionally (and intriguingly, given they're not necessarily named) as lovers. This is a complex and often surprising memoir, of an unusual and very well-drawn childhood and an impressive adult life.

73,/news/2020-03-20/population-of-endangered--african-black-rhino-rise/12076484,African black rhino numbers rise as efforts from conservationists pay off,"The number of Africa's critically endangered black rhinos has risen by nearly 800 over a six-year period, according to a new report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).   Conservationists have been trying to save the species, which has been driven to near extinction by poaching. According to the IUCN, the black rhino population saw an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent between 2012 and 2018, with numbers in the wild going from 4,845 to 5,630. But the organisation also said it was a slow recovery and the species remained critically endangered. The IUCN said it expected the growth to continue over the next five years.   Attempts to save the endangered species included relocating some individual animals from established groups to new areas to increase the species range. Some rhinos have been moved out of their home ranges to avoid interbreeding. In June 2018, a group of 11 black rhinos where moved to Kenya's newly created Tsavo East National Park, from Nairobi. All 11 died, most from drinking saltier water than they were used to. One died after being attacked by a lion.   But Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of wildlife charity Wildlife Direct, said the main threat to the animals remained poachers, who targeted them for their horns. ""There are major challenges still facing rhinos today. The first is the demand for rhino horn in Asia. So long as that demand remains, the price will stay high and the incentive for poaching will continue across Africa,"" she said. ""The prevention of poaching requires very good intelligence, extremely good anti-poaching efforts, and that is expensive. It means that we have to have almost a military-style approach to protecting these animals."" The IUCN said overall poaching had decreased, with 892 rhinos poached in 2018, down from a peak of 1,349 in 2015. However, one of Ms Kahumbu's main concerns is lack of space, as increasing human development encroaches on wildlife habitat. ""While numbers might be increasing, where will we put these animals?"" she said. ""They need large and interconnected landscapes. At the moment, we have rhinos in small pockets. ""We have some protected areas, but we haven't got a strategy in Africa at this moment in time to secure continuous protected areas."" ABC/AP ",,"March 20, 2020"
74,/news/2020-03-20/music-venues-fear-they-wont-survive-coronavirus-shutdown/12070540,Fears many Melbourne music venues won't make it through coronavirus shutdown,"It's a city famed for its live music scene, but venue owners in Melbourne say the industry is on the brink of catastrophe because of the coronavirus outbreak, with fears many clubs and pubs won't survive long enough to see performers return to the stage.   The John Curtin Hotel was named after a prime minister who led the country through a war, but in recent times the Carlton pub has been at the heart of Melbourne's live music scene. Owner Ben Russell said the pub's bandroom usually makes up more than half of his business — but after the Federal Government asked for all non-essential mass gatherings to be called off, he cancelled all future gigs. He believes Melbourne's live music scene is facing catastrophe without a government bailout. ""This could be the day the lights went out in terms of live music in Melbourne,"" he said. While the bar and restaurant at his pub are still open, his hotel has lost 80 per cent of its usual business since Saturday. ""We are just getting by, by the skin of our teeth at the moment,"" he said. But the publican knows the bills will keep coming, even while his business is half-closed. He paid about $7,000 last week for his liquor license for the next year. Mr Russell said venues across the city have their liquor-license fees due by March 31, with many hoping for help from the Victorian Government. The state minister responsible for liquor licensing is Marlene Kairouz. Her office said she would be meeting with industry stakeholders on Monday to discuss liquor-licensing fees. But for Mr Russell the biggest hurdle he will face keeping his business running during these times is paying his commercial lease without the usual level of business.  ""A rent freeze would really be incredible, but obviously then there would need to be a mortgage freeze from the banks and a rates freeze from the council, so everyone has to get behind it."" Without significant support Mr Russell said he didn't know how venues would survive the next six months. And he said with many inner-city pubs and clubs like his own sitting in areas of valuable real estate, building owners could consider what else they can do with their premises to make money. He is not the only one worried about how music venues are going to survive. Paris Martine has been booking musicians for Melbourne venues for years. She has booked bands for pubs in Melbourne's inner-north like the Curtin Hotel, the Grace Darling, and the Workers Club as well as the old Billboard nightclub in the CBD, and toured bands from overseas in Australia.   She said the industry has struggled to adjust to the pace with which the industry has been shutting down. She said the fact there were still ""posters for gigs that will never be on the street"", showed how quickly things have changed. Ms Martine believes there has not been enough focus on protecting the buildings that house Melbourne's live music. She was part of an industry emergency phone hook-up this week and said some venues were considering whether they could now afford to renew their liquor license. ""Some venues are looking down the barrel at a $20,000 bill next week and trying to decide whether they can justify paying that bill,"" she said. But the music booker said that for businesses that do give up their liquor license, it may not be easy to re-open when musicians can again perform to crowds. ""The big thing is the licenses are attached to buildings and if we lose those buildings we just won't get them back,"" she said.   She said venues that do forfeit a liquor license are not guaranteed to get a new license or a license with the same conditions they already have, if they do try to re-open down the track. Ms Martine is also concerned about music venues being bought-out for other developments. ""Most venues of significance exist in prominent locations where it is prime real estate,"" she said. Ms Martine said it was important that when live music can return to the city, there were venues still there to be booked.   Melbourne musician Cash Savage has performed everywhere from small Melbourne bars, to large international festivals. Her band had a tour of Europe and a number of festival gigs in Australia cancelled or postponed in the past fortnight, leaving her suddenly without work until September at least.   She is still trying to figure out what she does to earn a living while the coronavirus outbreak shuts down live performances. ""The thing about music is, it doesn't actually pay until the show happens,"" she said. ""Our entire business structure is set up around our live music and touring."" She said it felt like the entire industry was unsure how it would get through this crisis. ""Every person who has any interest in music, or any financial interest in music, is just sitting back and going, 'well, what happens now?' ""It looks really grim, and every day gets grimmer."" While Ms Savage said she was still trying to understand what was happening to her industry and how to get through it, she feared many Melbourne music venues would no longer exist when she could again take to the stage. ""I just can't see how anyone can run a business that doesn't have an income,"" she said. ""I just can't see how the venue industry, how it will look on the other side.""

75,/news/2020-03-19/sydney-artist-anthony-lister-faces-court/12070438,"Street artist Anthony Lister lured and drugged ""young, impressionable"" sexual assault victims, prosecutors allege","Famous street artist Anthony Lister allegedly lured and drugged ""young, impressionable"" art students before sexually assaulting them in his Sydney home, a court has heard.   Lister, 40, was also recorded on CCTV allegedly removing bags of what police suspect was evidence from storage units in Moore Park in late February before his arrest, Sydney's Central Local Court was told. The CCTV footage was captured about two weeks before Lister was charged over the alleged sexual assault of four women, in separate incidents, between 2015 and 2018. He has been in custody since last week when NSW Police raided his Darlinghurst home and one of his studios in Marrickville.  Police prosecutor Kerry-Ann McKinnon today told the court Lister ""lured"" the budding artists to his house and talked them into participating in ""some kind of art activity"". ""These young, impressionable women are drugged and then acts of a sexual nature occur,"" she said during a bail application. Senior Constable Sean O'Brien told the court an Instagram conversation took place on February 27 in which Lister discussed some of the allegations with a woman who police suspect was present during one of the alleged assaults. Lister allegedly wrote: ""After my art show in Wollongong I'm buying a ticket to LA stat"". Senior Constable O'Brien said the storage units, which were rented under someone else's name, were last accessed by Lister the same day as the Instagram conversation. ""We have CCTV of Mr Lister exiting with bags,"" he told the court.  ""We suspect there is further evidence. We are aware he was aware of the investigation at that time and was seen to be leaving the units with items."" Police have already seized about 30 hard drives and a number of USB devices from the storage unit, but they are yet to be analysed. Senior Constable O'Brien said a further two complainants would shortly be interviewed. Lister's barrister, Hament Dhanji SC, said none of the separate allegations against Lister were strong and they relied on the evidence of each of the complainants. He said Lister took part in a police interview in which he denied the allegations and could not be considered a flight risk due to current travel restrictions because of the coronavirus outbreak. Magistrate Clare Farnan said the allegations were ""extremely serious"" and could result in a ""lengthy"" full-time prison sentence.   Lister was granted bail on a $20,000 deposit posted by his mother, and other conditions including not to contact any witnesses. The four original women were aged 18 or 19 at the time of the alleged offences and Lister is also accused of tattooing three lines on one of the complainants without her consent.  Lister, who was born in Brisbane, has become one the country's most internationally-recognised artists and his work has been collected by Hugh Jackman, Pink and Pharrell Williams. His distinctive style and tag appears not only in galleries, but many public spaces around Australia, particularly in Sydney's inner west. In a statement last week, Lister's lawyers said he was ""distressed and hurt"" by the charges and ""emphatically"" denied wrongdoing. The statement said the matter would become a test case on ""the responsibilities of men and women in sexual encounters to themselves and to each other"".",Jamie McKinnell,"March 19, 2020"
76,/news/2020-03-19/john-schumann-takes-action-over-i-was-only-19-coronavirus-parody/12065962,Coronavirus I Was Only 19 parody removed after 'uncomfortable' Schumann speaks up,"Australian music royalty John Schumann was so alarmed at a coronavirus-inspired parody to the tune of his Vietnam vet tribute I Was Only 19 that he asked for it to be removed. But little did he know who created the ditty.   The songwriter and lead singer of Redgum said a mate in the music industry first alerted him to the parody. ""He sent me a text and said 'hey Schuey, are you aware that there's a parody of [I Was Only] 19 up on YouTube around the virus thing?'"" Schumann tracked down the parody on social media.   He said while it was ""clever and amusing"", it made him feel very uncomfortable. So he raised it with the publisher. ""And I said 'look, I'm not up myself or anything, but there is this parody out there and I think it's probably the wrong … song anyway, but it's certainly the wrong time,"" he said. Schumann then took the issue up directly with the creator of the parody via a ""gentle"" note on social media. ""I explained that I was uncomfortable about the parody because first of all it's a sacred song, to Vietnam vets particularly, and other returned servicemen and women,"" he said. ""But also the fact is that a lot of Vietnam vets are quite old now and a lot of them have compromised health. ""This virus, as we know, is likely to be very, very serious for people who are old and otherwise sick. ""So I thought in the context of all of that this was not a good thing to happen.""   Keir Nuttall — the creator of the parody who is also the husband and writing partner of musician Kate Miller-Heidke — immediately removed the material after Schumann contacted him.  ""He explained the situation really clearly, that he's been protecting the legacy of that song for years for the people who've had the lived experience … and it's an immensely important song to a lot of people,"" the Muriel's Wedding co-composer said. As a songwriter, he said Schumann's words resonated with him. ""I've got a song that my wife Kate and I perform about my grandfather's death and I thought how would I feel if somebody had re-written the lyrics to that and made it into a joke,"" Nuttall said.   ""I wouldn't feel great about it. I totally get where he was coming from and so I just pulled it down immediately. ""Both my granddads were in World War II … so there was that connection with a song that was dear to me. ""John also pointed out that a lot of the vets have health issues. They're going to be hard-hit by this thing [coronavirus] and the song's not going to be funny."" Nuttall, who performs musical comedy under his alter ego Franky Walnut, said the idea for the parody was born after realising the similarities by the terms ""COVID-19"" and ""Only 19"". At the time, he noticed the community's increased anxiety about coronavirus and took about an hour to ""whip up"" a tune which he then uploaded to social media. ""It's my instinct to point at the scary thing and laugh, it always has been,"" he said. ""The intention is always, with the sort of comedy I do, is to spread joy, not the opposite. And that's the other point [from John that] I saw immediately.""   Nuttall, who said it was an ""honour"" to be contacted by Schumann despite the circumstances, said the parody attracted more than 3,000 views in 12 hours. He said some people said it was ""sacrilege"" while others were grateful.   ""Most people were just like 'thank you for giving us a laugh' because this thing [coronavirus] is in the foreground of everyone's mind at the moment. So they just said 'thanks for doing it',"" Nuttall said. He said despite requests to re-upload the parody, he believed it would be inappropriate to do so. Schumann applauded Nuttall's swift action to remove the parody. ""I was very pleased at this bloke's response. I think he was very honourable,"" Schumann said. ""He understood, he apologised, he was genuine and sincere and took it straight down. Which was great. ""What it did do was precipitate a very public outpouring of concern and respect for our veterans, both Vietnam veterans and veterans of subsequent conflicts, which is a really good thing.""

""It is with great regret that we have to announce the cancellation of the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam,"" said Jon Ola Sand, the executive supervisor of the event. ""The escalating spread of the coronavirus throughout Europe and the restrictions put in place by many governments … make it impossible for us to host a live event as planned.""   The contest has been held annually since 1956, and was expected to draw up to 200 million viewers and a live audience of tens of thousands for the final on May 16. Organisers said they were not sure where the week-long event will be held in 2021. Broadcasters and the city of Rotterdam will ""continue a conversation"" on hosting the 2021 contest, they said. Eurovision features live musical numbers from each participating country — more than 50 in recent editions — reaching beyond Europe to Israel and Australia. Countries vote for each other's entries in a complex system beloved by fans.   The organization said postponing the event did not make sense, given that it is not known how long restrictions on travel and public gatherings will be in place.   It said a remote or digital version of the show ""would not be in keeping with our values and the tradition of the event"". The Netherlands was to host the 2020 contest after Dutch singer-songwriter Duncan Laurence won in 2019 with a song called ""Arcade"". Mr Sand promised the event ""will come back stronger than ever"".     One of Britain's biggest summer music events, the Glastonbury Festival, was also cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers said the festival, due to take place June 24-28, would be postponed until 2021. Glastonbury organisers Michael Eavis and Emily Eavis said there would ""inevitably be severe financial implications"" for staff, suppliers, charities supported by Glastonbury and more. But they said there was no choice but to call off the festival in light of government advice for people to avoid contact with others.

When Kangaroo Valley's Intan Kallus started sewing last year, she watched YouTube videos to learn the basics and managed to whip up a few pieces. ""I made shopping bags, skirts for my daughter, and then I started classes with Loo,"" she said. She means Kangaroo Valley's design doyenne and couturier Loo Taylor, who runs monthly clothes-making clinics.  Inspired to help out the Kangaroo Valley agricultural show this month, Ms Intan entered three machine-made garments, taking out first and second prizes. ""I'm really proud and really happy. I'm actually really surprised,"" she said.   Ms Intan, who attends The Clothes Clinic sewing classes in Berry and the Valley, works closely with Ms Taylor to pick up more tricks of the trade. ""I had no idea that sewing was such a beautiful activity. It's very relaxing. I absolutely love it,"" she said. For Ms Intan, sewing is the best way to relax and chill out. ""It's very therapeutic,"" Ms Kallus said.     Ms Taylor has always had a passion for textiles. She's a highly skilled pattern maker, which is rare these days. ""Luckily I was of that generation where I grew up with a mother who sewed. She taught me those skills,"" Ms Taylor said. Training at the London College of Fashion and working in high-end couture, fashion has always been a passion.   ""I love the creative process. I get excited by the fabrics. I get excited by the ideas of what I can do with those fabrics, shapes, and new ways of doing things. It keeps me awake at night sometimes,"" she said. Sharing that passion is her motivation for leading public workshops and she encourages everybody to learn to sew. ""It's knowledge that will go to the grave with me otherwise. I've realised there is a whole generation of women who haven't grown up learning to make clothes,"" Ms Taylor said. ""Some women can't even sew at all. ""I think these days we are quite devoid of creative processes in our life.""   Ms Taylor believes cheap, throw-away fashion is one reason women no longer sew. ""I'm really happy that my wanting to teach these skills has coincided with a reawakening of the idea of quality garments made from quality fabrics that are classic and not 'fast fashion',"" she said.   ""It's OK to put hours of work into something if you make it out of good fabric and it fits you, and it suits you and you love it … you'll wear it for years."" A lot of her sewing students comment on how calming they find the activity. ""They love immersing themselves in making clothes and not having to worry about anything else at the time,"" Ms Taylor said.   In a pink weatherboard shop off the main street of Berry, Berry Quilt and Co has been a destination for fabric, patterns, pins and sewing workshops for 20 years. ""It's a place where people come and meet and learn skills. Explore their hobby,"" owner Sharon Thomson said. Ms Thomson is seeing a resurgence of people taking pride in making their own garments. ""People are really considering what they are choosing to make. People are able to come to classes with a pattern they would like to make. Here they can tweak them and make a quality garment that fits,"" she said.

79,/news/2020-03-18/coronavirus-has-decimated-live-music/12062946,"Coronavirus has decimated the live music industry, and it's about more than just your ticket refund","Over the weekend, during a press conference, the chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission requested a bailout from the Federal Government. The season was in doubt due to the escalating threat of COVID-19, Peter V'landys said, and what was at stake was not just its financial viability but the very soul of the nation. ""An Australia without rugby league is not Australia,"" he said. He has since been heavily criticised for his comments — Australia will remain Australia, particularly the parts that don't have NRL teams — but his point was there would be a serious financial flow-on effect for that industry from the Federal Government's decision on Friday to ban events with more than 500 people. The live music sector is also facing an uncertain future. And where the NRL has salaried employees, a $1.8 billion broadcast deal and a profit of $30 million for the 2019 season, the live music sector — which employs 65,000 people and helps generate $15 billion, according to a recent parliamentary report — is a gig economy. What will become of it? Small club tours are not money spinners. Few musicians earn a living wage. At the best of times, major events like Bluesfest and Splendour in the Grass — now cancelled and postponed, respectively — operate under enormous financial risk. Now, without crowds, this sector does not exist.    With Friday's announcement, more than $100 million in wages across the live music industry evaporated, according to ILostMyGig, a new initiative that lets arts workers self-report their earnings. And that's just the ""tip of the iceberg"", said Emily Collins, one of the website's creators.   ""Our business was shut down overnight,"" said Stephen Wade, whose booking agency, Select Music, employees 15 people, six of whom are agents representing about 160 artists. He said he had industry colleagues on the phone to him crying, wondering how they were going to pay their rent. ""This isn't overdramatising,"" he said. ""We've gone from income to zero.""   Melbourne singer-songwriter Alex Lahey has written an open letter to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, calling for help. A professional musician, she said she did not expect any income until November ""at the earliest"". If you add other elements of live performance, like theatre and dramatic arts, the losses projected for a three-month shutdown could be half a billion dollars, according to Live Performance Australia, the peak body. ""We have already seen a number of companies doing checks on their solvency,"" Richard Evans, president of the Live Performance Association, told RN Breakfast on Tuesday. Wade and the LPA were among a group of industry professionals who spoke with the Government on Tuesday to talk all this through. The group said it needed $850 million in urgent financial assistance, arguing few small companies, sole traders, casual or contract workers in the arts would be able to wait out what could be a months-long shutdown.   Jess Beston, who has 20 years' experience in the industry, manages Australian band Holy Holy, and was planning to be working well into winter on a tour that has now been put off. ""For my business, Tiny Monster, that was 90 per cent of my income for that time. And I don't have a huge amount of savings,"" she said. ""And I know there a lot of mangers in the same boat as me."" With so many casual or freelance workers in the entertainment industry, few people have paid leave, according to the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance's Victorian director Adam Portelli. Even venues with capacities below 500 are struggling to stay open, with calls to self-isolate increasing and artists reluctant to ask fans to congregate in bars and clubs. The music industry has started to recover financially in recent years from the devastation of the piracy age.  It is now in shock again.   As one industry figure put it, the live side of the business has had crises in the past, particularly from lockout laws, but never one so widespread as this.   Support Act, which provides relief for music industry workers facing mental health issues or financial hardship, has begun seeking donations, while others are looking at a public awareness campaign to let people know how dire things are.  Artists also say that purchasing merch or records direct from bands, or declining ticket refunds for cancelled shows, could help. And in an industry where passion, not remuneration, must necessarily be a driving factor, many are trying to support and reassure one another. But that reassurance can only last so long. ""We are an industry whose job is to make people happy,"" Wade said, adding performers were often the ones who got behind a cause when the community was in crisis, as seen during the recent bushfires. This time, Wade said, aware of the irony: ""We can't put a fundraiser on to save ourselves.""    ",By music and pop culture reporter Paul Donoughue,"March 18, 2020"
80,/news/2020-03-18/how-to-op-shop-thrift-charity-environment-fashion-abc-heywire/12039256,Sick of wearing the same fast fashion as everyone else? Here's how to op-shop and find the original gems,"We have a bit of a fashion problem. As clothing production prices have come down in recent decades, a new type of design that emphasises making catwalk styles quickly and cheaply to maximise on current trends has entered the scene, fashion expert Dr Alice Payne says.   The phenomenon has a name: fast fashion.  And its impact on the environment is real, the associate professor in fashion at the Queensland University of Technology's School of Design explains. Today, the global fashion industry is responsible for eight to 10 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations. You may already be aware of this and resolved to give your local oppy a go as a result — only to rifle through rickety racks for what felt like an age, before realising it can be harder to replicate the success of more seasoned op-shoppers than it may appear. So, how do you make sure the next time is different? Teen environmental champion Jess is one of those ""angry"" young people you might have heard of who just cannot stop talking about — or protesting against — climate change. November 30 was her first, and only, day off from school in 2018. It was also her first protest.   She has gone on to attend 10 more, and joined her school's environmental league. ""I try and be as sustainable as possible in my everyday life; I'm a vegetarian. I think it's really important to link all aspects of life to your core morals,"" the 16-year-old says.   ""Fashion is a big part of fighting climate change. And that's why I link my fashion and my self-expression to my core moral of believing in climate change and to my belief in preserving the environment."" This means she has pretty much been forced to get thrifting down to an art. Today, her wardrobe is packed with fashion gems sourced from op-shops in and around the Illawarra region of New South Wales. And she is ready to reveal how she does it. The moment Jess walks through the doors of a Canberra YMCA op shop, her eyes track over everything in view. The sheer volume of goods in op shops can be overwhelming, she admits, which is where her first tip comes into play.    Jess says prospective op-shoppers should enter stores with something in mind. ""But then throw it away as soon as you get in the door,"" she says. ""That way if you find that thing you like you'll be happy … but you also won't have any overwhelming expectations."" She begins flicking through the pants section. But rather than being drawn to any pairs in particular, she methodically sorts through everything on the rack. This is her second tip. Eventually, she lands on a pair of belted high-waisted khaki trousers. There is a permanent marker stain on them. Does she put them back? No. Enter her third tip.   ""I'd be pretty happy if I got these in a discount,"" she explains. ""I know I can't wash out permanent marker, but I could probably cut these into shorts. ""With op-shopping, it's really good to find things that are damaged, or maybe don't fit you [and] alter them."" This leads into her fourth tip. ""Look at absolutely everything, even sections that you don't think you'll use,"" Jess says. She explains this is particularly important because you never know what you might find. ""If you look everywhere, pretty much you'd just be able to see what kind of clothes you could adapt.""   To that end, we have tip number five. Jess says op-shoppers should not fear trying clothing that is ""just weird or plain odd"". Trying different things is part of the thrifting experience, but as a conscious fashion consumer, she also cautions against buying things you might not end up actually using, which is her sixth tip.  ""Because in five minutes you'll find something else you're in love with,"" she says. ""But if it sticks with you, then that means it's pretty much meant to be yours.""   By the time we get to her seventh tip, Jess has tried on a handful of children's bucket hats of various colours and noughties-era designs.  She says she knows they could ""look completely stupid"". ""But that's the whole point in trying, having fun with it. I just have fun with most of the things I op-shop.""  In the end, she takes her own advice, realising she does not need another bucket hat at the moment.  What is she missing, however? Why, a mirror decorated with angels holding roses and fine fabrics. If you try these tips across different stores and still do not find the op shop clothes of dreams, never fear.  It may not be much to do with you.    Dr Mark Liu, fashion and textile designer and chancellor's postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Technology Sydney, explains why. ""Some people will have more disposable income than others,"" he says. The fashion researcher says this will influence who is able to buy what — op shops do not exist outside a pricing vacuum, meaning the finer and more ""original"" items can be less accessible. Op-shopping can also be more of a challenge for those who wear smaller or larger sizes than a ""standard"", he says. ""That's just pure chance of genetics and how society works — nothing to do with your body. ""If you're in a shape which is not so commonly catered to, you may find it really difficult to find the same range of sizes. ""It's not really fair to compare everyone with everyone.""   Dr Payne says you should not necessarily let the guilt creep in if you still shop the high street. To her, the way fast fashion garments are used is also important.  ""You want to keep the garments that you invest your money in because that way you preserve the resources that went into making them for longer,"" she says. ""And you want to recognise the contribution of the people who made them. ""By keeping [items] for a long time you're sort of doing that. It's not necessarily that you don't buy fast fashion, it's just that you keep them and use them for longer.""   Dr Liu points out that while a lot of the time the problem is placed on us as consumers, giant companies also play a role in the fast fashion issue. ""And disposing of garments into landfill is factored into the cost of doing their business. Exploitative labour practices are built into the cost of doing their business,"" he says. Dr Liu explains he is not trying to say this means individuals are powerless.  ""We need the activism of young people to keep these corporations in check,"" he says. ""It is up to a generation of justifiably 'angry' young people to take personal as well as political and collective action. ""These actions also have power if adopted by many people.""

81,/news/2020-03-17/coronavirus-covid19-live-music-arts-funding-stimulus-package/12064320,"Coronavirus shuts down live music and arts industry, leaders call for $850m stimulus package","The peak body for Australia's live performance sector is calling for an $850 million stimulus package to save jobs in the arts sector, following an industry-wide phone hook-up with the Arts Minister.   The Minister, Paul Fletcher, heard from 20 industry representatives on Tuesday, including the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), performing arts companies and representatives from peak body Live Performance Australia. Speaking after the meeting, he said coronavirus presented ""significant issues"" for arts organisations and he was there to listen. Live Performance Australia executive director Evelyn Richardson said the coronavirus shutdown would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. ""This is a much longer timeframe than I think people were preparing for — we're planning for four to six months' closure, this is not just four weeks,"" she said. She called for a targeted and immediate support and stimulus package of $850 million to keep people in jobs. ""We're seeing our industry hitting the wall and we need a cultural package,"" she said.  ""It could be part of a broader culture, entertainment and tourism package."" The social distancing introduced to quell the spread of coronavirus — including government bans on gatherings of more than 500 people — has led to a virtual complete shutdown of the live entertainment industry. The industry turned over $2.2 billion last year, not including pubs and clubs.   Music festival Splendour in the Grass is one of the latest major events affected by the outbreak, announcing it would be postponed from July to October.  Many other festivals scheduled in coming months have been cancelled, including Vivid, the Sydney Writers' Festival, Bluesfest, the Other Art Fair and Melbourne International Comedy Festival. For the first time, Melbourne's Art Centre is dark for at least a month and the Sydney Opera House turned off its lights on Monday. Some museums, libraries and galleries have this week announced month-long closures.  Cinemas are still operating for now, but the release of studio films such as the new James Bond have been delayed. In the local screen production sector, work has been frozen on the two biggest movies underway — Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic and Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, after both productions were touched by coronavirus. Tom Hanks is in isolation but no longer in hospital after testing positive last week, while Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton was in isolation while awaiting test results. More than a hundred Hollywood productions have been paused, most of them located in North America but some at other international locations. Netflix issued a worldwide shutdown that also halted director-writer Tony Ayres's series Clickbait in Melbourne. But other local series like Neighbours, Wentworth, Harrow and Five Bedrooms remain in production. The Australian Festival Association, an industry peak body, initiated a campaign to track industry losses.    In just three days, self-reporting on the 'I Lost My Gig' website has recorded $100 million in income lost by small-to-medium businesses and independent contractors, who had 350,000 individual gigs cancelled across the creative industries.  Live Performance Australia conservatively estimates 190,000 people have lost work. One of them is Melbourne comedian and father of two, Josh Earl, one of 500 performers forced to cancel their Melbourne comedy festival shows. Earl was set to earn more than $30,000 for 22 gigs, after $13,000 in costs for room hire and marketing. Earl generates enough income from his paid podcast Don't You Know Who I Am and writes one day a week with Channel Ten's The Project, but he's unsure how he will cover the rest of his family's expenses.   He cannot fall back on his part time job at the State Library of Victoria because that has closed as well.  ""I'm trying to figure it out, not just as a comic but as a parent — that's where my focus is now,"" he said. ""The scary thing is not knowing when it's going to end and we can work again."" It's not just the comedians who face uncertainty — so too do the people who book their gigs. Heidi Pietzner is Josh Earl's manager. ""As a small business owner I started this company a year ago and this month is what I'd banked on,"" she said. Pietzner represents four comics, three of whom had Melbourne Comedy Festival shows. Joel Creasey was one of at least half a dozen comedians planning to donate their time at the Comedy Steps Up for Bushfire Relief fundraiser at the Opera House this week. He's also among the 500 performers who have had to cancel Melbourne comedy festival gigs. That bushfire fundraiser was the last in a series of more than 22 disaster relief events staged around the nation by the comedy sector.  Comedians and musicians have raised more than $10 million for bushfire victims. But the love is being returned. Melbourne International Comedy Festival Artistic director Susan Provan said many ticketholders had got in touch to say they did not want a refund, but wanted to donate their money. The festival has turned its website into a donation portal, where box office and other funds can be directed to comedians and festival support staff. Melbourne Theatre Company stands to lose $1.4 million from the cancellation of its current seasons of Emerald City and Torch the Place and is urging customers to convert their ticket refund into a donation.   Opera Australia has cancelled the remainder of its summer season at Sydney Opera House and its big annual outdoor extravaganza La Traviata on Sydney Harbour. It assured customers they were entitled to refunds but has asked them to consider donating the funds or transferring them into a voucher as it considers selling real estate to stave off bankruptcy. In addition to the legion of freelance workers they engage, the majority of Australia's performing arts companies are not-for-profit and largely break even year-by-year.  Insiders say many organisations are in serious danger of going under. ""No-one knows where this is going to land but where would we be without the entertainment industry?"" Ms Provan said. ""It delivers jobs and joy.  ""Without them, our communities are a lesser place.""  ","By national arts, culture and entertainment reporter Michaela Boland","March 19, 2020"

If the Razzies are anything to go by, these are the films to steer clear of","The annual Golden Raspberry Awards (known as Razzies on the streets) honours the very worst cinema has to offer and this year, Cats was the pick of the litter.  If you've never heard of them, the Razzies were created in 1980 as an antidote to Hollywood's awards season.  Nominees and winners are voted for online by more than 1,000 members from more than two dozen countries, who sign up online and pay a $40 membership fee. The nominees were announced the day before the Oscars (you know, the awards Hollywood *actually* cares about) and now the winners have finally been announced.  Here's how everything fared:   Cats starred some big names: Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, James Corden, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson, Jason DeRulo and Ian McKellen were among them. But even an A-list cast costumed in digitally produced fur couldn't save the movie musical from dominating the Razzies as the worst movie of 2019. Who would have thought? In the end, the big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit stage show of the same name won six Razzies:   In the 40 years the Razzies have run, John Travolta has been nominated for the worst actor award seven times and has won twice.   Travolta sits behind only Sylvester Stallone, Adam Sandler and Kevin Costner for the most worst actor awards — Stallone with 15 nominations and four wins, Sandler with 11 nominations and three wins, and Costner with seven nominations and three wins. The last time Travolta won the Razzie for worst actor was in 2000 for Battlefield Earth and Lucky Numbers (whatever they are).  This year, Travolta won the honours for The Fanatic and Trading Paint (again, whatever they are). Rebel Wilson, of Pitch Perfect, Bridesmaids and — as most Australians would know— The Wedge fame, was nominated for worst actress for The Hustle, co-starring Anne Hathaway. But our Rebel wasn't the worst of these nominees because that honour went to former Lizzie McGuire actress, Hillary Duff.   Duff took the honours for portraying Sharon Tate in the horror thriller The Haunting of Sharon Tate.   And just because we couldn't let that reference to The Wedge go without a trip down memory lane…   Rambo: Last Blood got eight Razzie nominations this year, including worst picture and worst actor (sorry Sylvester). In the end, it won two Razzies for worst remake, rip-off or sequel and worst reckless disregard for human life and public property.   It's the fifth Rambo sequel to the 1982 original First Blood (just in case you were wondering where the 2019 version got its name). With Stallone now 73 years old, Last Blood was sold as the franchise's final instalment. Overall, it did about the same as the previous 2008 sequel, making $19 million in ticket sales during the opening weekend.   He once won the Razzie trifecta by taking out the worst actor, supporting actor and supporting actress awards in a single year for the 2007 movie Norbit. Now, Eddie Murphy has redeemed himself.   Murphy won the Redeemer Razzie for Dolemite Is My Name (available for your quarantine viewing on Netflix). The redeemer award is given to a past Razzie award nominee who has ""become a respected artist"".",,"March 17, 2020"

The Sydney photographer's efforts to capture a chef's passion for his work won him the $50,000 prize, which National Portrait Gallery director Karen Quinlan announced online instead of in front of the expected crowd of finalists and guests. Palmer shot the portrait of chef Josh Niland with a dolphinfish last year, and it was one of about 2,500 submissions to the lucrative annual competition. He said he had struck luck with the image's composition — he was trying to capture Niland in his element and it proved relatively simple. ""You enter these amazing competitions — and I don't enter them very often — and you don't ever expect to win them,"" Palmer said. ""There are times you've got to fight to get an image, you need to craft it, you need to think about what's going to go on and work very hard at it. ""But there are images like this which just sort of present themselves."" He said his aim was to convey the chef's passion for working with the whole fish, from fin to tail. ""Zero waste is his big thing — using every part of the fish — and that is what really inspired the image,"" he said.   Palmer had been working with Niland on a cookbook for more than a week before the right moment presented itself. ""Josh pulled out this massive mahi-mahi [dolphinfish]… He just has so much respect for the food and the fish he works with,"" Palmer said. ""It's just this almost intimate moment between him and his fish."" The judges praised Palmer's finesse; one of them, Nici Cumpston, said the work embodied ""the feeling that the chef has for the fish"". Meanwhile, Hugh Stewart's portrait of dancer Eileen Kramer was highly commended among the 47 other finalists on display at the gallery. Kramer moved back to Australia from New York when she was 98, because she wanted to hear a kookaburra laugh. She turns 105 this year.   And, although the exhibition's official launch was cancelled, the National Portrait Gallery is one of several galleries and museums in Canberra that have chosen to remain open to the public — although public programs and events like the launch have been cancelled. The photographic portraits will be on display until May, before travelling to other venues around the country.

84,/news/2020-03-17/top-tips-for-stunning-bird-photos/12060096,Secrets of stunning bird photos: Award-winning photographer Georgina Steytler and her top tips,"Australia has a spectacular array of bird species, but for nature photographer Georgina Steytler great pictures start with understanding their fascinating behaviour. Mrs Steytler is an award-winning photographer from Donnybrook, Western Australia, who left her career as a lawyer to focus on bird photography and conservation. Knowing how birds behave and they'll respond to her presence are the keys to capturing the perfect moment, she says. ""They could be flying, they could be splashing around having a bath, or they could be warbling and talking to you, as magpies often do,"" she said. And the coronavirus outbreak could present an excellent opportunity for aspiring bird photographers. ""If you find yourself isolated, there would be no better time for experimenting with the birds in your backyard,"" Mrs Steytler said. ""In general, bird photography is better done on your own because birds tend to get intimidated by large groups of people.""   Mrs Steytler shares some of her top tips for capturing stunning photos of birds. Your choice of location can affect not only your chances of encountering birds but also how willing they are to be photographed. ""Go to a place where birds are habituated to people, such as a local park,"" Mrs Steytler said. ""Even if you've got a nice bush backyard, that's perfect as the birds are already used to seeing you.""   It is no secret that ""golden hour"" — the time around sunrise and sunset — makes for the best photos. ""Go when the light's really nice. Avoid the middle of the day when you get a lot of high contrast between shadows and light,"" Mrs Steytler said. ""But you can also shoot on cloudy days because there's a lovely diffused light.  ""The number one thing is to avoid harsh shadows.""   There is a saying in photography: ""If your photos aren't good enough, you're not close enough"". ""People think I use a big lens and I can be on the other side of the lake taking photos but even with a big lens you need to be as close as you can get to the bird to maximise the detail,"" Mrs Steytler said. ""Regardless of what equipment you use, get as close as possible.  ""That's why going to your local park is a great idea, because the birds are habituated to people.""   Often overlooked, but this technique can increase the impact of your photo. ""Get down on the ground, and if you have to commando crawl forward then commando cruel forward,"" Mrs Steytler said. ""The birds are less threatened and they'll let you get closer.""   You want attention to be focussed on your subject and not a ""busy"" backdrop so look for a spot where the background is far away. Using a telephoto lens helps because it produces a shallower depth of field and makes your subject stand out more.   Contrary to popular opinion, you don't need an expensive camera and lenses to take great images. Mrs Steytler said her most popular photo on Instagram last year — a Nankeen Night Heron – was taken with a mobile phone.   ""With phones it's a little bit harder to get closer, so I used a selfie stick and got on the ground,"" she said. ""I crawled closer, pushing the phone out towards the bird as close as I could, and I used a remote shutter. So it can be done.""",ABC Great Southern      By                                 Tom Edwards,"March 17, 2020"

""Couch Choir"" has been organised to replace Pub Choir events that have been cancelled because of the disease. Pub Choir started in Brisbane in 2017, and was created by music teacher and event director Astrid Jorgensen who tried to find a way to get her old friends together for a singalong.   It turned into a phenomenon and every month has attracted hundreds of strangers to come together and learn low, medium and high harmonies to record a popular song. Ms Jorgensen said the widespread ban of events meant more than 12,000 tickets for Pub Choir events had been cancelled. She said the couch event was born out of her own self-isolation measures after returning from the United States. ""I was feeling a bit down because I can't sing with other people in the way I want to,"" Ms Jorgensen said. ""There's so many people feeling isolated at the moment — it's really sad. ""It got me thinking — our singing voices still work. ""It's just we can't be near each other, and Couch Choir is a solution to that.""   For the Couch Choir event, three videos of different harmonies will be released tonight with participants encouraged to record themselves singing at home.  On Thursday, the videos will be collected and mixed together into a video that will be released at a later date.  Ms Jorgensen was in the United States recently to conduct Pub Choir events at the annual South By Southwest (SXSW) music festival in Austin, Texas.   But the fast-changing situation in the US forced the cancellation of the events. Ms Jorgensen said she drove six hours to Los Angeles airport to catch a fight home, arriving back in Australia on Sunday. ""We were so concerned about getting home,"" she said. ""To be in the United States in the last 48 hours … it felt like things were very quickly getting out of hand."" Ms Jorgensen said she has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the results.

In a statement, Mr Walsh said he had been trying to find a way to keep the museum going, but it will have to close due to ""a chance that MONA could become a major centre for contagion"". ""Is there a consequence of closing MONA that I can't foresee, but nevertheless does harm? I don't know, but I'm closing Mona,"" Mr Walsh wrote.

""I thought about conducting tours, or allowing people to register to be invited when the crowd was appropriately underwhelming,"" he wrote. ""I've been trying to find a way to keep going, an option, an excuse.

Staff were briefed on the closure on Monday afternoon.  It is not known for how long Mr Walsh intends to close the attraction, but staff have been told the shutdown will last for the foreseeable future.

It comes as RSL NSW announced it had cancelled all public Anzac Day commemoration services, saying the risk to the public was ""too great"".

Sonya Keller said she was unaware until earlier today when the bride contacted her by text to say some of the guests had tested positive. ""[She] said we should have surely been contacted by NSW Health if there was an issue … nothing at all,"" she said. ""Well as far as I know, all of my staff are well and of course, we are concerned, like everybody. ""It's an unknown thing and now we can take measures now that we know about it."" Dr Chant said it was important that only people with symptoms who had recently returned from overseas be tested for coronavirus. ""If we're swamped with a lot of testing which is of low value, low yield, it actually means that there could be delays for us finding these cases, that are actually putting the community at risk,"" she said. Earlier, the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said police would force people to stay at home if they did not voluntarily comply with Australia's new coronavirus self-isolation rules. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said anyone returning to Australia from overseas would be required to self-isolate for two weeks. The policy came into effect at midnight, and this morning, Ms Berejiklian confirmed police would target anyone flouting the crackdown. ""We do have that provision. We'll be enacting that,"" she said. ""We can't pretend that these are normal circumstances, because they're not. ""We can't pretend that it is business as usual, because it's not.""   Ms Berejiklian also encouraged people to let authorities know if they saw others refusing to self-isolate. ""People should report these cases of people turning up to work when they shouldn't,"" she said. ""If they're engaging in community and social life and they shouldn't, let us know. This morning special state powers were enacted to force organisers and corporations to obey a ban on public gatherings of 500 people or more.  Mr Hazzard said people who failed to comply with the new laws could face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to $11,000. Corporations would face larger fines, Mr Hazzard's office said in a statement. While large gatherings are banned, schools and universities will remain open. Despite that, a primary school in Sydney's south west was closed this morning, after a visitor tested positive for coronavirus. St Christopher's Catholic Primary School, in Panania, is closed for cleaning today.    ",By Emma Elsworthy and Bellinda Kontominas,"April 06, 2020"
88,/news/2020-03-16/ballarat-fire-station-hooves-from-larry-the-firefighting-horse/12056230,"Stuffed hooves of Larry, Ballarat fire brigade's 'magical' horse, back together after 118 years","The four stuffed hooves of Larry the horse have been separated for more than a century, taking pride of place in mayoral chambers and family mantlepieces, and even being used as ashtrays.  But now the hooves, which are steeped in the history of the Ballarat City Fire Brigade, have finally been reunited. Iron grey and described as a ""ladies' man"", Larry the horse stood at 17.2 hands high and was an integral part of the lifesaving efforts of the city's fire brigade from the late 1800s.  The brigade maintains to this day that it is the resilience of Larry, a horse that suffered multiple burn injuries while the brigade battled blazes, drives its culture. Larry met his end on January 16, 1902, after the fire station's bells sounded an alarm for a fire at an outhouse just south of the Ballarat town centre.  Retired and out to pasture, Larry was suddenly called for duty because the replacement horse had gone lame.  Former senior station officer Mal Jones said the story went that no sooner had Larry reached the scene, he fell down dead.  ""He was so well liked that the brigade decided to remove his hooves and have them mounted,"" Mr Jones said.   ""It was decided that two would come to the brigade and two would be given to the station keeper, James McKay, who had driven Larry to fires for many years."" Over the next 118 years, the hooves were taken in separate directions.  ""It could have been brigade legend, but we understand there was one that sat on the boss's desk, and it was used as an ashtray at the old station,"" Mr Jones said. ""The other one was given to the mayor and used as an inkwell in the chambers at the Town Hall, before being returned in the 1960s. ""We didn't know where the other two ended up. I never thought we'd ever see the four of them back in one place."" The great-great-granddaughter of James McKay, Michelle Watson, said the two missing hooves had been passed down through generations of her family, ending up with her father, Max Veal, in Queensland.  Ms Watson said no-one in her family ever questioned why a horses hooves sat on the mantlepiece. ""The strange thing was we didn't know a great deal about it,"" she said. ""They were special, but I don't think we realised how special they were until the other day, when we found out more about it, because dad wanted them to come back to the fire brigade."" Ms Watson said a cousin of her father's had passed through Ballarat during the brigade's 150th anniversary celebrations and had spoken to Mr Jones, who mentioned the missing hooves.  Years later with the connections made, Ms Watson said she was thrilled to able to return the piece of history.   ""I'm quite emotional about it all, [my parents] haven't been back to Victoria for a good few years because of their own health, so they knew that it had to be this time,"" she said.   Mr Veal said he remembered the hooves sitting on his grandmother's mantlepiece when he was a child. He said he thought it was time they were returned.  ""It's quite extraordinary, really,"" Mr Veal said. ""I thought it was a bit silly them sitting on the mantlepiece at home, just dusting them every couple of days, and I thought if we could find out how to donate them that would be great.""    Mr Jones worked at the station for 43 years, and in that time repeated the story of Larry to new members who came to serve the community.  To grasp the importance of the hooves, Mr Jones said you had to understand the central role the brigade over its 161-year history. ""In those days the brigade was like a footy club is today to a small community,"" he said. ""It was the centre and focus for getting people together, and Larry was part of that.  ""He used to attract people, and the ladies would come past and he'd put his hoof up to shake hands. He was a magical sort of horse and was adored."" Country Fire Authority Commander Anthony Pearce, who is Officer in Charge of Ballarat City Fire Station, said the brigade was particularly proud of its history, and the return of the two missing hooves was important in continuing the legacy. ""It's certainly something that this brigade is very proud of, it brings the final piece of the puzzle together,"" he said.  At the handover of the hooves, Mr Pearce said the raw emotion, particularly from some of the past members, was clear.   ""What a romantic story: you think you can become quite clinical when responding to emergencies,"" he said. ""To hear the stories of one animal that just knew what to do when the bells dropped, to be able to move into position for the harness, and the smarts of a member to make an [automatic] harness set-up, is just fantastic. ""The trucks we've got downstairs do a pretty good job, but at the end of the day, you can't replace history like this.""  Mr Pearce said while times had changed since Larry's day, the services remained a key part of the community.  ""There's obviously a lot of sentiment to all emergency services but in particular fire brigades — with the disasters we've had unfold this summer,"" he said.  ""At the end of the day, every single fire agency has come about as a result of the community.""",ABC Ballarat      By Sarah Jane Bell,"March 16, 2020"
89,/news/2020-03-16/behind-drag-queen-courtney-act-is-a-man-struggling-with-identity/11989426,Behind drag queen Courtney Act's sassy exterior was a young man struggling with his identity,"Shane Jenek doesn't seem like a man who struggles with his identity. Dressed in a pink T-shirt and matching pink shorts and looking a good decade younger than his 38 years, he saunters down Sydney's Oxford Street like he owns the place. A British backpacker approaches and asks to pose with him for a selfie. It's a common experience since Jenek and his alter ego, drag queen Courtney Act, won Celebrity Big Brother in the UK two years ago. ""Courtney is huge now in the UK,"" says British comedian Matt Lucas, who contacted Jenek after watching the show and has since become a friend. ""Courtney just won us all over; I think the whole nation was smitten.""   Given Courtney Act's ever-growing global profile, Jenek's visits to Australia are infrequent and invariably packed with engagements. Today he is filming with Australian Story at the Stonewall Hotel, the gay bar he first visited in 1999 as a nervous 18-year-old, fresh from Brisbane. It was, he recalls with a grin, ""the beginning of my big queer life"".  Jenek took to the Oxford Street gay scene like a duck to water, discovering a passion for drag and stepping out as Courtney Act for the first time at the dawn of 2001. Courtney's drag aesthetic was at odds with the post-Priscilla look that dominated drag at the time and she faced some resistance from the old guard. But it didn't take long for Courtney to become a fixture on the scene, winning the drag industry's DIVA Rising Star Award in 2002. But Courtney's confident, sassy exterior masked an identity crisis that would continue for well over a decade.   Drag queens tend to operate on the fringes of society but Courtney is an exception. ""My style of drag is extremely accessible to a mainstream audience,"" Jenek tells Australian Story. ""It has always been very feminine, very sort of female illusion."" In fact, by conforming to stereotypical notions of feminine beauty, Courtney is in many ways more conventional than Shane, who had always been a very feminine boy. Growing up in suburban Brisbane in the 1980s, Shane's appearance, and passion for performance, attracted some hostility from his peers. ""School, for the most part, I found to be quite stressful,"" he says. ""I found it to be quite hard to enjoy and fit in because of bullying or ostracism by, primarily, the boys."" ""I wasn't being bullied for who I was attracted to,"" he explains. ""I wasn't even aware that I was attracted to boys. ""I was just bullied for being different and liking different things."" Just a few years later, however, Courtney was attracting a very different kind of attention from the same kind of boys that had picked on him at school.   Australian Idol judge Ian Dickson, who championed Courtney when she appeared on the first season of the show in 2003, laughs as he recalls Courtney's effect on men. ""When we went on tour together, his dance card was full most nights,"" he says. ""And it wasn't with gay guys, it was with straight guys, who I'm sure had a very interesting internal monologue on their way to work the following morning.""   For someone who had been bullied and rejected growing up, this acceptance must have been intoxicating. ""The idea of not passing as a boy or a man as Shane used to be one of the most threatening things in my identity,"" Jenek says. ""So Courtney was very much a refuge in that I could find a place where I could express my femininity and it could be accepted."" Such was Courtney's popularity that Jenek would even find himself feeling jealous of his alter ego.  ""When I was younger, people would say, 'Can you come to our party, but can you come as Courtney?' And I used to take that personally and I remember feeling like, what's wrong with Shane?"" But such jealousy only hinted at a more profound struggle.   While using Courtney as a socially acceptable way to express his femininity provided Jenek with some comfort it had forced him to compartmentalise his identity. ""Courtney was an extreme and Shane was an extreme and I had just never thought that there was a place in the middle, even though that's essentially where I'd lived for all of my life."" As he reached his thirties, Jenek found maintaining those two separate identities more and more stressful and at times he would wonder whether he should consider transitioning to a woman. ""It was such a point of trauma and struggle in my identity,"" he says.   The turning point came in 2014, when he became friends with transgender activist Chaz Bono, who he met when he appeared on the US reality TV show RuPaul's Drag Race. It was Bono who introduced Jenek to the term ""gender fluid"" — the idea that gender exists on a spectrum and you don't have to conform to one extreme or the other. To realise that it was possible to marry the two extremes of his identity — that it was alright for Shane to be a feminine man — was a transformative moment for Jenek, allowing him to cast off a lifetime of shame and internalised homophobia. ""This idea of gender identity being binary, of male and female, that was the real issue,"" Jenek says. ""Once I was able to break free from that and just accept that whoever I was was correct and allowed and should be expressed, that was the thing that really set me free."" Having come to terms with the opposing forces of his own identity, Jenek found himself less judgemental of others and more willing to engage with other points of view. In 2016, he made a series of videos for Australian pop-culture site Junkee.com, starting with a visit to a Donald Trump rally dressed as Courtney. ""I didn't want to go and make fun of people or tell them that they were stupid, I just wanted to go and try and understand them a little bit,"" Jenek says. ""I think the interviews that Shane did for us gave him a taste of how he could use his profile to educate people on a wider scale,"" says Junkee publisher Tim Duggan. That opportunity came in early 2018, when he was invited to take part in Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, as Courtney and as Shane.   Reality TV had been a constant in Jenek's career but Celebrity Big Brother provided a unique platform. ""Usually on reality television, you're edited down to a soundbite and there's not much opportunity for depth of character,"" Jenek explains. ""But on Celebrity Big Brother there's so much airtime to fill that I was allowed to just talk."" ""Shane was a brilliant communicator because he uses Courtney so effectively,"" Lucas observes. ""You're so beguiled by the way Courtney looks but what she says is often quite challenging and provocative."" But Jenek didn't just talk; he also listened.   One of his fellow housemates was former Conservative politician Ann Widdecombe, who was vehemently opposed to many of the issues Jenek held dear. The expectation was that she and Jenek would clash but while they agreed about little, Jenek surprised Widdecombe by hearing her out. ""The very first conversation we had, we finished and she was like, 'Thank you for that. Normally someone would have called me a homophobe or raised their voice or stormed out and you didn't, you just listened and we just talked'. And she was shocked by that gesture,"" he says. ""I'm sure it wasn't what the producers were expecting, but I think it was gold,"" says Ian Dickson, who watched his former protege proudly from Australia. ""I think it was even better than a faux fight or a bit of reality TV biff."" Viewers were clearly impressed by the show of civility, with Widdecombe and Jenek the final two contestants in the house after four weeks of publicly voted eliminations. When the final votes were counted it was Courtney Act who emerged the winner.   Reality TV might seem an unlikely force for good in the world, but what Shane and Courtney were able to do over four weeks in the Big Brother house was present an alternative to the polarisation that increasingly defines public discourse. ""If you picture two people on either side of the room yelling at each other, not much gets communicated. And I feel that's where the world is at,"" Jenek says. ""If we walk towards the middle, we lower the tone and listen to what the other person is saying, that's the way we change. ""That's the way we evolve."" Winning Celebrity Big Brother made Shane and Courtney household names in the UK. Courtney was invited to appear on news and current affairs show to give her opinion not only on gender issues but also more general topics such as Brexit and the state of the NHS. ""More than being a winner, I came out of the house having a voice, and people being interested in that voice,"" Jenek says. ""And it was so empowering and so exciting to no longer just be a sideshow act.""   Having achieved fame in Britain and the US, Jenek turned his sights once more towards his homeland. Last year, Courtney was runner up on Dancing with the Stars and last week Shane and Courtney finished filming a multi-episode storyline on the long-running soap opera Neighbours. When Shane and Courtney's episodes begin to air next week, it will be another step in a long and steady march towards mainstream acceptance that began with Australian Idol in 2003. You could say that Shane and Courtney are winning over middle Australia, one television show at a time. ""You can have all the Mardi Gras you want,"" says Jenek, ""but if no straight people are coming it's only an internal memo that goes out. You need straight allies to accept queer people as well to take it to the mainstream.""

90,/news/2020-03-15/rocks-bands-turn-to-childrens-entertainment/12027620,From the mosh pit to the sandpit: Why kids' albums are the new rock 'n' roll,"Maybe we should blame The Wiggles.   On the surface, the trend of pop and rock artists swapping pubs for playgrounds to find new audiences seemingly stems from The Cockroaches morphing into The Wiggles in 1991. But the trend of chart-topping acts switching to child-friendly entertainers predates The Wiggles. For example, 1989 ARIA Award nominees for best children's album included Darryl Cotton of 1960s Aussie rock royalty Zoot, and John Schumann of folk-rockers Redgum.   With more rock and pop acts trading the moshpit for the sandpit with a kids' record, is this another sign of rapid change in the music industry and the need for artists to diversify to make a living? Or is the world of kids' music getting cooler, to the delight of parents? The growing generational crossover is artfully demonstrated by dance-rock veterans Regurgitator, who took their genre-melding music to the top of the ARIA charts and even into a ""bubble"" in Melbourne's Federation Square. When they produced a kids' album last year, it wasn't too surprising to many fans. Bassist/vocalist Ben Ely said the genesis for Regurgitator's Pogogo Show and their release The Really Really Really Really Boring Album came from an invitation to play at Dress Up Attack, a Sydney festival created for parents to take kids to see rock bands including Custard and The Grates.    The band took the opportunity to play some of the songs Ely had written with his now-teenage daughters. Mostly amusingly for the grown-ups, Regurgitator re-worked some of their risque material for the G-rated crowd, spawning a version of one of their best-known songs, renamed I Sucked A Lollipop To Get Where I Am. ""It went down really well and felt quite natural for us because Regurgitator is a bit playful in a lot of ways,"" Ely said. He said he sees Regurgitator's Pogogo Show as ""a casual/part-time job that we do occasionally that we enjoy"". ""I don't think we could be kids entertainers full time like The Wiggles or something like that,"" Ely said. ""[But] it's actually quite nice and suits us at our age, especially with the fact that we have kids."" The nominees for best children's album at the 2016 ARIAs were the usual suspects — The Wiggles, Justine Clarke, Play School, and former Yellow Wiggle Sam Moran. The Play School album was notable for featuring several rock acts and pop stars singing nursery rhymes, but it was the fifth name on the nominee list that really raised eyebrows - Pat Davern of chart-topping alternative rockers Grinspoon. Since forming in 1995, Grinspoon has become well-known for their mix of heavy metal, alt-rock and punk-influenced sounds.   For his kids' record Alexander the Elephant in Zanzibar, Davern set aside the distortion pedals, minor keys and squally guitars to bring to life stories his father created. ""He used to make up these stories called Alexander the Elephant to tell to his grandchildren: my nieces and nephews,"" Davern said. ""I said to him, 'how would you feel if I made a musical record (about Alexander)?'... so it was a tribute to my dad."" The album became a kids' book, too, and Davern said the whole exercise was about flexing different creative muscles. He is one of many Aussie musicians who has a ""day job"" outside music, but he said the project was definitely not about diversifying his musical income streams. ""I was under no illusion it was going to make me any money ... would have been nice if it had,"" he laughed. ""It was more just to do something different. It's a bit of a legacy item (for my kids). 'Your dad wrote a children's musical that ended up being a book', which is kind of cool.""   Folk-pop group The Little Stevies were mildly successful, regularly touring Europe and releasing several well-received albums after being ""unearthed"" by triple j in the mid-2000s. But the band, led by sisters Sibylla and Beth Stephen, have enjoyed even greater success as child-friendly project The Teeny Tiny Stevies, spawned out of necessity in 2015. ""(Sibylla) got pregnant with her first child and, looking into the future we thought it wasn't going to work to keep pursuing the overseas path, where you need to go back and back and back, so we diversified,"" Beth said. ""We considered going into musical comedy, which is hilarious because I'm not particularly funny."" The siblings settled on children's music for their new avenue, partly inspired by Sibylla's impending motherhood, and approached the project like a start-up company, Sibylla explained.   ""It was our manager, who happens to be my partner as well, who got real with us and (said) 'you can't keep going overseas every year so ... how are you going to keep being musicians?',"" Sibylla said. ""The Little Stevies were at a point where it was a bit confusing. We'd had a band member leave who was a founding band member, and I was unsure whether we'd make another album again, and I was pregnant, and I freaked out.  ""I was like 'who am I? I've amounted to nothing! And I'm pregnant!'.  ""So for me, when I had my baby I worked so hard to basically just make something of myself. I was thrilled when Teeny Tiny Stevies (took off). I was like 'thank god, I'm amounting to something to show my kids'.""   The Teeny Tiny Stevies is definitely working. Animated versions of their songs appear regularly on ABC Kids, their second album was nominated for an ARIA and they sell out shows around the country. ""(The Teeny Tiny Stevies) are so much more famous than us,"" Beth laughed. They say the success has been built on the ""usefulness"" of their songs, which focus on everything from toilet training to getting dressed. The first album Useful Songs For Little People was inspired by the challenges Sibylla faced with her first child, while the subject matter for subsequent albums has been crowd-sourced from their fans. ""(The music is) literally inspired by what parents are going through,"" Sibylla said. Regurgitator's Ely says the benefits of children's entertainment are two-fold: relief from the rock-star lifestyle, and another income stream. ""We're getting older and doing rock shows where you go on stage at midnight and you get off at 1:30am and then you pack up ... and get back to the hotel by 3:30am and you've got to get up and fly at 7:00am (is harder than) doing these kids' shows where you go to a nice festival and play at 11 o'clock in the morning then it's over and you're in bed at a decent hour,"" he said.  Diversification, he muses, is par for the course for artists in Australia. Ely is a visual artist and creates music for theatre while fellow Regurgitator frontman Quan Yeomans writes music for cartoons. ""If you're an artist, especially in Australia, in any medium ... you do work in a lot of different art forms just to stay afloat,"" Ely said. ""The audience in Australia is not huge and you can't tour constantly, so you do have to diversify and do different things.""  As for the material itself, Ely said The Pogogo Show is ""catering to parents who aren't so precious"". ""A lot of children's entertainment ... cutesifies things and we try to make our content a little bit naughtier and a little bit more upfront,"" he said. ""We kind of encourage bad behaviour in some ways - we're the bad boys of kids' rock. Ha ha, that sounds so weird.""",ABC South West Vic      By Matt Neal,"March 15, 2020"
91,/news/2020-03-15/outback-wedding-dress-maker-melinda-odonoghue/12045238,Wedding dress maker Melinda O'Donoghue spins dreams amid the dust of drought,"On a property at Gurley, about 30 kilometres from Moree in north-western New South Wales, lives a real-life version of Cinderella's fairy godmother. Surrounded by organza, sequins and lace in a beautiful country cottage, you'll find Melinda O'Donoghue. In her bridal studio, a far cry from the dusty paddocks outside, Ms O'Donoghue has been making wedding dresses for more than two decades, and in that time has sent them around the world.  ""It's really strange, I've often picked girls up at the airport in Moree from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth,"" she said of her clients.  ""I've had one girl that's come here from England and one from America.""     And if Ms O'Donoghue makes your dress, she will even travel to your wedding to ensure everything runs perfectly. ""Within reason,"" she added. ""Probably the furthest I've driven is 10 hours. I have flown to Sydney as well. ""I have a theory that bridesmaids are usually too busy looking at themselves, and the mother of the bride is running round like a headless chook, and then the bride is left to get in her dress on her own, so it's good to have someone on hand that's neutral and can help get all that organised.""  She's made about 300 dresses and has plenty of stories to go with each.  ""My signature is buttons and loops on the back of dresses,"" she said. ""I haven't had too many bridezillas, but I've always said one day I'll write a book. ""I've had some extraordinary things happen on wedding days, from priests being three hours late, to dresses coming apart — not ones I've made, but bridesmaids — and all sorts of things. ""I always pack a sewing machine with me.""   Tamworth woman Anna Hall had her wedding dress designed and made by Ms O'Donoghue. ""You can really tell that she just loves weddings and she lives and breathes them,"" Ms Hall said. ""She's so passionate, she's there with you along the whole journey.  ""She travelled three-and-a-half hours each way, she dressed me, she pressed all the bridesmaids' dresses — she even made sure that my Dad was up to scratch, it really was amazing to have her there [at the wedding]."" When Catherine van der Veen contacted Ms O'Donoghue to make her couture wedding dress, she was living in Sydney and a $15,000 designer dress she fell in love with was well beyond her budget. So with only the memory of the dress in her head, she booked a $600 flight to Moree and an appointment to meet Ms O'Donoghue.    ""I found the whole thing a once-in-a-lifetime experience to have a piece of couture made by a classically trained seamstress, and the fact she lives on a property in the middle of nowhere just adds to the mystique of it,"" Ms van der Veen said. ""It was drought when I was having my dress made and it was such a dust bowl out there, but then you step into this room and it's just silk and lace and you just have this magical creature that is Melinda and she just transforms you into this incredible bride.""   Ms van der Veen described the dress to Ms O'Donoghue and she was quickly on board. ""I went and spent $2,500 on a roll of silk and put it on a cattle truck to Moree,"" she said. ""I thought, what am I doing? ""But when it all came together and did what it was supposed to, it was just unbelievable — I don't think either of us could believe that she pulled it off.""  Ms O'Donoghue said it was the biggest challenge of her career.  ""I did have a few tears with that dress ... it ended up having 160 metres of boning shaped into the hem into these bands that twisted and curled, but we got there in the end.""   Ms O'Donoghue even made her own wedding dress with the help of one of Australia's best designers. ""I was doing a little bit of work for Alex Perry and he helped me make my dress.  ""I did some work experience with him at college and then I did a bit of work for him, but that was 25 years ago."" In September, Ms O'Donoghue will be honoured with an exhibition of her bridal creations.  ""It's a bit daunting ... the Moree Plains Gallery are having a 20-year retrospective exhibition of all my brides. ""I've done a bit of a callout to brides to see if they'd lend me back their dresses, and about 80 have offered them to me so far.""   Ms Hall is one of the women on board. ""I think it's such a wonderful thing for Moree to be putting on, I was totally happy to lend my dress, I just loved the thought of it,"" she said. ""The more people that can see her talent the better."" You will find Ms van der Veen's extravagant creation there as well.  ""When Melinda put the call out I was thrilled, because it's a chance to be seen again and to come out of its box,"" she said. ""It's such a tribute to Melinda as well — a lifetime of work and she's brought so much joy to so many people. ""I think she embodies everything that is amazing about rural women, who just work so hard, have so much talent and bring something to the nation, not just their own communities.""   When she's not making wedding dresses, Ms O'Donoghue teaches at the local TAFE; Moree is the last campus in country New South Wales to offer fashion and textiles. ""We're so lucky ... we are very determined to keep the sewing room open here in Moree,"" she said. ""Schools are starting to get back to sewing, which is really nice to see because there was about a decade there when it died a bit.""",ABC Western Plains      By Jen Browning,"March 15, 2020"
92,/news/2020-03-15/arts-entertainment-industry-thrown-into-turmoil-by-coronavirus/12057082,Australia's arts and entertainment industry thrown into turmoil by coronavirus crowd restrictions,"Australians working in the arts industry have reported more than $25 million in lost income caused by bushfires and coronavirus, less than a day after the industry started calculating losses.   Major events across Australia have been cancelled because of the pandemic, including Sydney's Vivid Festival and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. From Monday, the Federal Government is advising all events with crowds of 500 or more people be cancelled. The Australian Music Industry Network and Australian Festivals Association launched a website on Saturday, which allows people in the arts to record the work and income they have lost. The chair of the Australian Music Industry Network, Emily Collins, said the data was only capturing confirmed work that had already been cancelled, and not future losses, or work artists might normally have expected to pick up.   ""A lot of people are talking about, you know, they have lost this much — maybe it is $20,000 on a US tour that has been cancelled in the last week and they are looking down the barrel of having no work for the next six months, possibly more,"" Ms Collins said. She said it was at the stage where industry bodies were concerned about artists and workers in the arts, who usually work on casual contracts or as freelancers, being able to pay for their housing and basic needs. Ms Collins said the survey heard from an events contractor who worked for a company that had cancelled all upcoming work. ""So he has lost any future work for the next three months and his two sons have also lost their work because they work in a similar industry, so there are three people from one household who have lost all income,"" she said. Ms Collins said the industry would be likely to request specific arts and entertainment assistance from the Federal Government, to help workers through the pandemic. ""To make sure the creatives — the people who bring life and colour to our lives — that they don't go under,"" she said. The Federal Arts Minister, Paul Fletcher, will host a roundtable discussion with industry representatives via teleconference on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus impacts and Government responses for the creative and cultural sectors. ""I want to hear about the circumstances the arts is facing and to discuss assistance available, including the Government's recently announced cash flow assistance for businesses,"" he said. Xani Kolac is a violinist on the musical Come From Away, which has decided to end its theatre season in Melbourne early due to the crowd restrictions.   ""I'm so gutted,"" Ms Kolac said.   ""It's been a really, really tragic and scary, stressful week for all the artists and musicians around the world."" It is not the only work that she has lost in the last week. ""All of my gigs up until May have been cancelled,"" Ms Kolac said. Despite this, Ms Kolac said she supports the Federal Government's decision to crack down on crowds to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""I think the health and safety of all the public and artists involved is important,"" she said. ""I think they've made the right call but we're all in a bad spot.""   The entertainment industry's union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), is warning that those losing jobs as a result of the mass event cancellations are especially vulnerable workers, with two-thirds of them casually employed or freelancers. That is double the rate of the larger Australian population. ""The vast majority of these workers are casual,"" the MEAA's Victorian director Adam Portelli said. ""That means they have no paid leave. And come Monday, shifts will be cancelled."" It is not just artists and musicians that have lost work but all sorts of support workers behind the scenes, including tech crews, roadies, road managers, venue managers and bar staff.   Melbourne sound technician Bonnie Knight is a sound technician who has already lost weeks of work. ""The tour I was on just got cancelled. I've had the entirety of my next work of week cancelled,"" she said. ""Both venues I work at are at over 1,000 capacity and it's unclear when they'll go back. It's months' worth of work that's uncertain.   ""It's really stressful. I'd never felt the wrath of being a freelancer because I've always had a lot of different things on the go but now the entirety of it is gone away in one day. ""I feel lucky because I have savings because I had a plan to move overseas in August.  ""I don't think I'll be able to do that anymore which is heartbreaking but it means I have money. ""But pretty much everybody else I know lives gig to gig.""   Ms Knight called on the Federal Government to fund basic minimum wages for people in her industry. ""If they can do temporary basic wage, that would be great."" Mr Portelli said the industry was going to be devastated. ""Already we're hearing of shifts being cancelled. We'd ask employers to reconsider seriously if these shifts need to be cancelled or if workers can be deployed elsewhere,"" he said. ""And if they have to be cancelled, to look at doing the right thing, supporting those casuals and paying them for the period of time they can't be employed at the venue."" The MEAA is calling on the Federal Government to create a stimulus package specifically for the entertainment industry. ""These are the same workers that only months ago were doing free work for bushfire appeals for the rest of the country,"" Mr Portelli said.   Many companies and bands have already lost money due to last-minute concert cancellations. Lorrae McKenna is a band manager for Melbourne group RVG, who were halfway through supporting The Pixies when that Australian tour was cancelled this week. Another of Ms McKenna's bands, Good Morning, was halfway through a US tour when it was cancelled, too.  ""We've lost definitely thousands and thousands of dollars already in travel costs but it could be more,"" Ms McKenna. ""We don't know how much money we'll lose because I don't know when my bands can tour again. They don't know when they can tour again. it's very uncertain. ""It's been a quick slope into a lot of very dramatic changes to our industry."" Even secondary companies that make merchandise for the industry have come to a standstill. Tim Everist runs a Melbourne company that has the contract to make t-shirts for Australian rock band Tame Impala's looming tour in April. As yet, Tame Impala has not cancelled, but it is unclear how long the crowd restrictions will be in place. ""It's just a really surreal time to be in business,"" Mr Everist said. ""Not knowing what's going to happen.""   Some companies are wrangling to keep the industry churning. Ms McKenna said consumer support was paramount to keep the industry going at this tough time. ""If you've listened to a band for a long time but you haven't bought their record, go buy it,"" she said. ""And getting out to the smaller gigs that are still happening is important. ""We can't let that part of the industry suffer.""  ",By Emilia Terzon,"April 06, 2020"
93,/news/2020-03-15/radio-drama-audio-fiction-podcasts-homecoming-limetown-nightvale/12006116,Radio drama and fiction podcasts are having a renaissance as artists make television for your ears,"During the glory days of radio drama in the 40s and 50s, the ABC and commercial entertainment companies were cranking out hundreds of episodes every week — feeding an audience, from Australia and beyond, all glued to the wireless to get their fix of serials like Dad and Dave or The Lawsons. But the advent of TV put a dent in this golden age, and although radio drama was broadcast regularly on the ABC in the subsequent decades, the 2000s saw it decline — culminating with the ABC axing its radio drama show in 2013. Cut to 2020, and audio fiction is enjoying a renaissance.   Homecoming — American indie podcast studio Gimlet's first foray in audio fiction — marked a key turning point, attracting the voices of big-name talents like Oscar Isaac, David Schwimmer and Catherine Keener; it was subsequently adapted into a critically-acclaimed Amazon Prime series starring Julia Roberts. Amazon's Audible, having already cornered the market on audiobooks, has started producing scripted audio fiction, releasing their first Australian content last year, including works by a major playwright (Louis Nowra's The Goodbye Party) and best-selling novelists (like Nikki Gemmell's The Invisible Women's Society). And weekly radio drama has returned to the ABC, with a new radio program and podcast: Radio National Fictions.  ""In the last six months there's been a massive increase in audio fiction in Australia,"" says Erin Kyan, the co-creator of Australia's first LGBT audio drama, Love and Luck. ""Which means that most of it has been in production for much longer — but it's just popping off at the moment.""   Just like streaming has irrevocably changed TV, podcasting has transformed radio. The biggest podcasts are still non-fiction (whether it's Serial, Radiolab or The Joe Rogan Experience) but as funding and air time for radio drama has declined, audio fiction podcasts have been gaining momentum. ""I think audio fiction has been bubbling away and very slowly growing with independent creators,"" says US podcast critic Elena Fernandez Collins. Fernandez Collins says a key release that spurred on other indie creators was American podcast Welcome to Night Vale, in 2012. Using the form of a radio show to explore the spooky happenings in a small fictional town, the podcast became a pop culture phenomenon and spawned two best-selling novels.   Another critical title in the form's evolution is Limetown (2015-2018), about the mysterious disappearance of hundreds of people from an American research facility. Limetown is now a novel and a Facebook Watch series starring Jessica Biel. There are many other fiction podcasts from around the world that have pushed the form into new directions (and the BBC has continually produced radio drama) but Fiona Pepper, presenter of RN Fictions, told The Stage Show that audio fiction has potentially had a bump from the monumental success of serialised podcasts Serial and S-Town. ""Audiences have become obsessed and interested in listening intently to stories and becoming attached to characters and locations,"" Pepper says. ""I can't really afford to go to the theatre or to gigs or to movies and most audio fiction series are free,"" says Nathania Gilson, a Melbourne writer and podcast reviewer for The Big Issue. ""[When you're listening to audio fiction] you forget where you are, whether you are on a commute or taking a walk; you forget your sense of place,"" she adds. One of Gilson's favourite fiction podcasts is Alice Isn't Dead (produced by the Welcome to Night Vale team), which uses audio diaries to tell the story of a truck driver looking for her missing wife. ""When the main character is talking, it feels like she's just talking to you, not the audience; it's kind of like you're in on a secret,"" Gilson says.   The accessibility of the form also appeals to Lauren Gunderson, America's most produced living playwright. Audible commissioned Gunderson to write a play for both the stage and your ears, and last year The Half-Life of Marie Curie opened off-Broadway and was simultaneously released as an audio drama. ""I grew up in a place that didn't have a tonne of theatre and I didn't go to New York until I was much older, and so the idea of having new plays that are on New York stages in my headphones would have been transforming for me,"" Gunderson told RN's The Stage Show. US podcast critic Elena Fernandez Collins says the resurgence of audio fiction has had a positive impact on queer representation.  ""Fiction audio is easily some of the queerest fiction I've ever seen, which honestly carries so much weight in a time where queer-baiting on screen is considered 'queer representation',"" Fernandez Collins says. This on-air representation is driven by the behind-the-scenes creatives who aren't hampered by the gatekeepers of the publishing, TV or film industry. ""With podcasts, you don't have to get a publisher to okay what you want to write, you don't have to get a studio to approve your script … I can make this and nobody has to say 'yes' to me making it,"" says Fernandez Collins. The result is fiction podcasts like ""weird-west audio adventure"" Caravan, written by Tau Zaman and centred around a queer protagonist of South Asian heritage — and Love and Luck, a queer love story told entirely in voicemails.     Love and Luck is made by Erin Kyan, a self-described ""fat, queer, disabled, trans man"", and his partner Lee Davis-Thalbourne, both based in Melbourne. It launched in 2017 and has now surpassed 400,000 downloads. Kyan says that the relatively low cost of producing podcasts has been a boon for marginalised media-makers; for the second season of Love and Luck, he and Davis-Thalbourne made 52 episodes on a budget of approximately $5,000-$6,000 and paid everyone involved. Kyan agrees that audio fiction feels like a queer space, but says, ""it's probably not as big a majority as it feels like it is. We're so accustomed to being just 1 per cent of the media, so if we're more than that, we think we're a lot"". He also points out that audio fiction ""is still very white"". ""There are 10,000 tiny reasons why [audio fiction has taken off again] but I think that the indie fiction sphere has gotten big enough that the people with money noticed,"" Kyan says.   In 2019, Audible Australia launched its first Audible Originals, including fiction— for example, Mark Humphries' media satire Riot Act — and has plans to expand this area in 2020, including releasing an audio season of cult Australian TV series Danger 5. Ben Naparstek, director of content for Audible Australia, sees their offerings as ""essentially binge-worthy TV series for the ears"". Another release on Audible's slate is the scripted sci-fi project Beyond Strange Lands, which is part of a two-project partnership with Screen Queensland that Naparstek says ""will help incubate talent and ideas from the film and TV world"". Using audio fiction as a proof-of-concept for screen projects is something other state screen agencies and production companies are also exploring. ""State of the art sound design is one of the beauties of audio fiction … You can evoke, in a very immersive way, a distant world or landscape using premium sound design in a way that would often be prohibitively expensive on TV,"" Naparstek says.   ""It's hard to break into screenwriting, and the trajectory used to be web-drama — but that's waned and now an increasing number of screen ideas begin with a podcast idea,"" says Pieter Aquilia, the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS) head of screenwriting. In recognition of the resurgence of audio fiction, teachers from the radio and screen courses of AFTRS in Sydney are collaborating to better teach this form to their students. ""Students were asking for it … they wanted more opportunities to play in that space,"" says AFTRS' head of radio, Fyona Smith. Kyan, who has led the way in audio fiction in this country, isn't concerned by the form going mainstream. ""Audio fiction doesn't have the same sort of competitiveness as other podcasts — if someone listens to one, they are more likely to listen to another,"" Kyan says. ""All I ever wanted was more people to start thinking about audio fiction and treating it as a real thing — and that's actually happening now.""",ABC Arts      By Hannah Reich for RN's The Stage Show,"March 17, 2020"

The track, a piece of psychedelic pop released in 2015 by multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker's musical project, beat out songs by Angus & Julia Stone, Kanye West, Sia and others to be crowned the favourite of the last 10 years. Other songs in the top 10 included Somebody That I Used To Know (feat. Kimbra) by Australian singer Gotye at number two, Do I Wanna Know? by Arctic Monkeys at three, Covered In Chrome by Violent Soho at four and Innerbloom by RUFUS DU SOL at five. Foster The People, Gang of Youths, Flume, Matt Corby and Angus & Julia Stone also featured high in the list. The station received more than 1.8 million votes for songs released between 2010 and the end of 2019. Just under half the voters were aged 18 to 24. Speaking to triple j after his song made it to the top spot, Parker said that, ""if I am being honest"", he had a feeling it would win. ""It's a song that has hung around for long enough,"" he said. ""It's like the little song that could. ""I think it has aged well."" Tame Impala have had 11 entries in the Hottest 100 over the years, but this the first number one. ""I can't describe how much of a big thing that is to me,"" Parker said.   Of the 100 artists, 49 were Australian, including eight of the top 10, while 2012 releases featured more often than songs from other years. All the tracks that won the station's annual countdown, including Gotye's and Flume's, made it into the decade list: Meanwhile, a few songs that never charted in an annual list featured on Saturday, including the anthemic Rolling In The Deep by British singer Adele. That came in at number 97 and marked the first time Adele had appeared in a Hottest 100. Flume, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar were among the artists to land more than one song in the 100. When we asked the ABC News Messenger audience last week what they thought might win, Royals by Kiwi singer Lorde, which hit number one in the US Billboard charts when it was released widely in 2013, was a common pick. But it wasn't to be. It instead came in at number 16, prompting a pretty common refrain:   On the phone from her native New Zealand, Lorde, aka Ella Yelich-O'Connor, told triple j she looked back fondly on the period when the song made her a global sensation. ""I was 16 to 18, which is such a pivotal time in everyone's lives,"" she said. ""Mine was going to the Grammys, seeing all this crazy stuff and the world being at my feet in this really exciting way. That will always be indelibly planted in my memory."" Runaway (feat. Pusha T) by Kanye West was also tipped to be a contender for number one, but no luck either for the US rapper, whose song hit number 14.   Innerbloom by Australian band RUFUS DU SOL came in at number five, despite not having made it into the Hottest 100 at the time of its release. The track, which runs past nine minutes, has since taken on a special significance for the station's audience, to the point where even the Flume remix of the track made it into the decade countdown, at number 64.

SA Premier Steven Marshall made the announcement this morning following an emergency SA Cabinet meeting. The latest cases include a woman in her 30s who had travelled from the UK and a man in his 50s who had been in the US. The third new case was a woman in her 80s who had both been overseas and in contact with another confirmed case. South Australia has recorded a total of 19 cases, including a student at Sacred Heart College who tested positive yesterday. ""Six of the people who have been affected have already passed through this illness and have been discharged from hospital,"" Mr Marshall said. ""We have 13 people who are currently isolated, most of those within our major hospitals.""   Mr Marshall attended yesterday's COAG meeting, along with his interstate counterparts and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, during which it was decided mass gatherings of more than 500 people would be cancelled. A national cabinet comprising state and federal leaders has also been established to coordinate responses to the spread of COVID-19. ""We're asking people who are unwell not to come to work. We're asking people to adopt and abide by this norm in terms of social distancing,"" Mr Marshall said. ""We don't want to be using finite resources to test the 'worried well'."" Mr Marshall said Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton — who was later diagnosed with coronavirus — was not at Friday's COAG meeting. ""We certainly haven't received any advice that we are in a cohort that should be tested,"" Mr Marshall said.   Mr Dutton attended a Federal Cabinet meeting alongside colleagues on Tuesday, and Labor has criticised the Government's response to Mr Dutton's diagnosis. ""The Government has advised that they don't need to be tested or self-isolated because there was no immediate contact in the 24 hours prior to symptoms emerging,"" Opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen said. ""The public advice and guidance to people who have close contacts with a confirmed case says nothing about any 24-hour period, it simply says that anybody who has been in close contact should be self-isolated.""   But the nation's chief medical officer Brendan Murphy — who also attended Tuesday's Cabinet meeting attended by Mr Dutton — said there was no need to place himself in quarantine. ""No member of Cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him,"" he said. ""If there had been a requirement for quarantine, [the Prime Minister] was insistent that Government and Cabinet follow those rules."" The number of cases globally has reached 140,000, and the World Health Organisation this week declared a pandemic.   ""We have early evidence of community transmission, mostly in New South Wales but a little bit in other states. We have moved quite early to institute social distancing measures,"" Professor Murphy said. ""We have made the decision early enough so that we can give people a few days' notice to start on Monday, so we can have an orderly transition."" South Australia's chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said one ""difficulty"" had been in speedily accessing flight manifests to notify passengers who had been near those infected. ""We've been working with the other states to try and improve the speed with which we can get the manifests,"" she said. ""The people we are really wanting to be able to contact very quickly are the people who are sitting two rows ahead and two rows behind and to the side.""   A-League side Adelaide United today postponed matches involving its National Premier League (NPL) and NPL reserves teams. The club said a player had been placed in isolation ""as a result of attending Sacred Heart College"". The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra has also cancelled its weekend Gustav Mahler concerts, because a member may have been in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has questioned the decision to delay the cancellation of major public gatherings until Monday. ""I would advise all my vulnerable patients in the community to make a decision and consider whether they should attend and whether they, rather than waiting for Monday, make that necessary step now,"" president Tony Bartone said. Dr Spurrier said while she intended to go to an event this weekend, she urged those who felt unwell to exercise caution. ""We haven't closed any of the Fringe events or other events this weekend, but if anybody is sick — if anybody has a cough, a fever, a runny nose, starting to feel unwell, a bit of a sore throat — please do not go to any of these public events,"" she said.

96,/news/2020-03-14/how-music-is-helping-adelaide-busker-scott-toner/12048566,Adelaide busker credits music with helping him through personal tragedy and 'dark times',"Scott Toner smiles a lot, but the pain still often forces its way out from his broken heart.   ""It's really tough to have fought some of those really dark times and the silence you hear that you haven't heard in so long when you're on your own,"" he admitted. The musician has relocated back to Adelaide from Sydney after a painful divorce. He is part of the Adelaide Fringe's street performers program that puts buskers on show from the city's bustling east end to the challenging confines of the Central Market. But belting out his songs metres from the market toilets, cafes and a busy walkway does not faze the 36-year-old. ""Everything else in the world doesn't matter to me, I get to perform for a bunch of people,"" he said between songs. ""Whether they're throwing money in the guitar case or not doesn't bother me.""   Toner has had to deal with heartache since his teenage years. ""I was 14 when I started playing and my eldest brother had just passed away, so to me that was my first introduction to the healing power of music,"" he said.   Music has come to the rescue again following his divorce, and his struggles to deal with the separation are obvious in many lines in his songs, such as: But the pain's back, these tiny heart attacks, but she is never coming back. Like ships lost in the night, my heart is going to take flight. ""It's that silence that's probably the hardest to get through so if I can fill that silence with something, that's what's completely turned my life around,"" he said. Being a musician is a far cry from his professional beginnings, where he spent several years in corporate jobs in the retail sector. ""Working with thousands of people at once and leading that amount of people, it gave me a lot of life experience I wouldn't have got otherwise,"" he said. ""I also learnt that you have to be true to yourself in what you're doing and … this is such a therapeutic thing to do, music. ""Although you may never be a millionaire, I think the value of the music itself is far more important than the monetary value than you can get in other corporate jobs.""   Toner has 22 self-made albums and has also branched out to produce for bands who would not otherwise be able to afford it. He is also planning to tour internationally, with America a particular focus. Toner does not care about the size of the audience — he just wants to play, be it in pubs and clubs or busking on the streets. ""Some people get touched by it and that's the important thing, whether it's one line out of one song, people connecting with the music is much more important to me than how much goes in the guitar case,"" he said while at the market. ""Even if it's the two-year-old who was here before, dancing, that to me — it plants something in their mind of what they can do.""  ",By Matthew Smith,"March 14, 2020"
97,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478,One coronavirus number will let us know if Australia's outbreak is getting worse,"The vast array of data on the coronavirus pandemic can feel overwhelming, as we all try to make sense of how fast COVID-19 is spreading around the world and the relentless daily count of new cases and deaths. Helpfully, there's one number that can tell us quickly and clearly whether the coronavirus outbreak is getting better or worse. It's called the growth factor. The main thing to understand is this — to be sure we're staying on top of the outbreak, we must keep this number below one. And here is how the growth factor for Australia's outbreak currently looks.   Put simply, the growth factor measures how fast the number of new cases is going up or down. And here's the key point: Calculating the daily growth factor is as simple as taking today's new reported cases and dividing it by yesterday's new cases. Because these numbers can be a little volatile, we're using a five-day moving average of new cases for our calculations.   Of course, the growth factor will change over time. Even though Australia's current growth factor is below one — meaning there were fewer new cases today than there were yesterday — that could change. But for now at least, things are headed in the right direction. Australia looks to be successfully flattening the curve but as public health officials keep reminding us, the fight against coronavirus is likely to be a long one. Even if the number of people sick with COVID-19 gets quite low, the virus could start spreading quickly again without ongoing vigilance. [Want to see how Australia's growth factor compares to the US, the UK and other countries around the world? Keep reading, or skip ahead.] A figure like this is only ever as good as the data being collected. So when reading the growth factor, there are two extra parameters to keep in mind: community transmission and testing. The number of coronavirus cases originating overseas is starting to decrease drastically at the moment, and there's a risk those falling numbers could hide something more worrying — a smaller but rising number of cases caused by spread by community transmission. Experts say the rate of that local spread may be a better indicator of just how well our physical distancing measures are working. It's been difficult to compile data on community transmission. So far, the data we do have only starts in April. It shows little difference in the growth factors for imported cases and local spread. However, there are about 89 cases still 'under investigation', meaning their origin remains unclear.   Another question mark around the data is testing. We will only find cases where we look for them and much of Australia's testing has been focused on people arriving from overseas and their close contacts. Even though Australia has tested a high proportion of the population by international standards, Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says our high testing rate and low positive rate are a ""red herring"".   ""If you're not testing the increasing number of people with symptoms in the community, then you only see what you test for. ""If we can look at that in more detail as we do the breakdown [of community transmission] within Australia I think that's going to be helpful, because I do think it ties to the lockdown. The lockdown is all about community acquisition, not about the boats that came in four weeks ago."" The unknown number of undetected cases currently in the community may prove crucial to keeping Australia's outbreak manageable. Several states have announced they're now expanding testing criteria to include a broader cross-section of the community. So it's important to remember that any rise in the growth factor could be, in part, a result of more widespread testing. ""As we expand our testing we expect it to go up but that doesn't necessarily mean community cases are going up, it means that testing is broadening to capture them,"" Professor Bennett said. Finally, it's worth remembering that even though the growth factor is a great litmus test for how well we're keeping Australia's outbreak in check, other numbers are important too. Now that we understand what growth factor means, it can also provide a useful insight into outbreaks around the world — and how different countries are faring in their efforts to bring coronavirus under control. The following charts focus on the countries with the largest overall coronavirus outbreaks around the world, as well as some of Australia's nearest neighbours.             As you compare those global figures, it’s even more important to factor testing regimes into your thinking. If one country is testing a lot and another is testing very little, it’s going to have a major impact on how their growth factors stack up.

98,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
99,/news/2020-04-10/australians-pool-cash-for-coronavirus-flights-out-of-india/12138010,"As coronavirus cases escalate in India, Australians pool their cash to arrange charter flights home","A group of expats and aviation experts have banded together to organise private charter flights to bring home hundreds of Australians stranded in India.   Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the Government for emergency flights.  ""I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,"" Mr Quinn told the ABC. ""People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.""   Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle.   ""But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,"" he said.  India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases.   ""People assume [Australians] hadn't heeded the calls from home,"" Mr Quinn said. ""The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn't."" As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts.  He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation.   Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" Mr Hempel said.   ""I know it's a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. ""I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out."" The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out.    ""[We're] elated, absolutely stoked,"" Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room.   ""We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare."" The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. ""We were nervous that it still wasn't real until we were literally in the car,"" Mr Munro said.   ""When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.""  Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through.  ""I think it should not have been their responsibility,"" he added.  Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx.   Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India's lockdown.   On April 9, Ms Payne said she had spoken with her Indian counterpart about organising a commercial flight to Australia. ""People think it's quite simple that you order charter flights,"" Mr Quinn said. ""But what people don't really understand [is] there's a lot of complex issues that Australia faced that other countries didn't."" The Australian Government has stopped short of ""endorsing"" the private charter flights, stating government officials and contractors have been instructed to not fly Lion Air until an investigation in a 2018 fatal crash is complete.   But Mr Hempel said he personally had no safety concerns about the airline. ""They're a large airline,"" Mr Hempel said. ""In this case, they've been extremely helpful and at the end of the day they're scrutinised by the [International Civil Aviation Organisation] and the same levels of organisation that Australian airliners are.""

100,/news/2020-04-10/the-rules-of-driving-during-coronavirus/12132208,Can I drive under coronavirus restrictions? How many passengers? Answering your Easter weekend driving questions,"As the Easter weekend approaches, there is a great temptation to hit the road, but authorities have warned drivers to think carefully before grabbing their keys. Conscious of keeping coronavirus under control, police across the country have redoubled their efforts to crack down on non-essential travel. So what is essential? Can you drive to see a partner or a relative? What about a quick trip to a holiday home or for a leisurely cruise around town? Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings. NSW drivers could spend six months in prison, or be forced to pay $11,000 plus $5,500 per day if they continue to break the rules.

102,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
103,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-political-debate-turns-to-a-way-out/12140416,Coronavirus political debate turns to a way out while we endure Easter in a virtual monastery,"Remember how last year's Easter felt bizarre because the country was in election mode? How normal that seems, now everything is surreal, with the nation ""holidaying"" in this peculiar, unpleasant limbo. As we contemplate the grimness we should also remember it could be much worse.  It's early days but we've dodged the horror of Italy, France, Britain, and the US. So far in Australia, the virus is being contained, the ""curve"" of new cases flattened.   Nevertheless, this Easter millions of Australians see little but uncertainty ahead, as they worry about their health, their jobs or lack or them, their businesses. The economic fear inevitably remains dialled high despite a trimmed-down Parliament (only 50-plus House of Representatives MPs out of 151) on Wednesday passing the government's $130 billion wage subsidy package.   Earlier in the week, Scott Morrison had received a Newspoll bounce in his approval, just as Kevin Rudd did in the global financial crisis. Bad as the GFC was, it's clear this crisis will be much more fraught to exit. We are only just into the restrictions but already the debate is intensifying about how and when we get out of them — a result of the relatively good news and people's natural impatience. The question occupying cooped-up households, half-dead businesses, and anxious governments (and their health advisers) is: what now? The immediate answer is simple. We need to endure Easter in a virtual monastery.  When Health Minister Greg Hunt says ""this in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus"", it is likely only a minor exaggeration. The longer term answer to ""what now"" will involve practical and ethical judgements, and contested views.     The exit strategy is uppermost in Morrison's mind — he has always bracketed ""livelihoods"" (aka the economy) with ""lives"" in his language. We're not going to jump from where we are now to that ""other side"" he and others talk about.  We will walk on a long perilous journey requiring complex decisions about steps and timing, with the risk of serious mistakes, and the certainty of pain. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says: ""We are on a life raft. We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.""  The national cabinet has asked its health experts for navigational advice. But the issue always comes back to the health-economics balance. The much-anticipated modelling the government has released didn't provide much of a compass. It told us the obvious: if we'd let the epidemic rip — which we were never going to — the health system would have been overwhelmed. The present policy is one of ""suppressing"" the virus — isolating cases, tracking contacts. Morrison believes it would be too costly to aim to eliminate COVID-19 here — the New Zealand route.   So the future choice is between attempted continued containment until there is a vaccine — a big operation in testing and tracing — or pursuing some form of ""herd immunity"".  The latter would allow the virus to move through the community (while protecting the most vulnerable).   The herd immunity path (there'd be a nicer name) would be very controversial and take more lives than attempting to maintain the suppression approach. Asked on Thursday whether it was possible, when we do unwind the various restrictions, to simultaneously pursue a suppression policy, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said: ""It's entirely possible, and that would need to be the aim. … The suppression strategy needs to be sustainable in the medium term whilst we work out things like when a vaccine becomes available, whilst we bring new molecules online to be able to treat the virus."" What is important as discussion gets underway about lifting some restrictions is that we get transparency on the health advice. This is being promised, but it's no good having modelling long after decisions are made.   There has been more than a dash of ""we know best"" in how the Government has explained things so far.  ""We're acting on medical advice"", it has said, to justify this or that measure.  But the official health advice has sometimes appeared less than consistent, and been criticised by some experts. Morrison has canvassed easing restrictions on a patchwork basis, first in places where and when it seems safest to do so. Those places would in effect be trials for elsewhere. This is logical but won't be easy.  If combined with the continuation of the suppression policy, governments must be willing to reimpose controls if case numbers increase again. And strict health protocols should be in place for how businesses and organisations deal with fresh cases. A present challenge is to manage the pressures from stakeholders and the community for an easing timetable. Innes Willox, chief of the Australian Industry Group, wrote this week in The Australian: ""We need a path back to getting the economy going again. … Businesses owners and their backers will quickly change direction, make other arrangements or move on if they don't have some hope or sense that the current restrictions aren't limitless.""   After an initial period when anyone who criticised the Government was likely to be attacked for betraying ""Team Australia"", a degree of political normality is returning, at a muted level.  Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

104,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-restrictions-fines-disobey-the-law-your-rights/12140644,Coronavirus restrictions mean on-the-spot fines if you disobey the law. These are your rights,"The message to everyone during the coronavirus pandemic is to stay at home and only leave if you really need to for, say, food, health care or exercise. Police now have powers to issue on-the-spot fines to people for breaches of public health orders as part of the coronavirus restrictions. Hundreds of fines have already been issued in many states, for example: Victorian police also pulled over and fined a 17-year-old learner driver for ""non-essential travel"", but later withdrew the fine. This last case shows penalty notices can be overturned. So, what should you do if you have been issued with a notice by police, especially if you think you have been unfairly fined?   Penalty notice schemes allow police to swiftly impose a fixed fine and avoid prosecuting the matter in court. Police and politicians tend to describe their benefit as reducing red tape and cutting costs. But many Australians are unaware of their rights and options if they receive a penalty notice. The following information is not intended to replace independent legal advice. You should also check your state or territory's rules and procedures.   Check the notice for the payment due date.  If you are experiencing financial hardship and cannot pay the fine, contact the fines administration agency to see if you can request an extension or ask to pay by instalments.     The directions of some COVID-19 orders are vague and have been hastily drafted. Many Australians are struggling to keep up with what's allowed and what isn't. Police have also had insufficient time and training to understand the orders, including what constitutes a reasonable excuse. This can give rise to arbitrary — and perhaps incorrect — interpretations of the provisions. You can request an independent review of the police officer's decision to issue a penalty notice. The request should be directed to the relevant fines administration agency before the penalty due date.   If successful, your penalty notice may be withdrawn or you could receive a caution in place of the fine. Grounds for a review may include: Review processes often allow you to provide copies of evidence to support your claim, such as photos and documents. If you disagree with the findings of the independent reviewer you can elect to go to court. A court may find you guilty or not guilty. If convicted of the offence, you may be liable for a larger fine and imprisonment for up to six months. You should seek legal advice if you intend to go to court. The right to seek an independent review or go to court is rarely exercised. As the NSW Law Reform Commission observed in 2012: The penalty notice system does not have the transparency normally associated with justice systems in democratic societies … Most people simply pay the penalty. Only 1 per cent elect to go to court, so that the guilt or innocence of the recipient is rarely scrutinised. If you don't pay the fine by the due date, you will usually be given a reminder notice and may incur additional financial penalties. If you still do not pay the fine by the extended due date, you may receive fines enforcement sanctions, including driver licence or vehicle registration suspension or cancellation, or property seizure.   In the rush to quickly enforce social distancing and social isolation rules, the flaws of on-the-spot fines regimes have received little attention. They do not punish everyone equally. A wealthy person is much less likely to feel the weight of a $1,000 fine — and suffer the consequences of fines enforcement sanctions — than someone who is unemployed or has had their income drastically reduced.   There is also insufficient evidence of the deterrent effect of penalty notices, particularly on those who do not understand the law or what they did wrong, those who are too poor to pay the fine or, alternatively, those who are so wealthy that the fine has a negligible impact. An important aspect of the rule of law is that citizens are made aware of the law so they can moderate their behaviour to comply with it. The speed at which the COVID-19 orders have been introduced, their breadth and their arbitrary interpretation by individual police officers can result in people unwittingly breaching the law and being unfairly punished.

105,/news/2020-04-10/gardening-australia-costa-georgiadis-tips-for-covid-19-isolation/12132902,Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis shares four tips for living in coronavirus isolation,"Costa Georgiadis's chooks are pretty happy right now. Like the rest of Australia, the gardening guru is spending a lot more time at home and, unsurprisingly, in his backyard. ""They're spending a lot more time in the broader garden and actually out on the street as I do work on my street garden,"" he said. ""Their definition of lockdown is free range."" These are troubling times, but for Costa there is ""a big silver lining"", and that's seeing how many people are getting back into their gardens.   So to help you make the most of it, Costa has some ideas on everything from what to plant now to how many chooks you can have (if you can find them), and what to do if you live in an apartment. First of all, Costa wants you to just take a moment to get to know your garden.   ""It's really such a special time in the sense that without the pressures of having to go anywhere, there's this chance to slow down,"" he said. ""One of the smallest and simplest things from a gardening point of view is to actually go out into your garden and just observe what's going on."" It might sound basic, but Costa says most of the time we're just moving through the space — taking the bins out or watering the plants while staring at our phones. So he wants you to try these simple ideas: In other words, look at your garden as a living thing, rather than just a space. ""I talk to children about doing that, but I equally share it with adults because there's so much going on in our gardens that we tend to miss,"" Costa said. There are a lot of things that can go into the ground at the moment. The typically cooler parts of the country haven't yet become too cold, and the hotter northern areas are now starting to become more mild. ""So there's this wonderful, almost spring window,"" Costa said.  ""As far as gardening goes and growing, this is one of the prime slots similar to when we come out in in early spring."" Here are a few options to plant now:   Some of these are quick turnaround and you will be able to start ""repeat havesting"" within 30-50 days. That is, picking off outer leaves and leaving the rest to continue growing. Then you can turn to longer-term vegetables like snow peas, broad beans, broccoli and cauliflower.  ""There's things that we can wait for the full term and there's other things that we can harvest along the way, and those salad greens are a great place to start,"" Costa said. A lack of space doesn't have to mean a lack of garden, and there is still plenty you can grow. Just get experimental, Costa says.   ""Get your celery or your spinach or even your Asian greens, cut them off from the base with about two centimetres or so, then put them on the window sill in a little bit of water,"" he said. ""Things like spring onions — and I've got it going on at the moment with some silverbeet — they'll reshoot and you can literally watch them start growing from the central core. ""Then once they get up a bit and you see little roots you can go out and plant them into the soil and it's just a nice little project."" Other things you can grow in jars on your window sill include mung beans and lentils. Costa says there's no shortage of online tutorials for sprouts. ""That's a great little science project for the kids.""   Costa's chooks like a bit of gardening themselves, especially when he tries to put the mulch out. ""They didn't go to the school of colouring in between the lines, they spread the mulch outside the garden beds,"" he said. ""But hey, they're happy.""   If you're looking to buy some chickens, chances are you're not alone. At the same time there was a run on toilet paper, chicken breeders around the country were also being inundated. If you do want to get some chooks consider how you will keep them. ""You can have a pre-made coop and some of them come on wheels, so you can actually move them across the yard so that they're not fixed in one point,"" Costa said.   In terms of space, Costa says a smaller coop is OK as long as the chickens have space they can be let out to roam around in. About 10 square metres is a good guide. ""That would be enough to have a couple of chickens, and it's always nice to have two rather than one so they've got some company,"" he said.    ",ABC News Breakfast,"April 10, 2020"
106,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-claiming-tax-rent-mortgage/12135048,Coronavirus is changing how we claim tax this year. But what about rent or mortgage?,"If your office is now at home, you may be wondering: does this mean I can claim my rent or mortgage at tax time? In an effort to get you through uncharted waters, we recently published this piece on what you can claim when working from home. With many of us now sharing our work space with our kids, our cats and our dirty dishes, the ATO has introduced a new, simpler method for people to make claims at tax time. It's an 80-cents-per-hour method, which includes all running expenses like the phone, power bills, heating and cooling. But many of you sent through some questions about particular household items. You were worried that if you claimed any home office expenses now that you might have to pay more tax when it comes time to sell your property. So we went back to our experts to find out.   So now that your work space and living space has combined, can you also claim your rent or the interest on your mortgage? Well, it's complicated. But in general, no.   That's because in most cases, your house isn't the main office, studio or place of business, says Andrew Gardiner, spokesperson for the National Tax and Accountants' Association. ""This is the case even though you might be highly encouraged or forced to work from home when dealing with the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. The main exception is if you legitimately run your small business from a dedicated space in your home or your employer does not provide you with an office or work station at their business premises. ""The classic example would be someone who runs a hairdressing salon out of part of their house and they have it dedicated for that purpose,"" Mr Gardiner said. But even then, you can't claim your total rent or the full amount of your interest on your mortgage. You can still only claim a portion, worked out by calculating the floor area of the business space compared to the total property size. Many people sent questions into us, worried that if they made any home office claims, they might get a sting in the tail when it comes time to sell their home — meaning they might have to pay capital gains tax.   Capital gains tax is basically a tax that you pay to the Government when you make a profit on an investment — usually a property or shares. You don't usually have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the home that you live in — it's called the main residence exemption. Fortunately, even if you make claims for home office expenses like the internet, phone, heating and cooling, you won't have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the family home, tax accountant Paula Hart says. ""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat.

107,/news/2020-04-10/south-australia-concern-people-travel-despite-coronavirus-rules/12140466,Holidaymakers continuing to travel despite coronavirus advice ahead of Easter,"Residents on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula have expressed dismay at the number of holidaymakers continuing to arrive in coastal towns, despite advice not to travel this Easter.   Authorities including the Premier and the Police Commissioner have repeatedly urged people to cancel their long weekend travel plans and not to take unnecessary journeys, to protect the community from the spread of coronavirus. ""This Easter, this school holidays, travel around this state is completely and utterly off. We do not want people heading out,"" Premier Steven Marshall said on Sunday. However, Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns including Port Elliott and Victor Harbor, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, have noticed a rise in travellers.   She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had begun arriving in recent weeks, and the local population was still continuing to swell. ""We've got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we're very concerned,"" Ms Green said. ""Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing — the locals have been talking [about this] on social media."" Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town yesterday, despite the fact local accommodation was closed.   She said while some of them were ratepayers who owned holiday houses in the area, she urged anyone who did not need to be in the area to stay away. ""The shops are just packed and no-one's taking the social-distancing rules into consideration, and it's not fair to us,"" she said. ""It's a bit concerning because we've got such an elderly population here, it's one of the high risk areas. ""We want you to come but just not at the moment.""   Coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in South Australia and there have been 421 confirmed cases. ""At the locations people tend to holiday we'll be out in force. We'll have police horses, we'll be using the police helicopter, the police plane, and also drones to monitor areas where we believe crowds are likely to gather,"" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. ""We've also been in touch with most holiday camps and caravan parks. ""People are not welcome in those areas and some shops are refusing to serve people who do not reside in those areas."" Extra police will monitor border control points, ""limiting the opportunity for people to visit those well-known holiday areas"".   Police yesterday confirmed eleven people had been fined after a house party in Port Augusta on Tuesday night, after the group repeatedly ignored directives from officers. ""The crowd were forcibly dispersed,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""We are prepared to show some tolerance … but where this is a blatant disregard for those warnings, we will take action.""     The Commissioner also warned people who spit or deliberately cough to scare others on public transport could be committing an offence. It follows anecdotal reports of people intentionally coughing near drivers or other passengers to cause distress. ""Any action like that, that is done to cause fear of infection may well constitute a criminal offence,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""If those matters are reported and we're able to identify those people we will take action. This is an abhorrent act.""      ",,"April 10, 2020"

Officers pulled over a ute towing a trailer during peak hour on Wednesday on the Pacific Highway at Tugun, on the Gold Coast. They said they found 93 kilograms of cannabis, stuffed in plastic bags, and more than $4,000 cash, bound for Queensland. The drugs have an estimated street value of $450,000. The 31-year-old driver, from the Gold Coast suburb of Palm Beach, is facing numerous charges and was also fined $13,000 for breaching the Chief Health Officer's direction regarding border crossings.   He is on bail and is due to face the Coolangatta Magistrates Court in early July. Of the 70,993 vehicles intercepted at Queensland state borders as of midnight, more than 1,000 have been denied entry to the state. Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast Criminal Investigation Branch said any person attempting to enter the state, even if they were a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny. ""In addition to the current biosecurity risks, police will remain vigilant to disrupt any criminal activity,"" Detective Inspector Ahearn said.",By Holly Richardson,"April 10, 2020"

In Australia, two more deaths have been confirmed, a new $5,000 fine for spitting on health workers has come into effect in New South Wales, and people have been warned to stay at home over Easter. This story is being updated regularly. You can also stay informed with the latest episode of the Coronacast podcast. One in 10 US workers lose their job in just three weeks   Yesterday, Australia recorded its lowest rise in infections in almost a month, with just 96 new cases. But leaders across the country are warning that progress could be reversed if people don't stay at home over Easter. Police are out in force, slapping fines on anyone found to be breaching the rules on physical distancing and non-essential travel. In Tasmania, the Premier warned there would be ""eyes in the sky"". That includes NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin, who has now been fined $1,000 for going to his beach house. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's rate of new infections was only dropping because people had been observing physical-distancing rules. ""It's important because we cannot undo the tremendous progress we have made together in recent times. So this Easter we are staying at home. Don't travel. Don't go away,"" he said. Two more deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed today, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales, taking the national toll to 53. A man who allegedly spat at a Brisbane nurse has been charged with serious assault of a public officer. Police said the incident happened at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's fever clinic on Wednesday. In New South Wales, police will be able to issue $5,000 on-the-spot fines from today for spitting or coughing on emergency service workers or employees going about their duties in a hospital or pharmacy. ""If you had said some time ago, when this crisis started, that people would go out and cough and spit on emergency service workers and people working in pharmacies and hospitals, I would have thought that was remote,"" NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said. ""But we already have seen this sort of activity."" The change under the Public Health Regulation 2012 was signed yesterday after an ""urgent"" request from NSW Health and representatives from unions for healthcare services and police.   The number of deaths in the state of New York has risen by 799, a record high for a third straight day. Meanwhile, New York City increased burial operations on Hart Island, an island where unknown and homeless people are buried, as it deals with dwindling morgue space. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said social distancing was working, and the latest death count reflected the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The number of patients newly admitted to hospital in the state dropped for a second day, to 200. Mr Cuomo said that was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"". New York has now recorded more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19, or nearly half of the total across the country. A University of Washington model often cited by US and state officials projects that COVID-19 will claim 60,415 American lives by August 4, with the peak coming on Easter Sunday. More than 450,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far.   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is now out of intensive care, where he was being treated for COVID-19. The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ""in good spirits"", but he remained in hospital and would continue to be closely monitored. The news came as Britain recorded a slightly lower daily death toll from the virus, with 881 people losing their lives. The day prior, the figure was 938. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Mr Johnson, said the UK had not reached the peak of its coronavirus crisis and it was too early too lift its lockdown. UK officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Mr Raab led a nationwide show of appreciation for health service workers, with people across Britain giving a round of applause — many from their front doors and windows — for the National Health Service as part of the #ClapForCarers campaign. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the UK has recorded 65,863 cases of coronavirus and 7,992 deaths.   The Federal Government says it won't be relaxing coronavirus social restrictions so the nation's sporting codes can start playing again unless medical advice says it is safe to do so. The NRL yesterday said it wanted to restart its competition at the end of May, but Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told Sky News he expected the NRL would have to change its plans again if social restrictions remain in force. ""I'm sure that the NRL would not want to breach plans, I think that they would not want to breach legal requirements,"" he said. ""I suspect that they are making assumptions on where Australia would be at that point in time, and that's fair enough for them. I mean, of course, they've got to plan."" The NRL, along with other major sporting codes such as the AFL, suspended its season as tough rules to stop the spread of coronavirus came into force.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned the country will not return to normal until a vaccine is developed, saying that could be ""a very long way off"". The warning came after Canada lost a record 1 million jobs in March and unemployment soared to 7.8 per cent — with Canadian Government data suggesting the real jobless rate was closer to 25 per cent. Local governments across Canada have ordered non-essential businesses shut to combat the spread. Health officials in the country say the death toll is set to soar from more than 500 currently, with the two most likely scenarios showing between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths by the end of the pandemic. ""While some of the numbers released today may seem stark, Canada's modelling demonstrates that the country still has an opportunity to control the epidemic,"" Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said. Canadian officials say if all goes well, the first wave of the outbreak could end by July or August, but that there would be subsequent smaller waves.   Tired of waiting for a rescue from Canberra, a group of Australian travellers and aviation specialists have come together to organise charter flights for a rescue mission out of India. India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb its rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases. About 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, decided to help. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" he said. The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar.   The United States has reached a grim milestone: roughly one in 10 workers has lost their job in the past three weeks. Another 6.6 million people sought unemployment benefits last week, taking the total number of applicants to 16.8 million since the pandemic hit. It's the largest and fastest string of job losses in records dating back to 1948, and economists in the United States expect job losses could hit 20 million in April. With more than 95 per cent of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, businesses have shut down across the country. Nevertheless, Wall Street closed out its best week in 45 years, with the S&P 500 surging by 12 per cent. The US Federal Reserve has launched its latest effort to support the economy through the crisis, announcing programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.63 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses. The death toll in France has risen by 1,341 to 12,210 people, the fourth highest tally in the world after Italy, the United States and Spain. That figure includes people who died in care homes over the last two days. More encouragingly, the number of people in intensive care has fallen — albeit slightly — for the first time since the outbreak began. In Italy and Spain, which together have about 33,000 deaths, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But Spain's Prime Minister warned that nationwide confinement would likely last until May. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has surpassed 1.5 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.   The International Monetary Fund says the pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth ""sharply negative"" in 2020, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021. Even though governments have already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $US8 trillion ($12.6 trillion), the IMF said it was likely that more would be needed. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" she said. Ms Georgieva said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF would expect a partial recovery in 2021, but she also warned the situation could actually get worse. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook. It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,"" she said. The IMF will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.   Australian churches will be live streaming — and, in some cases, televising — their Easter services so the faithful can still experience them despite the bans on physical attendance. A Good Friday service from St John's Cathedral in Brisbane will be broadcast on ABC TV at 4:00pm. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney will live stream an Easter Vigil Mass at 6:30pm on Saturday, while its Easter Sunday Mass at 10:30am will also be broadcast on Channel Seven. As well, synagogues that will be streaming Passover services include the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, ACT Jewish Centre in Canberra, and Temple David in Perth. Across the globe, Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly-empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside, while in England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video.   UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned the Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a rise in ""social unrest and violence"". He said the United Nations faced its ""gravest test"" since the organisation was founded 75 years ago. ""This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d'etre of the United Nations itself,"" he said. The Security Council, which had been silent so far on COVID-19, issued its first brief press statement after a closed meeting. It expressed ""support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected"".   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia is being evacuated based on medical advice, as the spread of coronavirus in the country continues to surge. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has assessed that the risk of coronavirus in Indonesia is now too high for diplomats regarded as most vulnerable. It's understood Ambassador Gary Quinlan is regarded as a high risk for acute illness if he were to catch the virus. He's being relocated back home temporarily but will continue as ambassador from Canberra.   Australia's consul in Bali has already returned for similar reasons. The ABC has also learnt that an Australian man has died in Jakarta with symptoms of COVID-19, although he was not tested for the disease. At least one other Australian is known to have been severely ill. There have been 280 confirmed deaths in Indonesia, with 3,293 cases. But a low rate of testing means the true number of deaths and cases is likely to be far higher. The number of cases in Indonesia is expected to peak around May.   Iran's Supreme Leader has called on Iranians to create the sense of Ramadan in their homes, since public gatherings are banned as the country tries to contain one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Schools and universities remain closed in the Islamic Republic and a ban on cultural, religious and sports gatherings has been imposed. Ramadan begins at sundown on April 23 and lasts for 30 days. ""Because of being deprived of public prayings, speeches and so on during Ramadan, we should create the same senses in our homes,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech. His remarks came as Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced that Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen by 117 to 4,110. There are now 66,220 coronavirus cases, he said, noting that 32,309 people have recovered.            ",,"April 10, 2020"
110,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"

The Nepali national loves Australia's education system, career opportunities and lifestyle, but chief among his reasons for living and working in the ""lucky country"" for the past seven years is that everyone is treated equally. ""My boss or my manager, I still can put my opinions to them, and that's what really drove me to come to Australia,"" Mr Bhattarai said. From the end of this month, Mr Bhattarai will be without any source of income because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on his tourist-dependent job. Mr Bhattarai is on a foreign visa, meaning he is ineligible for a share in the $130 billion in wage support that passed both houses of the Federal Parliament this week.   The Hobart resident applied for permanent residency two years ago but he is yet to learn whether he has been successful. ""There are people like me who want to contribute to the economy, who are looking forward to the development of themselves and the community as they have been here for so many years,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""We want to help Australia, we want to help create a good version of Australia … and I would request that the Government not put everyone in the same basket."" The Tasmanian Government has worked hard to attract overseas residents to help boost the ageing population and fill gaps in the workforce. The entire state is classed regional, which can help a person's case in applying to become a permanent resident. The Greens tried to amend the Federal Government's JobKeeper package in Parliament on Wednesday to include income support for temporary migrants. Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim said: ""Tasmania has a significant number of foreign workers, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. ""Some business owners are doing their best to look after temporary visa holders with no income, but that should be the Government's job."" People on temporary visas are also ineligible for the JobSeeker payment.   Tasmanian state MP Madeleine Ogilvie described the situation as a ""crisis"", with staff in her office in Hobart's northern suburbs working around the clock to provide support to people like Mr Bhattarai. ""The reality is that we've invited these people here to come study with us, come work with us, come help us and be part of the community, and now things have gotten to a very, very bad stage,"" Ms Ogilvie said. ""At the moment, I don't believe that we as a country and as a state are living up to what we've offered them."" Unions Tasmania has been similarly flooded with calls from people on temporary visas unsure how they will survive without a stable income. ""They pay tax while they're here, they make a contribution, and whilst many of them are not going to be here forever, lots are building their lives here, they're building their home,"" secretary Jessica Munday said. ""We're literally talking about forcing people into destitution and homelessness at a time when we're asking them to stay at home, isolate and stay safe.""   Tasmanian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Simone Zell said member organisations were supporting overseas workers with food and welfare checks. ""The Government is in a position to offer assistance to our migrant visa holders,"" Ms Zell said. ""These people are contributing to our communities and our local economies."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier this week the Government tried to create the broadest and fairest possible JobKeeker scheme but had to ""draw the line somewhere"". The Federal Government will allow migrant workers to access up to $10,000 from their superannuation funds.   Diem Doan has been in Tasmania for about six months, describing it as ""one of the most beautiful states in Australia"". ""It's peaceful, the people here are friendly and lovely and nice, and that drew me,"" Ms Doan said from her Hobart home. ""Also, I want to get permanent residency for the long-term, and Tasmania offers state sponsorship."" After being stood down from her restaurant job, Ms Doan is unsure how she will continue to live in Australia — her home for the past six years.   Her family in Vietnam will provide some financial support, and she will continue to hunt for a new job, she said. ""I still have to go get groceries, I still have to pay for all the bills every month,"" Ms Doan said. ""Luckily my landlord reduced my rent for us, so that's a little support but it really means a lot to us."" Mr Bhattarai said Population Minister Alan Tudge's comment that people who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home was ""heartbreaking"". He and Ms Doan said they were not sure how they would even return to Asia given widespread lockdowns and a lack of flights. ""Australia is one of the countries that has taught me more than my home because I basically did my first job here, I studied my bachelor's here, I have my sisters and in-laws here,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""I don't want to leave Australia because I still want to progress my career, and it's home."" Premier Peter Gutwein said the Tasmanian Government would provide support where it could.

112,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-enforcement-warning-for-easter-weekend/12138518,Easter is 'the most important weekend' in Australia's coronavirus fight as police warn of fines,"On a crucial weekend for Australia's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, leaders have warned there will be no tolerance for breaches of strict self-isolation measures.   Australia's containment controls — including the mandatory quarantine of international visitors, closed state borders and fines for people being outside without a valid reason — have helped ""flatten the curve"" and resulted in fewer than 100 new cases in 24 hours for the first time in three weeks. But Health Minister Greg Hunt warned the Easter weekend was not a time to ease the restrictions. ""As we go into Easter with welcome news for Australia, the virus does not take a holiday, therefore none of us can relax what we do,"" he said. ""This, in many ways, is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus.  ""If we can lock in the gains that we've made as a nation through the courage and sacrifice of those on the health, medical and policing frontlines, but also through the immense goodwill and discipline of Australians, then we can help really protect Australian lives going forward and give ourselves the pathway through."" The restrictions will apply to visits to the beach, attending church services, going interstate or holding large family gatherings.     Each state and territory has announced its own penalties and fines for breaching the restrictions on gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances. State governments have issued strong warnings that police will have helicopters in the air, patrols of holiday destinations and will be using numberplate technology this weekend to find people who are gathering in large groups or who are a long way from their homes.   It comes after several flagrant breaches of the restrictions — including 58 COVID-19 fines for a car rally south of Brisbane, a party at a Sunshine Coast hotel and a man escaping enforced self-isolation in a hotel in Perth and travelling around the city.   Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein warned ""the gloves [had] come off"", announcing a statewide blitz this weekend, including the use of helicopters and police visits to holiday shacks, after reports people were taking campers and trailers to the coast. ""We still have Tasmanians that are flouting the rules,"" he said. ""I have been fair, I have been reasonable and I have taken every step and every precaution that we can to save lives. But we will only save lives if Tasmanians follow the rules.   ""Today we'll be putting helicopters up. There will be eyes in the sky.""   Officers in Victoria will also be checking holiday destinations to enforce compliance, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said. ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you.""   Queensland has introduced a permit for residents returning to the state, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warning ""now is not the time to go into New South Wales"" and refusing to rule out stricter border controls. Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said there were still too many people trying to use beaches, which were closed to ""out-of-towners"". ""Last weekend, we had so many people descend onto the Gold Coast that those social-distancing measures were so extraordinarily difficult to enforce, people were still sunbaking, congregating, and this is what we want to avoid,"" she said. ""What we're saying is please can you just stay home for these next few weeks. You can still get out and do your exercise, but do it locally. New South Wales Arts Minister Don Harwin was forced to apologise and return to Sydney after being sprung at his Central Coast holiday house, despite bans on non-essential travel. The state has also announced $5,000 fines for people who deliberately spit or cough on frontline workers in response to reports of abuse and assault towards people in uniform.

But the number of confirmed cases is only part of the story. An important measure of the spread of infectious disease is the growth rate. One way of tracking growth is by looking at the daily percentage change in total confirmed cases. This shows Australia's growth rate has fallen from a peak of more than 25 per cent in mid-March to less than 5 per cent in early April, based on the five-day moving average. The aim is to reach zero — and stay there. Another way of measuring the spread of disease is by how long it takes the number of confirmed cases to double — also known as the ""doubling time"". This is easier to see when the number of confirmed cases is plotted on a log scale.  On the chart above, each tick on the vertical axis is 10 times the value of the previous tick. The slope of the line shows how long it takes the number of cases to rise from 10 to 100 to 1000, and so on. The steeper the line, the faster the growth rate. It shows that for most of March, Australia's count of confirmed cases doubled every 3-4 days. However, there are signs it is slowing — although experts warn the trend may not be sustained. Here is the same chart but for each of the states and territories. It shows the largest states are on roughly the same growth trajectory. A similar kind of chart can be used to compare Australia's growth rate to other countries.  This one uses the same log scale but rather than exact dates, it tracks each country's cumulative case count from the day that country reached 100 cases. This brings each country onto the same timeline. It shows that in many countries, including Australia, the number of confirmed infections grew rapidly early in the outbreak, doubling every 3 days or less.  In other countries, such as Japan and Singapore, initial growth rates were slower, with cases taking a week or more to double . The chart also shows that countries such as South Korea and China started with very steep growth rates but now have much flatter lines, which means they have successfully slowed their growth rates. (For more on how other countries are winning the fight against COVID-19, read this analysis.) Figures for Australia show ___ has the most confirmed cases, making up ___ of the total number of infections, followed by ___ and ___. However, the picture shifts when population size is taken into account.  Adjusting the figures for the number of residents shows ___ still has the highest number of infections per 100,000 residents, but it is followed by ___, then ___. ___ has the lowest infections per 100,000, followed by ___. Nationally, ___ people have died — __. At least 17 deaths across the country were of cruise ships passengers. Figures show __ people have recovered from the disease, leaving ___ confirmed cases still current or ""active"". The vast majority of current cases do not require hospitalisation.  The chart below shows the number of people in hospital (including in ICU and ventilated) as a percentage of current cases in each state and territory. Nationally, __ people (or __ per cent of current cases) are receiving hospital care, including __ (or __ per cent of current cases) in ICU.  Of those in ICU, __ (__ per cent of current cases) are ventilated. (Figures for the number of ventilated patients in WA are pending.) These hospitalisation figures are based on a snapshot of a point in time, rather than a cumulative count of patients hospitalised since the virus was first detected in Australia. It is important to note that case numbers and diagnosis rates are heavily influenced by the rate of testing.  At roughly 1,250 tests per 100,000 residents, Australia's rate of testing per capita is among the highest in the world, according to figures from Our World in Data. However, federal government figures show the number of tests added each day — think of this as similar to the daily ""growth rate"" of tests — has fallen in recent weeks. It is unclear how much this has influenced the apparent slowdown in new diagnoses. The bars in this chart show the cumulative number of samples tested each day in Australia. The lines show the percentage change (or ""growth rate"") in the cumulative number of tests. Nationally, the number of tests added each day has fallen from a peak of 8 per cent on March 26 to less than 4 per cent since April 7, based on the 5-day moving average. Notably, this decline has coincided with the expansion of coronavirus testing criteria.  Some experts have linked the fall to lower numbers of returned travellers. Others have attributed it to fewer people presenting with symptoms. A breakdown of total tests by jurisdiction shows ___ has tested the most samples of any state or territory, followed by ___ then ___. However, adjusting for population shows ___ has the highest rate of testing, at roughly ___ the rate in ___, which has the nation's lowest rate of testing. ___ and ___ have the second- and third-highest rates of testing, respectively. Data on the percentage of tests that come back positive for COVID-19 show __, then __ and ___, have the highest positive test rates, while ___ and ___ have the lowest.  Again, this is influenced by testing rates, since the broader the testing regime, the lower the odds of finding positive cases.  Another way of looking at rates of testing is to compare the number of residents to the number of tests, both as a share of the national total. ___ accounts for ___ of Australia’s population but ___ of samples tested in Australia, while __ accounts for ___ of the population but ___ of tests. By contrast, ___ makes up ___ of the population but only ___ of tests. Similarly, ___ accounts for just over ___ of Australia's population, but only ___ of tests. People ___ have the most confirmed cases of any age group. However, adjusting these numbers for the size of each age group shows people __ have the highest rate of confirmed cases.  They are followed by people __ and people  __, and then those ___. When a case is confirmed, health authorities undertake detailed tracing to identify the source of transmission. Nationally, ___ of cases were acquired overseas, while ___ were acquired locally. This includes ___ transmitted locally with no known link to a confirmed case or cluster. A breakdown of the data by gender suggests little difference in the rate of diagnosis between men and women.     Dates refer to the date the case was reported by authorities, except in these instances: - The 5th, 6th and 7th confirmed cases in Victoria have been assigned to the date they were first cited in official press releases. These cases were first announced on March 1, as having recovered from the virus. - Dates for the 7th and 8th confirmed cases in Queensland (Diamond Princess cruise ship evacuees) are based on ABC News reports. The 9th confirmed Queensland case, another Diamond Princess evacuee, was first announced in a press release on March 3.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the world's poorest countries would suffer the most if the COVID-19 fallout drove markets to their lowest levels since the 1930s. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" Ms Georgieva said, speaking ahead of next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. She said the IMF would release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that would show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak had turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn.    Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis.  Now the expectation is more than 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this year.    Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at high risk, she said.   ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Ms Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession.  As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries has totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the past two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Ms Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices.   Numbers released on Thursday by the US Government showed 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.  That amounts to about one in 10 American workers — the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since the world's largest economy began keeping records in 1948. And still more job cuts are expected.  The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent, a number not seen since the tail end of the Great Depression. Ms Georgieva said there was no question 2020 would be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF was forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said.  ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.""   She said she and World Bank president David Malpass would pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they could use for critical health needs. She also said the IMF was prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that needed help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board agreed to double the loan levels it would provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide about $US100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

115,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482,"What causes a 'second wave' outbreak of coronavirus, and could we see this in Australia?","Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing. However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection. As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.     Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one. If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away. When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity. If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.   Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection. Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last. The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely. As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.   A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission. If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave. When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.   Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate. Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection. In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound. We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave. However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19. Australia's current efforts are focused on ""flattening the curve"" of the first wave of COVID-19. Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising. But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave. And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward. We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

116,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-lessons-we-can-learn-from-history/12134044,Coronavirus lessons we can learn from other dark times in history,"""One thing I've learned in life is, money can be a very lonely companion. Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.   ""Far from people staying at home, they were being drawn out,"" he said. ""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last? Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said. ""There's a sense that the pandemic has exposed all sorts of gaps in policy ""A whole series of things that people have been advocating for years but got nowhere, are they going to become possible after this?""

117,/news/2020-04-10/darwin-ranger-jailed-for-drug-importation/12137930,Darwin council ranger sentenced in NT Supreme Court for supply of dangerous drugs,"A former Darwin council ranger, who used her job to scope out vacant properties for drug deliveries, has been sentenced in the Northern Territory Supreme Court for the ""careful and methodical"" supply of dangerous drugs.    Kirsten Rose Strickland, 41, worked for the City of Darwin when she organised for more than 100 parcels of drugs ordered on the dark web to be delivered to empty Darwin properties and Australia Post offices. ""The addresses were not randomly chosen by you, rather, you operated in a careful and methodical fashion,"" Justice Peter Barr said in sentencing. ""You identified unoccupied dwellings which were advertised for rent or for sale, to which you could have drugs delivered.  ""You also acquainted yourself with Australia Post mail routes and the timing of postal deliveries."" Between June 2018 and January 2019, Strickland ordered 154 packages of drugs from 41 international vendors and had them delivered to 30 different Darwin properties, addressed to 74 different identities.    The Northern Territory Supreme Court heard police located detailed maps of Darwin city, postal timetables and drug paraphernalia during a search of Strickland's Darwin CBD apartment.  In November 2018, after investigations by a joint taskforce of NT Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police and others, officers followed Strickland as she collected parcels from empty letterboxes around Darwin while driving a council vehicle and wearing her ranger uniform.  An empty package, containing traces of MDMA, was recovered in a bin outside the Darwin Council offices.  ""At the time of your arrest on 16 November 2018, Australian Border Force and NT Police had identified and intercepted 32 consignments of drugs ordered by you addressed to non-existent recipients,"" Justice Barr said. A further seven packages were delivered after Strickland had been taken into custody.  The court heard Strickland had never used drugs until she ""became deeply depressed"" and began using ecstasy in January 2018 at the age of 40.  A mental health report indicated a link between Strickland's mental health issues and drug use, however, Justice Barr rejected any argument that it led to her supply of commercial quantities of drugs.    ""Your depressive illness does not explain your venture into drug importation and commercial supply in what was a well-organised and methodical operation, both logistically and in terms of meticulous record keeping,"" Justice Barr said.  The court heard there was a ""significant element of fraud and dishonesty"" as well as Strickland's drug supply crimes. Strickland profited about $100,000 from the sale of dangerous drugs over six months. ""You somehow convinced yourself at the time of offending that you were not a drug dealer and you were just ensuring high-quality drugs for yourself and your friends,"" said Justice Barr.  ""However, rationalisations and excuses for criminal conduct are common."" Strickland pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying dangerous drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and almost 50 times the commercial threshold of MDMA.  She was sentenced to six years in jail, with a four year and three-month non-parole period. The 41-year-old is no longer an employee of the City of Darwin.",By Melissa Mackay,"April 10, 2020"

But what do you do when those kids are university students who haven't lived at home for months? In a city where rents are expensive, and the interstate university colleges where they used to live are closed, my family finds itself in self-isolation with two university students who are studying online. Suddenly, we are a family of four again. I was delighted to have our beautiful young adults back with us. We were hoping to take advantage of reassimilating and getting to know each other again, doing the quality-time thing.  But it's a different landscape to raising school-age children. For one, the hours are different.   As I write this it's about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I've been up with my husband since before 7am and Uni Student One, who is 20, has just got out of bed.  The younger one is still asleep. We don't expect him to grace us with his presence before 5pm.   Living with uni students is like living with perpetual jetlag except that it is not your own. We aren't operating on the same time zones. Now let me qualify this: they haven't been out disobeying the Government's directions to not socialise in groups of more than two. They haven't had any mates to the house — we are self-isolating after all. They haven't even left the house in over a week.  So far, so legally good. Yet neither of them were in bed until after 5am so they are catching up on their eight hours. Like the possums and bats that frequent the nightscape around where we live, I've discovered my sons are nocturnal: their natural hours of wakefulness barely coincide with mine.  I'm used to a little coming and going during the night (okay sometimes more than a little) but it's an adjustment having them back, and for them too after the freedoms of living away.   It's not just the time zones that are different. The culture shock is real too. While in lockdown, one son has decided to take up a hobby: he's learning guitar.  And while it might be lovely to be strummed to sleep it's far less enjoyable being awoken in the middle of the night to the sound of someone attempting to learn a Jimmy Hendrix riff. (And I stress that's not ""playing"", just ""learning"", which means repeating the same series of chords over and over and over again, and singing the same lyrics on repeat).   Uni Student 2, traditionally the more sporty of the two, has set up a home gym out the back of the house and in the garage using whatever he can cobble together. This means some old weights, some kitchen items, the broom, a back pack with what I think must be dirt inside. Frankly, I don't want to know. I was so looking forward to life with my children again. But instead, life with the uni students means every four bars of Hendrix's Foxy Lady is punctuated with the great thud of a dropped weight on the concrete or a loud grunt of exertion. My sons' body clocks make it impossible for us to time meals together (so much for that quality time).  Hubby and I eat regularly at 7.30pm and the meal we choose at that time is called dinner. Not breakfast.   Dinner for the nocturnal members of the household occurs around 3am and involves microwaving the prepared family meal that they couldn't eat at their ""breakfast"" time. If they are still hungry, I can look forward to a cacophony of banging. It's not weights or music this time, but pots and pans, kitchen drawers, microwave oven doors and fridge doors, over and over again. It finishes not long before my day to begins again, at 6am, with the aftermath from this 3am banquet they didn't quite manage to clean up. So what to do with people who are vibrantly alive in the middle of the night while us parents are trying to sleep in order to be ready to work from home in the morning?  There's plenty of advice for home schooling or entertaining 10-year-olds with online trips to the zoo or recycled craft projects. But what do you do with young people who are a little too old to be sent to bed or the naughty corner? In this household, it's a dilemma that has added a strange new layer to self-isolation. And even though they're young adults it reminds of a time when we used to be awoken to the cries of hunger or the dirty nappy and the argument about who had to get up earlier for work tomorrow and who could do without sleep and get up and change the baby! We'll be thankful they toilet themselves now and feed themselves at whatever time. Because for the first time in a while we're all back together, in the one nest, with time to laugh about who was the loudest baby, who was the most terrible two year old and who made Mum angry. Best of all we get to enjoy those Dad jokes all over again! Who would have thought that there was a silver lining to coronavirus lockdown but it's nice to have time to be ""us four"" again.  So we continue to be patient, as much as we can, for as long as this time lasts.    ",By Mary-Elizabeth Brien,"April 10, 2020"

121,/news/2020-04-10/grandmothers-protest-reject-stereotype-social-activists/12137482,"Pearls out, protests in: This generation of grandmothers is kicking the tired cliches aside","Grandmothers as social activists? What a radical idea … but one that is increasingly true of today's generation of grandmothers.  A sweet memory of my time as president of the Australian Human Rights Commission was being asked by my executive assistant to look down from my Pitt Street office to the Grandmothers for Refugees singing in the street below to support the commission and its advocacy for refugees detained indefinitely in offshore detention camps. What a delight to see the men in their suits walk by in bemused wonderment. How mistaken to dismiss these grandmothers as having passed their use-by date. Why should we be surprised? This generation of grandmothers came from the '60s and '70s, many — and for the first time in history — spending formative years at university with free or minimal fees, marching against Vietnam, experimenting with sexual liberation, burning our bras and ""making love not war"". Political activism is mother's milk to many of the women from those times. Over the following years, this unique generation of women rode the crest of a wave of opportunity and optimism. The Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1984 — problem of equality fixed. The future was ours. And, to a significant degree, so it has been. Today, women over 60 are often well-educated and financially independent, having had a fruitful career while also doing a decent job of raising their children. Today, the '60s generation of women is emerging as a political force to be reckoned with.   But wait. How can it be that the position of women in Australia has been in regression over the past 15 years or so? Here are some disturbing facts. The fastest-growing group of homeless people in Australia is not 18-year-old youths sleeping under a bridge, but women over 55. How ignominious and sad to have to ask your son or niece if you can sleep on their sofa for a few weeks as you can no longer pay the rent or the mortgage. Women retire today on 46 per cent of the superannuation available to men. Why? Because we agree to accept flexible, casual and contract work with little job security or opportunities for promotion. We fall off the superannuation ladder and never catch up, despite providing most unpaid caring work across the nation. Women are still at the bottom of the employment pyramid in female-dominated industries — as hospital paramedics and cleaners, factory workers, maids and waitresses, in hotels and restaurants and in low-paid teaching and nursing positions. The gender pay gap of around 16 per cent is narrowing with glacial speed. In 2006, the World Economic Forum's Gender Index placed Australia 15th globally, broadly among the nations we would most expect to be compared with — New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Scandinavian countries. Ten years later, in 2016, we had slipped to 46th. By 2018, we had gone up a few points to 39th. Our 2020 ranking is 44th. We remain today stubbornly consigned to the lower ranks, below Serbia, Bolivia, Laos, Latvia, Cuba and Burundi.   The WEF Global Index is measured against four indices: economic participation, health and survival, educational attainment and political empowerment. The good news is that, not surprisingly, Australian women and girls are ranked first in the world for educational attainment. But now the bad news: we are a 103rd for health, 77th for ministerial positions in government, 49th for political empowerment and 46th for economic participation. Our hopes for fair access to work were raised by Tony Abbott's promise, as leader of the opposition, of a ""rolled-gold"" six months' maternity leave, only to be dashed when the political debate descended into allegations women were ""double dippers"" and ""welfare cheats"". The law for Australian women remains at 18 weeks' paid maternity leave at minimum wage, compared with Sweden's paternity leave of 480 days at 80 per cent of salary. How has it come to this? Why has education not ensured genuine equality? Why are Australia's women not in the streets demanding fairness from a male-dominated government and corporate sector? Are we, at heart, just like our grandmothers? Has very little really changed? Are grandmothers, by culture or by a law of nature, destined merely to be sweet, passive, caring and kind; to stand behind their men, support the family, love their grandchildren and seek little for themselves?   My grandmother, Sarah-Jane, met all these clichéd standards. She was born in the reign of Queen Victoria, in 1899. She admirably met the traditional image of a grandmother: pretty, even in old age, white-haired and blue-eyed. In 1958, as we stood on the deck of the Iberia, the flagship of the Orient and Pacific Line, leaving from Tilbury Docks for Australia, my mother said, ""Give your grandmother a special wave. She is old and we may not see her again."" Sarah-Jane was 62, dressed in black, wearing pearl earrings and 60-denier lisle stockings, wrinkled at her ankles. Widowed at 53, with few financial resources, she had never been employed. Sarah-Jane was largely dependent on her daughters and sons-in-law.   She came to Melbourne several times to visit us and lived to be 89. Sarah-Jane avoided any sort of disagreement or controversy in private, let alone in the public arena. ""A lady's name should appear in the newspapers only three times in her life: on birth, marriage and death."" She would have been horrified to know that her granddaughter was the subject of 42 satirical cartoons and more than 60,000 words (and counting) of newsprint castigating me for my work as president of the AHRC. For Sarah-Jane, family was all. She believed wholeheartedly in the adage that blood is thicker than water. As one of a typically large Victorian family of eight siblings, she was never particularly interested in widening her small group of friends. I have followed her directions for a successful dinner party. It was bad form, she believed, to engage in one-to-one private conversations; a general conversation among the group on a neutral topic was the desired objective. Sex and religion should never be discussed. In this, I have strayed from her protocol. But I also prefer a wide-ranging debate at dinner. When I was first married to my husband and joined international diplomatic life as a ""trailing spouse"", I remember him accusing me of conducting seminars at official dinner parties! Sarah-Jane might have been surprised to know that she has been a driving motivator in my life. As a teenager in the early '60s, I have a vivid memory of one of her visits. She was sitting up in bed, counting out her small change on the bedspread to see if she could stretch her money to buy a Christmas present for each member of the family. The sum total was pitiful. Sarah-Jane had no means to increase her funds beyond whatever the family's largesse had provided her. Mercifully, my parents were in business as jewellers and were, indeed, generous. At Christmas, we each received a modest gift from Sarah-Jane, and I treasured mine. Yet another seemingly insignificant incident compounded my understanding of my grandmother's loss of autonomy. Like Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Sarah-Jane always wore pearls: three-strand necklaces and earrings. As the earrings were clipped on (pierced ears were vulgar), she was constantly losing one. To go out in public without her pearls was unthinkable. She would ask my father, through the agency of my mother, to buy her new ones. As the saga of the lost earring was oft-repeated, my father became increasingly annoyed, but would eventually relent and provide another. I was struck at the time by the ignominy of Sarah-Jane's position.   Today, if I had lost such an item, I would simply buy a replacement without a second thought. I doubt she was ever able to enjoy that freedom. Such minuscule details of ordinary life mark how things have changed for women today who have financial autonomy. Even as a young girl, I was mortified by the evident frustration of an older woman who had so little financial independence. I vowed never to be in that position. I knew, instinctively, that to reach whatever potential one might have, it was essential, as Virginia Woolf well understood, to have ""a room of one's own"". That is not to say that money has been a catalyst for my work over the decades, but rather that a reliable income is vital to achieving autonomy. Sarah-Jane also had a steely inner core. Arriving home after school one day, I was shocked when she asked me, ""Will you do the ironing or shall I?"" As she'd left the house for work that morning, my mother had apparently airily asked my grandmother to iron the ever-mounting pile of sheets, shirts and napkins, always the last household chore to be tackled. From my mother's point of view, as Sarah-Jane was at home all day, this seemed to be an entirely reasonable request. Not so for Sarah-Jane. The heat of the summer was inescapable and enervating. She was probably about 70 years old. Far better to ask a healthy teenager. I, of course, agreed to do the ironing, but filed away for future reference that my grandmother was smarter than others gave her credit for! As Sarah-Jane sank into the oblivion of Alzheimer's, she lived out her last years in an aged-care residence in London. Whenever I returned to England, I would visit my tranquil, beautifully dressed grandmother, who, having no idea who I was, said to me, ""You're a nice young girl. Do come to see me again."" I would leave in tears, but grateful that Sarah-Jane had at least found some sort of serenity.   Delving into these sepia-tinted flashes from the past, I am surprised by how powerful — even hurtful — they remain. Why would I care today about such fleeting incidents, which one might have imagined would quickly fade? I do not know. But perhaps the psychologists would say that such early experiences shape our adult lives in profound, lasting and unexpected ways. Sarah-Jane would not recognise my 21st-century role as a grandmother. At 74, I am working, travelling and continuing to be outspoken. My grandchildren, Sia (aged four) and Leonard (aged two), live an international life in Paris and are becoming bilingual. I speak to them by Skype and babysit for a couple of weeks in July when the creches and schools are closed for the summer. Every second year, they come to Australia for Christmas. I have some French and would love to speak to my grandchildren in their first language. Rightly, their parents, my son James and his French partner, Marie, insist that I speak only English, otherwise Sia and Leonard will adopt the easy option of French. Sia thinks I am intellectually rather slow. If I mispronounce a word in French or make a grammatical error (quelle horreur), she corrects me and, in exasperation, employs both the English and French words to ensure I get her point. I love being with such bright, energetic children and am sometimes sad that I am a distant, fly-in, fly-out spectre in their lives. My relationship with my grandchildren will be very different from many grandparenting relationships of the past. Different but, I hope, just as special. The geographical distance means that I will not be part of the day-to-day lives of Sia and Leonard. I will not be able to pick them up from school and hear their triumphs and woes. I will always be the visitor who swans into town, breaks the household rules with forbidden treats and goes away again. I will not be there to listen to whispered hopes and fears, nor will I be a gentle, calm and constant presence in their lives. But I will bring to Sia and Leonard that fierce loyalty for family that Sarah-Jane maintained, rightly or wrongly, as well as her warmth and integrity. I hope to be a strong influence in their lives; to stimulate, excite and support them in every way possible. Perhaps I can show them what a woman can achieve in her lifetime, given the opportunity and a dash of determination.   I suspect many women today grapple with finding a new version of the contemporary grandmother, as they retain a traditional view of a caring woman with little autonomy or life beyond her family. Grandmothers today are likely to be healthy, relatively fit and up for a game of tennis or a ski trip (on the moderate slopes). With some significant exceptions (for example, those who have no superannuation, live alone or have high medical expenses), today's grandmother will have financial means of her own, a career and a fruitful, active life. She will nurture her grandchildren, but will be less passive, more actively engaged with the world, freer to rise to her own potential and, I suggest, happier than many grandmothers in the past, with greater self-confidence. While my generation has been uniquely privileged in so many ways, I believe that, as grandmothers, we should use our remaining years and decades to reach out to our less privileged sisters to bring them with us. Too many women have been left behind. The promises of the '60s and '70s have not been met fully for all Australian women. We grandmothers now have a responsibility to advocate, to be politically active in using our education and financial independence to ensure equality of opportunity and outcome. For all women.   How dismaying that I should have studied for a law degree, a Master of Laws and a PhD, all at the expense of the Australian, American and British taxpayers, while law students today will finish their JD degree $100,000 in debt. As grandmothers, we should be demanding affordable childcare, full superannuation even when on maternity and carers leave, equal pay for equal work, freedom from sexual harassment and bullying in employment, and protection from domestic violence at home. As grandmothers, what do we have to lose? We are not looking for advancement in our careers. We are strong, healthy and independent. Bravo to Grandmothers for Refugees, the Older Women's Network and the scores of other women's advocacy and networking groups. Let us work together to harness the power of today's generation of grandmothers, who can and will speak up for social justice. Let us work together to achieve the vision of gender equality that we and our political leaders had in the 60s and 70s. I like to think that, in Sarah-Jane's quiet way, she would have supported my outspokenness on human rights and forgiven me my notorious media presence. I now understand better the continuing influence she has had on my life, and thank her for it. Postscript: I am about to leave for Geneva to take up a new role in the United Nations as Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. For the first time in my grandchildren's lives, I will be only three hours by train from Paris. It seems one should never say never. Maybe in the future I can be a more real presence in their lives than I had believed possible.

122,/news/2020-04-10/for-these-women-religion-is-an-everyday-part-of-work/12032680,"For these women, religion is an everyday part of work — and they wouldn't change it","No matter which aged care organisation Jihan Lazki works in, as a physiotherapist she's doing the same thing. She's being kind to elderly patients, providing them with the best quality of movement she can, and making their interactions pleasant by chatting and caring. But the religious character of her place of work makes a difference to Jihan's experience. She has worked in a Christian aged care setting in the past, but now works at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first aged care home serving Muslim residents. Jihan says the ethos of respect for the elderly and putting residents' needs first is the same as at any other facility. But she tells me there's something particularly comforting about working in a Muslim organisation.   I spoke to Jihan because I wanted to explore how working within your own religious community can impact a person's sense of belonging and purpose. It can be a fraught discussion — hypotheticals swirled around the Federal Government's religious discrimination bill before coronavirus took over. The second draft of this legislation was released late last year, and changes include allowing religious bodies like hospitals and aged care providers to preference employees who belong to the same religion. The bill says this kind of discrimination is aimed at allowing these organisations to maintain their religious ethos. What I wanted to investigate was something different: employees' experience of working in a religious organisation and the impact of combining work and spiritual beliefs. On the other side of the discussion are people who work in a religious setting without sharing those beliefs. The people I spoke to emphasised the ""Christian values"" and ""Muslim philosophy"" inherent in their work — but these are principles that are shared across religious lines, and of course by people who don't subscribe to any faith at all. Jihan grew up in a Lebanese Muslim household, where her parents taught her the importance of giving back to the community. She works as a physiotherapist at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first Muslim-focused aged care facility. Staff members speak Turkish, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu to cater to a culturally diverse Muslim community. Residents ""feel at home when they know that someone can speak their language"", Jihan says. Islamic artwork decorates the home, which has dedicated prayer rooms available for residents and staff and sits next door to the Gallipoli Mosque. Staff members organise residents' treatments around their prayer times, mindful of avoiding a clash and maintaining their Muslim rituals.   Reflecting on her previous workplace, Jihan recalls having to navigate social expectations that didn't match up with her religious practices. Though she was a part of the team and liked social outings to celebrate the end of the week, as a non-drinker she felt she had to ""sit on the side"" when colleagues went to the pub. At Gallipoli Home, she says, ""they work around the religious needs that we have"". ""I can pray next door at the mosque, or I can go and pray in the prayer room, whereas at another workplace, you're scrambling to find the storeroom to pray [only] once or twice a day."" This sensitivity to religious practices means there's no extra pressure on employees like Jihan. ""I can order food straight from our kitchen and I know it's halal, whereas over there, you're looking for somewhere to get some halal food."" Breann Fallon sits on the other end of the spectrum — she works at the Sydney Jewish Museum.   ""If you're going to ask me what I tick on the census, I would tick 'other Christian',"" she says. ""Prior to working at the museum, my connections to the Jewish community were pretty much zilch."" Breann says it was a visit during her school years that prompted her interest in working at the museum. The team's ""strong mission to try and learn from the horrors of the past"" appealed to her. And she says it's their shared goal to ""try and turn it into something that we can learn from and create a better world"".   Rather than being excluded, being part of a religious workplace has given Breann a wider view of tradition and culture. ""I've been so accepted by the Jewish community here. At Easter I would do Pesach [Passover] as well as Easter. I celebrate the Jewish High Holidays as well as Christian traditions,"" she says. ""I also see value in philosophies from other faiths as well. So it's a real mixed bag for me."" Tash Holmes works at Uniting, in a job that links churches in the NSW and ACT presbyteries to the community to facilitate social justice programs. She grew up in the Baptist Church and went to a religious high school, then became involved with Hillsong through worship music.   It's been a rather roundabout route to the Uniting Church and an organisation that she says is ""anchored in compassion, respect, being bold and imaginative"". In fact, when she came out several years ago, Tash didn't see a place for herself socially in any church, let alone making her career in the community. She describes realising and sharing that she was gay while a member of Hillsong as ""coming out into a desert land"", and says she didn't know who she could rely on for support. ""There weren't a lot of accepting churches out there. And faith was still important to me,"" she explains. ""I was still wrestling between faith and sexuality and just trying to find a place where you could even talk to someone about it.""   Though she doesn't belong to the Pentecostal group anymore, it's vital for Tash to be visible as a member of the LBGTIQ+ community in a religious context. ""Uniting was the only Christian organisation that would accept me in the workplace and in their churches,"" she says. She knows there are secular social justice organisations that could offer her the same professional fulfilment, but she's able to also meet her spiritual needs through the work that she does. ""I think the church still has a lot of work to do in this space around LGBTI people of faith,"" she says. ""This is my passion. This is this is the work that I want to see out. And there's no other place to do it.""  ",ABC Radio National      By Alice Moldovan for ABC Religion and Ethics,"April 10, 2020"

124,/news/2020-04-09/how-bernie-sanders-lost-to-joe-biden/12135900,Why Bernie Sanders lost the Democratic presidential primary to Joe Biden,"The year was 1981. The place was Burlington, Vermont. And Bernard Sanders had just been elected the city's mayor by 10 votes, a race so close, and so full of novel ideas, that it drew national attention. ""The problem with the word socialism is that very often it gets equated to what's going on in the Soviet Union — with authoritarianism and totalitarianism and so forth,"" he said in the chanty cadence and shouty tone he'd come to be known for. ""Do I believe the profit motive is fundamental to human nature? The answer is no. I believe the spirit of cooperation is stronger.""   Had you placed those Sanders comments in the year 1991 or 2016 or 2020, no-one would have blamed you. Since that interview, the advent of his 40-year career in politics, Sanders has never once shied away from his ideas, using nearly every moment of his adult existence to fight for principles Americans consider too radical to put into practice. His will of belief was seen as his strongest asset by his supporters. But it may well be the reason he couldn't get the party to rally around him in the end. On Thursday he ended his second (and likely final) campaign for president, opening the door for his moderate rival Joe Biden to win the nomination and take on Donald Trump. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn in economic stagnation, watching America roil with protests and sit-ins, freedom rides and notions of change.   He lived in the thick of it, travelling to civil rights demonstrations and working as a political organiser, finally venturing into politics in his late thirties and successfully transforming a struggling small town into a blossoming city.  His popularity in Vermont landed him 16 years in the US House of Representatives, then three terms as a US senator. Though Sanders filled those offices as an independent, he almost always voted with the Democrats. His decision to run in 2016 was with that party in mind. He felt American progressives weren't hearing his far-left ideas. ""This is not an individual thing, this is not a personal thing,"" he said in a 2013 interview with Politico. ""It would be a disaster for this country to go through a campaign where you had candidates who are not talking about the collapse of the middle class, growing wealth and income inequality, growth in poverty, global warming."" He worried about the consequences of a failed run, but in the end, believed he had a decent shot of beating Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. The establishment either did not, or did, and dreaded it. Coverage of his campaign launch ran on page 21 of the New York Times.   But by the end of that failed run, Sanders had become a household name thanks to a certain strength: voters knew what he stood for. Clinton put it this way in her campaign memoir, What Happened: ""I have a new appreciation for the galvanising power of big, simple ideas."" When Sanders announced he was running again in 2019, the New York Times ran the story on its cover.  The senator raised more than $US18 million [$29 million] through small, individual donations in his first six weeks of campaigning.   That fundraising power would continue to propel Sanders to the top of the historically big and diverse field of candidates. But all the while the moderate wing of the Democratic Party was still sceptical of Sanders' beliefs, and even progressives thought he had obstacles to the nomination. One was the belief that Sanders, age 78, was too old to take on the nomination. Those worries amplified in October when he suffered a heart attack, the kind of health disaster that would end other candidates' campaigns. For Sanders, the medical emergency was shortly followed by a rise in the polls, thanks in part to the strength of his campaign surrogates. The first rally Sanders held after his heart attack was headlined by Democratic darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   He only gained ground from there, earning endorsements from hundreds of celebrities and influencers and becoming the most popular candidate with Democrats under the age of 35. Even with that popularity — or maybe because of it — some worried that Sanders' stubborn commitment to progressive ideals could never do enough to unify the Democratic base. ""Everyone's just talking about electability,"" one Sanders supporter told the ABC ahead of the nation's first democratic nominating contest, the Iowa caucuses. ""I'm putting my money on Biden, and I'll vote for him if he's the one that can beat Trump."" The first two primary contests in Iowa and New Hampshire were messy, but Sanders walked away a winner in both. He defied expectations in the third, Nevada, by securing the normally-moderate Latino vote in overwhelming numbers. Turnout in the state broke records, in part thanks to Sanders' appeal. Everything changed with the fourth state, South Carolina, where 40 per cent of the Democratic electorate is African American. An overwhelming majority of that demographic coalesced around Joe Biden.   The win was so secure it was announced within the first two minutes of votes being counted. It'd be tough to overstate how critical this vote looked to US politics watchers. African American voters are among the most consistently Democratic, and a group historically shown to be harmed by a Republican president.   Though Biden heavily focused on African American voters throughout the campaign, his policies and voting record weren't always as favourable to them as they could be. With Sanders still preaching his big policies, Biden's win in South Carolina revealed that the voters at the core of the Democratic Party still had their minds set on one question: who would beat Trump?  Jason Johnson, former politics editor for the African American-focused publication The Root, put it this way: ""Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States."" The Democratic Party, too, started thinking about what white people would do in the general election.  The day before Super Tuesday, two popular moderate candidates dropped out of the race and threw their support behind Biden in a show of force against Sanders. Sanders' supporters were undaunted. In Los Angeles, more than 20,000 of them packed into an auditorium to hear him speak.   ""I think Biden did a lot of work in South Carolina … but people can't ignore the bloc of Sanders' support,"" one told the ABC then. Uncommitted voters believed differently. As Biden swept 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, exit polls showed that an unusually high number of voters made up their minds 24 hours before voting, and a majority of those late-deciders chose Biden. In the US, concern about coronavirus hit suddenly and decisively around mid-March, pushing politics to the periphery in news bulletins but not necessarily in the minds of Americans. Healthcare was front of mind. So too was the economy. Presidential leadership mattered in a way it hadn't during the Russia probe or Ukraine scandal. With sports and TV shows cancelled, millions of Americans tuned in to the first one-on-one debate featuring Biden and Sanders.   Biden, aided by the lack of a cheering crowd, laid out step-by-step plans for how he'd fight the virus if he were president today.  Sanders stuck to the same policy ideas he always had, talking about redistributing wealth and overhauling the healthcare system. ""It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That does not solve the problem at all,"" Biden responded.  ""People are looking for results, not a revolution."" The next round of primaries again went to Biden. Then the next. Living through a world turned upside down, Americans went the way of South Carolina and decided they could no longer entertain the idea of a political revolution or a sudden shift to socialist policies. They wanted safety, security and predictability. They wanted Joe Biden. Three weeks and thousands of American COVID-19 cases later, Sanders concluded it would be better if he left the race to allow the party to unify around the presumptive nominee. ""Please know that I do not make this decision lightly,"" he told his supporters. ""If I believe we had a feasible path to the nomination I would continue, but it's just not there."" ""But let me say this very emphatically: As you all know, we have never been just a campaign. We are a grassroots, multiracial, multigenerational movement.""   It's the kind of thing that all politicians say when bowing out gracefully, but when Sanders says his campaign was more than a campaign, he really means it. The Republicans in Congress and the President may not have been thinking about Sanders when they passed the first coronavirus bill, but there are echoes of his platform throughout it: government-subsidised healthcare, unemployment insurance, tax cuts to gig workers.   The conservative governments of America's closest allies — Australia and the UK — have enacted similar stimulus packages despite standing opposite Sanders on the ideological spectrum. At a time when the world is at its most dark and desperate, leaders have turned to some of the ideas Sanders has promoted for decades. ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe,"" Sanders said at the beginning of his speech on Thursday. ""Together we have transformed, in the American consciousness, what kind of nation we can become."" He ended his remarks with a single pledge, as if it was ever a question in the minds of Americans — to keep fighting for what he believes in.  ",By Emily Olson in Washington DC,"April 09, 2020"
125,/news/2020-04-08/jobkeeper-bill-passed-questions-answered/12132940,"Now that the JobKeeper Payment has passed Parliament, this is how it'll work","The Government's $130 billion JobKeeper scheme — the largest financial lifeline package in Australia's history — has just been passed with the support of both sides of Parliament. It's expected to be accessed by about 6 million workers. Before we get to some lingering questions about how the scheme is going to work, here's a quick recap of what it's offering: There are a few specific criteria you need to meet, including that you're currently employed or were employed by your work at March 1, 2020. This includes anyone that has been stood down or re-hired since then. You also need to be either a full-time or part-time employee or a casual worker who has been employed regularly with the same employer for more than a year. And finally, you need to be either an Australian citizen, someone with a permanent visa, a Protected Special Category Visa holder, a non-protected Special Category Visa holder who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a Special Category (Subclass 444) Visa holder. It's also worth remembering you can only get the JobKeeper Payment from one employer.   Yes it is.    The Government says the payment is essentially the same as any other kind of income you'd normally pay tax on. It'll be paid to you by your employer not the Government, and so the same tax rules apply. Another thing to note is that you won't be paid superannuation for the payment. But you will be paid superannuation for any other income from your employer that might be supplemented by JobKeeper. On the other hand, if you are receiving the JobSeeker payment (previously known as Newstart) directly from the Government, you won't be taxed. That depends on who you're working for. The Government is urging all businesses who've signed up for the JobKeeper Payment to pay their staff the $1,500 a fortnight now, and claim the money back from the Australian Tax Office in May. But if your employer isn't in a financial position to do that at the moment you might have to wait until the beginning of May when the payments start flowing to businesses.    Not if there's no work for you to do. For some businesses, the restrictions introduced by the Federal Government mean they either can't offer the goods or services they usually would, or only in a limited way, like cafes doing takeaway services. In these cases, employees may not have to work at all or may work reduced or modified hours, but will still receive the JobKeeper Payment. Some businesses are also thinking outside the box when it comes to what they can get their employees to do while their usual job is on hold.   If you're receiving the JobSeeker payment you can't also receive JobKeeper. But the Government is encouraging people not to withdraw any applications for JobSeeker if you've already put yours in. Given you have to report your income for the JobSeeker payment anyway, it says the Tax Office will work out which one you should receive. If you're getting a different kind of Government benefit like the student-only Youth Allowance and have also been stood down from your job, you should be able to receive JobKeeper. But if the $1,500 is more than you'd usually earn in a fortnight, it might impact how much you get from your other allowance.    ",By political reporter Georgia Hitch,"April 08, 2020"
126,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-community-sport-clubs-feeling-impact-of-pandemic/12137910,Community sporting clubs will feel the pinch as coronavirus pandemic hits grassroots levels,"At the historic oval near my inner-suburban home, the customary seasonal transition is in eerie abeyance. The turf wicket would by now usually have been pockmarked by the boots of stampeding footballers and the goal posts erected. Instead, the thin white posts remain in their storage pods near the cricket nets, while the turf square is sprouting autumnal grass, protected by high-tech security (a flimsy rope and two small ""keep off"" signs). Workmen continue to install a new scoreboard that will display the achievements of suburban champs. But no one knows whether its luminous digits will first record goals and behinds, or runs and wickets. The scene is no doubt similar at most country and suburban grounds, the sporting and social hubs of communities that now instead host determinedly sombre socially distanced workouts.   Inevitably the media focus on the impact of the deadly coronavirus pandemic on sport has highlighted the deprivation of AFL and NRL matches and the sundry costs and contingencies.   Most recently we have been confronted by anxious administrators trying to stave off financial ruin by concocting ever more desperate measures to get players back on the field, even if playing on islands or in clusters would risk creating the potentially ruinous air of ""normality"" our political leaders have rightly suppressed.   Amid the huffing of these panic-stricken sporting bureaucrats and the unseemly haggling over the percentages to be cut from vast playing contracts, there has been a consoling thought.   Sport is not imperilled by the financial knock-ons from this deadly pandemic because sport is not merely what we see on the TV or in a packed stadium. Sport at its most basic is a kid with a bat and ball or a racquet or just a pair of runners, regardless of where the evolution of various games through codification, professionalism, mass audience appeal and ""elite performance"" has taken them. But even viewed through the rosiest lens, this does not mean the suburban warriors of community sport are immune from the havoc coronavirus has wrought at the professional levels. When various national governing bodies tightened their stranglehold on the grassroots — in some cases for the greater good — sport became, even more so, a trickle-down economy. So the loss of overall revenue generated through media rights, sponsorship and gate receipts will have a profound impact on how much support will be provided to suburban leagues and clubs. Consequently, the likely sporting depression will provide a test of the priorities and the commitment of administrators to the most important level of sport — the community base that props up the sporting pyramid. Funding for the loss-making women's professional leagues currently driving mass participation will provide a similar insight into their long-term vision.   At local level a flattened economy will have an immediate impact on community clubs that typically rely on sponsorship from the kind of small businesses — such as pubs, restaurants and real estate agents — that have taken the biggest financial hits. The explosion in entry-level and early-age junior participation has also created a steady stream of revenue for many clubs and, in some cases, a heavy reliance on junior memberships to fund overall operations. Will parents hard hit by the depressed economy continue to pay? Will kids return after a gap season in which they have formed an even greater bond with — you might say addiction to —their PlayStations and iPhones? Will senior players who already struggled to come up with their subs — or even be able to pay them — return? Most pertinently, will the governing bodies enjoying a generational benefit from the current participation boom fund their own form of stimulus package to help clubs ensure the now cash-strapped and disadvantaged can still play? Football, particularly, has a bottom-to-top financial model that has imposed sometimes outlandish fees on juniors used to prop up senior teams and even Football Federation Australia itself. This was a controversial topic before the pandemic and could now be — as much as the future of the A-League and W-League — a major source of vulnerability for the sport's continued growth.   Another key funding question for community clubs is whether government grants for infrastructure promised (and in some cases misappropriated) before the pandemic struck can still be delivered given the billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to wage relief and other emergency initiatives. The provision of female change rooms has been a key focus of government grants, given the enormous growth in girl's and women's cricket, football and Australian rules particularly. The best hope might be that grants can still be justified in order to provide stimulus for the building industry. Inevitably even the most prosperous local clubs will find themselves asking similar questions to their professional counterparts: Do they need to pay as much for that half-back or recruit the ex-first grade batsman who might have helped win a premiership?   This might not be such a bad thing for those clubs who have been caught up in the inflated premiership-chasing cash-in-hand economy that distorts the raison d'etre of some even supposedly ""amateur"" clubs. But during the hiatus it is the simple absence of the gathering of weekend tribes that will be felt most, particularly in those country towns where the people you see at the footy on Saturday afternoon might be the only ones you see all week. For now, the new scoreboard near my house merely creates an impatience for the days when its numbers will, like the faces in front of the old grandstand, light up. Offsiders will air a special on the impact of COVID-19 on community sport at 10:00am (AEST) on Sunday on ABC TV.    ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 10, 2020"
127,/news/2020-04-09/netflix-unorthodox-shira-haas-orthodox-judaism-true-story/12133450,Netflix series Unorthodox is bringing the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community into the mainstream,"If you've had a moment to collect your thoughts and breathe after bingeing the truly wild documentary series Tiger King, you might've noticed another Netflix series that has been trending this week that's also based on a true story.   Unorthodox is a four-part German-American miniseries and Netflix's first offering to be told primarily in Yiddish. It might not have big cats and a throuple marriage, but it does take place in a world that at times feels as foreign and unknowable as Joe Exotic's.  Unorthodox tells the story of Esty Shapiro (Israeli actor Shira Haas), a 19-year-old newly married woman who was born and raised in the Satmar Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, New York. But as Esty says, ""Williamsburg is not America"". The people in Esty's community are ultra-Orthodox adherents to the Jewish faith — Yiddish-speakers and descendants of Holocaust survivors who are determined to maintain their culture, community and beliefs and protect themselves from another Holocaust. They have their own schools, medical service and police. There are strict rules and conventions, based on interpretations of the Torah, that govern this community and dictate the way people live their lives — from the way they dress to how they marry.   At the beginning of Unorthodox, Esty flees this community — and her arranged marriage — to Berlin, the home of her estranged mother. There she falls in with a group of classical music students from across the globe, as she begins to explore the secular world and her freedom. But under the orders of their Rabbi, her young husband Yanky (Israeli actor Amit Rahav) is trailing her, desperate to bring her home, with the help of his no-good cousin Moishe (German-Israeli actor Jeff Wilbusch) who has recently returned to the fold. In flashbacks to Esty's life in Brooklyn, we see just how cloistered and difficult her life has been.  There are heartbreaking scenes where we see Esty learn about the existence of her vagina for the first time on the eve of her wedding, visit the mikvah that will render her ready for intercourse, and witness her pain (physical and emotional) as the couple tries to consummate their marriage and conceive a child.   The series is based on Deborah Feldman's 2012 bestselling memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots. Feldman grew up in Williamsburg's Satmar Hasidic community, and by age 17 she was married to a Talmudic scholar.  In The Guardian, Feldman wrote that ""as a woman in the Hasidic community, my singular contribution to society had rested on my ability to marry and have children. My role was special and holy, but it was certainly the only role I could play. Housewife. Mother. For everything else I could depend on my husband"". The flashback scenes in the series are all based on her memoir, including her paltry ""sex education"" and how she had to shave her head and begin wearing a wig once she was married.   Feldman left the community in her early 20s, taking her young child with her. Series creators Anna Winger (creator of German TV dramas Deutschland 83 and Deutschland 86) and Alexa Karolinski (director of German documentary Oma & Bella) worked with many members and ex-members of the Hasidic community in the making of the show. Some have disputed the accuracy of the depictions of the Satmar community, but Dassi Erlich, who grew up in Melbourne's Adass Israel Hasidic community, told Australian Jewish online newspaper Plus61J: ""It's very rare to see the life that I lived depicted on screen so accurately and so well. It's very rare to see it in mainstream media."" Erlich, who is a survivor of sexual abuse from within the Adass Israel community, also described the series as both ""validating"" and ""triggering"".   Where the series departs from Feldman's memoir is in the present-day story that takes place in Berlin. Explaining this decision in Making Unorthodox, Karolinski says: ""Anna [Winger] and I wanted to make a show … in which we could work through a lot of the topics we discuss a lot, especially about being Jewish in Germany."" New York Times television critic James Poniewozik recommended the show, describing it as ""a story of personal discovery with the intensity of a spy thriller"". Jen Chaney in Vulture writes that Unorthodox ""feels right for this moment"" and that ""Esty is undergoing an incremental rebirth after being shut away from the wider world for a very long time. Right now, in particular, it is a gratifying, beautiful thing to witness"".   My two cents: While the Hasidic world is portrayed with a suffocating richness, the secular world of Esty's new friends and new life feels, at times, a little hollow. There is also a heavy-handed approach to the way the series deals with the reverberations of the Holocaust.  In an early scene, one of the music students suggests that the group shows Esty something nice in Berlin, and Israeli music student Yael (Tamar Amit-Joseph) jokingly replies: ""Like what? Hitler's bunker? … Or we can take selfies at the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe?"" But Haas' Esty does redeem these missteps.  Haas is a petite actor who delivers a huge performance — her expressive face swiftly and evocatively darts from hope to betrayal, fear and uncertainty — which holds the series together, and I quickly found myself hooked, invested and rooting for her. And the hunched and cowed way both Haas and Rahav play the newlyweds in the flashbacks, dwarfed by their family and community expectations, is utterly compelling.   Besides Deborah Feldman's book, there are many true stories — including from the ABC and the New York Times — of people who have left Orthodox Jewish communities. At times, Unorthodox feels restrained in comparison to these. For example, the 2017 Netflix documentary One of Us, which is about three people who are trying to leave their Hasidic communities, includes the story of one woman — Etty — a victim of physical and emotional abuse who must choose between her children and her freedom. There's also a masterfully told two-part episode of the podcast Reply All about a Hasidic man using the internet for the first time. In terms of other fictional accounts of life in an Orthodox community, Haas made her name on the two-season Israeli family drama Shtisel (also available on Netflix). In Shtisel, the otherness of the Haredi life is superseded by the universality of their struggles — yes they live a life far from our secular world and far from our reckoning, but actually what Shulem Shtisel (Dov Glickman) is struggling with is something we can all understand: how to love and how to be.

129,/news/2020-04-08/as-wuhan-reopens-some-fear-another-wave-of-coronaviru-infections/12129228,Wuhan is beginning to lift its coronavirus restrictions but some still fear another wave of COVID-19 infections,"It's taken 76 days, but the city where the devastating coronavirus pandemic all started is finally ending its lockdown. Millions of people will be able to leave for the first time since January 22. Zhu Yi travelled to the city with her family for Lunar New Year on January 20, only to be caught in the lockdown three days later. She's excited about the measures lifting. ""Wuhan people are very happy and excited because we have been locked at home for so long,"" she told the ABC. But what's become clear in recent days is this is no free-for-all, and the city is not returning to a normal state. There are still some restrictions in place for locals, as more than 1,000 people with the virus are still being monitored and treated.   China's Government will still be using hyper-vigilant measures to track and trap remaining cases.   Having got through the worst of COVID-19, authorities are not taking any chances in case of another outbreak. ""When we arrived here, no-one had any protection and everyone went out as usual,"" Ms Zhu told the ABC. ""People didn't realise how serious this virus was. I even took part in a family gathering with more than 50 people.""   In recent weeks, as authorities in Wuhan began relaxing restrictions, Ms Zhu and her family have been going outside and shopping at a supermarket — with strict social-distancing measures enforced.   She's deeply relieved that her family was unaffected by the virus. Others weren't so lucky. So far, 2,571 deaths have officially been linked to COVID-19 in the city, although many suspect there were more victims in the early weeks who died without being tested. ""In my wider circle of family and friends, I've heard of about 10 people who have died,"" she said.   While she's booked tickets to leave with her family back to the southern city of Shenzhen on April 12, others can't escape as easily.   People wishing to travel to China's capital require approval from local district governments in Beijing before they can buy a ticket. Nearly all people who leave Wuhan to other cities will face 14 days quarantine upon arrival. And only those with a ""green"" health rating on government apps will be permitted to leave. Those with 'red' or 'orange' ratings representing their level of coronavirus risk face further weeks or possibly months of restrictions. As of Monday, China's National Health Commission reported 574 current cases in Wuhan.   They didn't provide the location of a further 772 people who are currently under medical observation for testing positive to coronavirus without symptoms. It's likely most of them are in Wuhan. ""Since these asymptomatic people also carry the virus, they must be infectious, so we need to be cautious about them,"" infectious diseases specialist Liu Zhengyin told state TV this week. ""As Wuhan gradually lifts its restrictions for many activities, some sporadic cases may occur in the process, but since they appear sporadically, people should not panic.""   With China reducing flights and banning foreigners from entering the country, authorities hope they are catching all infected Chinese who fly into the country with coronavirus. Wuhan is not the only place having strict government measures lifted. In recent weeks, the rest of Hubei province — which was originally locked down with Wuhan — had movement restrictions also relaxed. But brutal clashes on a border bridge with neighbouring Jiangxi province in late March showed just how much difficulty and stigma residents of the province face.     Along with the stigma are the thousands that have been left to pick up the pieces. The relief that many feel about the end of the lockdown is being tempered by the grief thousands of families are experiencing. Last weekend, China designated a day of national mourning for the victims, flying flags at half-mast and pausing for three minutes. It was a departure from the heavily nationalistic coverage of recovered patients and heroic medical staff that state media had been circulating. But even afterwards, the coverage — produced under government orders to spread ""positive energy"" — has mostly concentrated on China's victory over COVID-19.   It's something many have struggled to come to terms with. For Wuhan resident Liu Ning, it's been hard to move on after losing his disabled brother in devastating circumstances. ""I received a call on February 12 from a community worker saying my brother had suddenly died, but they wouldn't say why,"" he said. ""They just told me both his lungs were affected and gave me half an hour to see his body before they took it away to the mortuary house for cremation"". February 12 was the worst day of Wuhan's outbreak, and Mr Liu's compound was under lockdown, meaning he couldn't leave or organise any transport to farewell his brother with such short notice. ""The welfare house said they couldn't send him to hospital because the hospital wouldn't accept him,"" he said.   Thousands of families can tell similar stories of losing loved ones to the virus or facing difficulties accessing hospitals for other critical ailments. Yet as the number added to the daily death toll has continued to dwindle, many have been focussed on celebrating the end of their lockdowns. But the world they face now will not be as it was before. The temporary fences and barbed wire are coming down for some residents' compounds, but staying up for others. Supermarket trips involve long social distancing lines and temperature checks. For this city of 11 million, things won't be going back to normal anytime soon.    ",By China correspondent Bill Birtles,"April 08, 2020"
130,/news/2020-04-09/history-of-the-oxford-english-dictionary/12010628,How the Oxford English Dictionary was brought to life in a rustic 'scriptorium',"Just to work from ""A"" to ""ant"" took the original Oxford English Dictionary team around 10 years. They thought they'd reach ""Z"" in that time — but gathering definitions for hundreds of thousands of words was a mammoth task, especially in the 1870s without the help of technology. ""It is akin to mapping the human genome. It was that big an enterprise,"" says author Pip Williams, who has researched the dictionary's history. And it ended up taking another six decades to complete. There had been a ""go-to"" wordlist, Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, since 1755. But Williams says it included made-up definitions and idiosyncratic spelling, and was ""completely incomplete"".   The Philological Society of London decided they needed a better dictionary — one that documented every single word in the English language — and appealed to the Oxford University Press to fund it. Editor Frederick Furnivall kicked things off, but his work didn't prove fast enough. So a few years in, James Murray, an old school teacher, took over. Murray worked from his Oxford home, in a corrugated iron shed at the back of his garden that had the romantic designation of ""scriptorium"". ""That's where he and his team of lexicographers and assistants went every day to collate and to draft the definitions of every word in the English language,"" Williams says. But they didn't work alone. Murray enlisted the help of thousands of ordinary people. He sent a call-out to the public, in pamphlets distributed far and wide and republished in certain journals, asking people to find quotations from magazines, journals, books or newspapers containing words he and his colleagues were looking for. People from all around the world began mailing tiny little slips, about the size of a postcard, containing references to words the dictionary team sought. ""They'd be stored in pigeonhole shells around the walls of the shed, that were specifically designed to hold the slips,"" Williams explains. ""Those examples — they were the evidence, essentially, of the meaning of the word.""   The team would sort the slips chronologically to determine the history of word, from the oldest example of its use to the most up-to-date. ""The lexicographers' job was to go through these textual examples of words, fashion meanings and show how a word might have changed throughout history. That's what would be put in as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary,"" Williams says. This is where the Oxford differentiates itself from Australia's Macquarie or Collins dictionaries. ""Those dictionaries give us some modern up-to-date meaning of a word, but they don't give us the history of the word,"" Williams says. ""Whereas the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical text, so it gives you the history of the word. It gives you the earliest known use of the word in text, which is really important. ""It takes you from maybe the 1530s all the way up to 2020."" If you were to look up, say, ""pants"" in a modern Oxford dictionary, you'd learn that in the 1800s the word was considered a ""vulgar abbreviation"" of pantaloons.   The rustic scriptorium, with its busy-bee lexicographers and garden surrounds, might sound idyllic, but it contained tension, too. ""There would be these perennial arguments about which words were worthy of being in the dictionary and which weren't,"" Williams says. Murray wanted a dictionary that documented all words, including the colloquial or informal.   But the delegates of Oxford University Press — who were funding the project — were keen for a more efficient approach. ""They were constantly putting pressure on Murray to curtail the number of words that were in the dictionary,"" Williams says. ""They were saying, 'some words are not as important as others'."" Williams researched the original dictionary for her book, The Dictionary of Lost Words. She was curious about what words were left out, given one specific criterion for entry.   ""If a word wasn't written down, it never had a chance of being in the dictionary,"" she explains. ""How many situations, particularly pre-20th century, would there have been where people were using language in a very specific way, in a very specific situation — like the birthing room, or the laundry, or the scullery, or the coal mine? ""And those words, because they're not written down, because the people who use them are illiterate very often, and because there's nobody listening to them or wanting to record their experience, those words are lost to history, because they're lost to the dictionary."" She says this fact reveals a serious fallibility. ""We do not question dictionaries,"" Williams says. ""If you want to solve a Scrabble dispute, you go to the dictionary and no-one will argue about the validity of the dictionary's meaning of the word. ""And all of a sudden I thought, well, hang on a minute. You can argue it, because the original source is biased.""   And not just because it documents only the written word. At the time of the first dictionary, the texts available to lexicographers — technical manuals, professional texts, literature and journalism — were mostly written by men. ""That first dictionary had to be a gendered text,"" Williams says.  ""The original sources were mostly written by men and the people interpreting them were men; the people drafting the definitions were men. ""They had the power to exclude, and had the power to include.""   But women were significantly involved in the compilation of the dictionary, Williams says. ""There were women assistants. There were women volunteers, but we don't know much about them,"" she says. She is frustrated by the lack of recognition for these women — something exemplified by an event in 1928. That year a dinner was held in London's Goldsmith's Hall to celebrate the completion of all sections of the dictionary — so auspicious an occasion the prime minister Stanley Baldwin presided over it.  In attendance were 150 men. Despite some women having worked on the dictionary for as long as 50 years, none scored an invite. However, Williams says three women who had contributed invaluable work to the dictionary — Edith Thompson, Rosfrith Murray and Eleanor Bradley — were allowed to sit in balcony of the hall ""and watch the men eat"". The Oxford dictionary, which recognises that the English language is continually evolving, constantly collects new words and new meanings.  And words are never removed — they form part of the dictionary's picture of history. ""It's fascinating to see the trajectory of a word and [their] life cycles,"" Williams says. ""Climate emergency"" was the 2019 Oxford Word of the Year — ""carbon footprint"" was 2007's — additions that confirm that the dictionary's wordlist is anything but static, and always revelatory.

Five questions answered now the Democratic nominee is decided,"Bernie Sanders, the US Vermont Senator, has ended his campaign to become the next US President. That means Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee and Donald Trump's opponent in the 2020 election. The former vice president beat out 28 other Democratic hopefuls. Here's some really simple answers to your questions about what happens now. Yes. Bernie Sanders was the only other serious contender in the race, and he has now officially dropped out. There are still several primaries and caucuses to run, but without another contender in the race Joe Biden will be a runaway victor in most of them. It's also unclear at this point if they will proceed as Americans deal with the coronavirus outbreak. From here on out, it's Biden V Trump. Get caught up: We've just watched a gruelling season of primaries and caucuses. Here's how America's election system works.   Americans will cast their vote for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump on November 4, AEDT. That's about seven months from now. You won't have to wait that long though to see them face off though.

Mark your calendar: Here's a super simple guide to all the key dates left in the 2020 US election. We don't know yet. A candidate normally chooses their running mate closer to the convention (more on this shortly). But at the latest debate Joe Biden committed to naming a woman as his VP pick.   Mr Biden suggested Stacey Abrams (who ran for governor of Georgia in 2018), former deputy attorney-general Sally Yates and Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen (senators from New Hampshire) were the kinds of people he was looking for, but didn't say which candidates he'd been looking for.   In previous comments, he said he was looking for a VP with experience on the presidential stage, which means his opponents from earlier in the year, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren, could also get the nod. Could it really be a failed primary candidate?: It wouldn't be the first time a former opponent got the running mate job. We profiled every Democrat who entered the race right here. Bernie Sanders will continue his work as a US senator and politician.  He cited congress's work on the country's coronavirus response as one reason that continuing to campaign was unfeasible.   ""This is something I intend to be intensely involved with over the next couple of months and it's something that takes an enormous amount of work,"" he said. Sanders also made clear that he'd continue fighting for the policy plans at the heart of his campaign, including universal healthcare, income equality and a green new deal to fight climate change.  Though he said he fully supports Joe Biden as the nominee, Mr Sanders plans to remain on the ballot in the remaining (delayed) primaries to maintain a level of influence over the Democratic party platform.  ""It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. They're now widely supported,"" he said.  How did Bernie Sanders lose this race? His early lead took a huge hit on Super Tuesday. Here's why the moderates started rallying against him.    The simple answer is we don't know a lot of things, yet. Things are in such a state of flux in the US right now that it's difficult to predict what will happen in a week, let alone several months away.   We know that the Democratic convention has been moved to August 17, just a week before the Republican convention. We don't know how the conventions might have to change if the US is still in the grip of the pandemic. We also know that the election must happen before January 21, 2021. So one way or another, Americans will be heading to the polls to vote for Biden or Trump sometime in the near future. Can Trump cancel the election?: No, his presidential power has limits. If you want to find out how the November poll is likely to change, you can dive in right here. ",By Peter Marsh and Emily Olson,"April 09, 2020"
132,/news/2020-04-09/sydney-fish-markets-coronavirus-easter-demand-seafood/12132668,Sydney Fish Markets open for Easter with coronavirus crowd-control measures allowing a seafood splurge,"Australia's biggest seafood outlet is open for business this Easter under special COVID-19 restrictions.   The Sydney Fish Market, which usually attracts more than 40,000 people over the holiday weekend, has beefed up security and will restrict numbers in its retail outlets.   Chief executive officer Greg Dyer said the market could turn over $10 million in a normal Easter period, but he expected the public's general compliance with stay-at-home advice could halve this. ""We're not entirely sure how many visitors we'll get on the site, but we expect a dramatic reduction and those that do come will see a very different Sydney Fish Market,"" Mr Dyer said. ""A very well organised and highly drilled Sydney Fish Market will make sure we are maintaining all of the requirements under the COVID-19 regulations.""   Good Friday, traditionally the busiest day of the year, will operate with extended trading hours from 5am until 5pm. Parking and pedestrian entry will be restricted on site and police will support enhanced security. The market's five seafood retailers will limit the number of customers allowed inside at any one time and will operate under a one-way traffic system.    De Costi Seafood manager Carmelo Lombardo said online orders had grown by close to 70 per cent during the COVID-19 crisis but he wanted to reassure customers physical-distancing measures would not detract from their Easter market experience. ""Rest assured that when you do buy seafood down the market, you know we have an environment where you can shop at your own leisure but in a safe way,"" Mr Lombardo said.   Prices on Australia's biggest seafood auction floor have surged this week in the lead-up to Easter.   According to Kerry Strangas from the Master Fish Merchants Association, prices collapsed last month after restaurants and the food service industry stopped trading. ""The prices have steadied again, there's not as much product so the fishermen are getting a reasonable price and a fair price,"" Mr Strangas said. ""We want the fishermen to keep fishing and for us to keep trading."" He said if prices collapsed it would be dire. ""Then the industry is gone because you're not going to get out of bed if you don't get what you deserve for your product.""   The improved market has been a godsend for fishers such as Danny Green who operates a trap fishing business out of Coffs Harbour in New South Wales.   ""Probably two weeks ago, up until this last week, fish prices have been crap,"" Mr Green said. ""Now, just before Easter, snapper prices are the highest I've ever seen them. You're looking at $25 to $26 a kilogram.""   At Lake Munmorah in NSW, mesh net and mud crab fisher Allan Reed said some of his catch had been sold for bait two weeks ago because of the reduced demand.    He was also getting less than $8 a kilogram for mud crabs, but this week they earned $57 a kilogram. ""It got so bad I was only working one day a week,"" Mr Reed said.

133,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-jk-rowling-breathing-technique-debunked/12134128,"Does JK Rowling's breathing technique cure the coronavirus? No, it could help spread it","Harry Potter author JK Rowling says a breathing technique has helped her coronavirus-like respiratory symptoms, a claim that has been widely reported and shared on social media. Her tweet includes a video from a UK hospital doctor describing the technique, a type of controlled coughing. This involves taking six deep breaths and on the last one covering your mouth and coughing.   The internet is full of home grown cures for the coronavirus. And when doctors propose them, they appear credible. While special breathing techniques have their place in hospital, under the supervision of a respiratory physiotherapist or respiratory doctor, and for certain medical conditions, using them at home to manage coronavirus symptoms could be dangerous. The technique in the video could help spread the coronavirus to people close by.   By coughing, you could directly infect people with droplets, or these droplets on someone's hands can be transferred to a surface others can touch. So JK Rowling's well-meaning advice could inadvertently help spread the virus to your family, or to the person next to you on the bus.   The cells in our lungs produce a sticky mucus as part of our body's defence system. And when we have a viral lung infection, such as with the virus that causes COVID-19 or the influenza virus, we produce more of it. The mucus traps the invading pathogen. Normally, this mucus is removed from the lungs by the movement of tiny hair-like projections in our airways. From there, we either swallow the mucus or cough it out as phlegm. However, sometime we produce so much mucus it is difficult to breathe. The mucus can block our tiny airways, preventing us from obtaining oxygen from our lungs. In other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, controlled coughing can help remove the mucus and make it easier for people to breathe. This technique may be done as part of chest physiotherapy, along with other lung clearance techniques, in a hospital. The technique is not dangerous, but the contents of what is coughed out can be.   So what's the evidence controlled coughing could help people manage their coronavirus symptoms? Put simply, there are no clinical trials or good evidence. One common COVID-19 symptom is a dry cough. So it's difficult to imagine why controlled coughing would help when you're coughing so much anyway. There is a very real risk that unintentionally this technique would actually spread the virus. When we cough we produce a lot of droplets of mucus from the lungs that are spread as a spray. My research has also shown breathing out forcefully is enough to propel viruses from the lungs this way. Either way large sprays of viruses could infect other people.   In hospital, this risk is minimised by having specialised negative pressure rooms that remove the contaminated air. Patients wear masks to capture the sprays and clinical staff wear personal protective equipment, including masks and face shields. There are also strict infection control measures, such as limits on visitors and hand washing. Yet the risks of transmission remain high. But if you practise controlled coughing at home or on the bus, it's easy to see how you could inadvertently spread the virus. And of course, the technique doesn't kill the virus or cure anyone. So why did JK Rowling endorse this technique? In essence, it's because she believed it helped her, and thought it would help others. However, her tweet says she hadn't been tested for COVID-19, so it's not certain she had the infection. And she may or may not have benefited from the technique. Perhaps her symptoms may have improved by themselves anyway. It's hard to know. My advice is to seek medical advice if you suspect you have the coronavirus rather than rely on testimonials, however well meaning.

134,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-masks-greg-hunt-press-conference/12133106,"Coronavirus testing for healthcare workers to grow, 11 million masks to be sent to healthcare workers","Tens of millions of medical masks have entered Australia in recent days, coronavirus testing for healthcare workers will be expanded, and Australians are being reminded not to neglect their health amid the crisis. Health Minister Greg Hunt, Deputy Chief Health Officer Michael Kidd, and Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Tony Bartone addressed the media in Canberra on Wednesday to announce 11 million masks would be distributed to healthcare workers. But the press conference also touched on the abuse of healthcare workers, the need to conserve face masks and non-coronavirus related health concerns. Here's what we learned: Of the aforementioned 11 million masks set to be distributed to healthcare workers, most will go to hospitals, but the recipients will also include GPs, pharmacies and aged care workers. Mr Hunt said 30 million masks had entered Australia in recent days and the rollout was part of a broader push to secure enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to see Australia through the coronavirus crisis.   ""Now that we have this first importation of 30 million masks, and we have the domestic production looking more certain and stronger, then we're in a position to provide these and there will be additional rounds with continued support,"" he said. ""We have on order, both from our international sources and domestic, over 500 million masks, and I have become increasingly confident about the delivery."" The allocation comes follow doctors raising concerns about a shortage of masks potentially leading to the infection of healthcare workers.   Speaking alongside Mr Hunt, Dr Bartone said the masks were essential for health workers and pleaded with everyday Australians not to use them unless it was necessary.    ""I must remind Australians that the wearing of masks down the street of the CBD is really an inordinate waste of valuable resources,"" he said. ""They're masks that potentially could be used in a healthcare setting."" Health authorities say it is not necessary to wear a mask if you do not feel sick.   Dr Bartone and Professor Kidd also emphasised that people should not neglect their health due to social-distancing and shutdown measures. ""One of the things that we know from the experience of past epidemics and pandemics around the world is that often people do not continue to get the regular health care that they need,"" Professor Kidd said.  ""Sometimes we see more morbidity and mortality occurring from preventable chronic conditions than actually occur from the infectious agent itself.""   Dr Bartone agreed, saying some pathology providers had experienced a drop in demand, indicating people were putting off getting medical tests. ""If Australians neglect their care during this time, all we are going to do is shift an enormous burden of care many, many months down the road with worse outcomes, more complications, more morbidity, and indeed, many Australians will lose their life to preventable conditions.""   Mr Hunt said he was concerned by reports of people abusing healthcare staff, including by coughing on doctors and nurses while claiming to be infected. Mr Hunt said he had received advice that, in extreme circumstances, infecting another person could result in imprisonment for life. ""The most serious of these offences may carry maximum penalties up to imprisonment for life if somebody were to take a step which led to the death of a healthcare worker, if that were a deliberate transmission,"" he said.

135,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-travel-cancellations-gym-membership-refunds/12132710,"Coronavirus has led to a rash of consumer complaints, from holidays to health insurance. Here's what refunds you can expect","What can you do if your flight or package holiday is cancelled? Are you eligible for a refund? With coronavirus making travel impossible, people have been trying to get their money back or arrange different travel dates. There's good news if you're one of them. In most cases you should be able to get a credit or a refund, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is taking a keen interest in the sector. But it's not just travel where people are finding they are paying for things they cannot use. The ACCC has also looked into what's happening with gyms, supermarkets and health insurance.     In most circumstances, if travel has been cancelled, the ACCC expects companies to offer a refund, credit note or voucher.  If travel has been cancelled due to government restrictions, that impacts guarantees under Australian consumer law, but people could still be entitled to refunds under the terms and conditions of their ticket. Any credit note or voucher issued should have an expiration date long enough to ensure it can be used. Some travel insurance policies may also compensate people.   ACCC Chair Rod Simms said one travel service provider had been charging ""change fees"" for changing bookings of cancelled flights. But after being contacted by the ACCC, it stopped and will also offer fee-free travel credit. Some people have also been affected by businesses that the ACCC alleges had altered the terms and conditions of the holiday deals they were selling. When claims for refunds or credit vouchers were made by customers, the business was using the new terms to make assessments, not those under which the booking was made.   Businesses are not permitted to change terms after sales in order to deny refunds. If a business does not honour the cancellation policies in place at the time of sale, it could be considered misleading conduct under consumer law. But if a customer decides to no longer go on a trip due to fears around coronavirus, this could be considered a ""change of mind"", meaning getting refunds could be more difficult. ""Given the exceptional circumstances, the ACCC encourages all businesses to treat consumers fairly and compassionately,"" Mr Sims said.  ""We welcome the decisions by many businesses who are already offering refunds to all ticketholders, and expect other event and travel businesses to also offer remedies to all affected consumers when events or travel services are cancelled.""     A major gym chain had been charging a weekly ""freeze fee"" for the duration of their closure. That's OK if such a fee is part of the terms and conditions of the gym membership. However, the ACCC said it expects gyms to not charge membership ""freeze"" or ""holding"" fees ""given many memberships are being paused due to the government restrictions preventing gyms from operating, rather than customers requesting a pause"". Anyone charged by their gym since it has been closed should contact it to have their money refunded. ""The Australian Consumer Law prohibits businesses from taking payments for goods or services when there are reasonable grounds to believe the services won't be supplied,"" the ACCC said. ""This applies whether or not your contract allows you to suspend payments. So you do not have to continue to make regular payments while services have ceased.""   Some customers have complained they can't access all the services they pay for under their health insurance policy. But the corporate watchdog says this isn't on. ""The ACCC recommends that private health insurers provide remedies for consumers for services that can no longer be provided or only provided to a limited extent due to COVID-19 restrictions, such as dental, optical, physio,"" it says.     With the increased demand on supermarkets, there have been concerns about potential price gouging of fresh produce like fruit, vegetables and meat. However, the ACCC said the price rises were not COVID-19 related and had been expected before the pandemic led to many shelves across the country being stripped bare by panic-buying. ""Higher fresh produce prices had been predicted as early as January due to the drought and the bushfires, which have contributed to a supply shortage and led to higher prices for some items,"" the watchdog said.

136,/news/2020-04-08/women-in-agriculture-show-girls-make-great-farmers/12130138,Father stunned by response after asking for help convincing his daughter that girls are farmers too,"A father of three girls on a farm in Western Australia's wheat belt has been inundated with uplifting messages about women in agriculture. Ty Fulwood was unpacking a travel bag with his oldest daughter, three-year-old Sylvie, when she made a surprising comment. She had playfully asked him if he would share his work clothes.   He took it as a sign she was thinking about a future working on the farm. ""Are you going to help Daddy when you get older and be a farmer?"" he asked. Her response stunned him. ""No daddy, I'm not going to be a farmer,"" she insisted. ""I'm a girl not a boy."" He realised that despite creating a supportive environment for his daughters, they didn't see many females working on the farm and that had created a perception in their young minds that women don't work in agriculture. ""For her at three-and-a-half to think that it wasn't an option because she was a girl just really stumped me,"" Mr Fulwood said. Mr Fulwood, who runs a cropping operation growing wheat and canola in Cunderdin, 150 kilometres east of Perth, wanted to show his daughters examples of female farmers. But because of coronavirus restrictions couldn't do it in person. So he took to Twitter. Hundreds of people have responded with videos and photos of life on the land.   ""I thought I might get a couple of responses but it was quite a large response,"" he said. Some people shared videos, directed to Sylvie, explaining why they had a passion for agriculture.   Others shared images of themselves or their daughters and wives getting busy on the farm, helping with lambing, feeding livestock or working with heavy machinery. Western Australian wool producer Emily Stretch shared a video of feeding time. ""I filled the feeder using the auger and reversed the trailer no worries,"" Ms Stretch said. ""Girls can do anything they put their mind to, so can guys!"" In northern Queensland, Kate Andison and her four sisters all consider themselves farmers. ""Our parents are farmers and we all work together at home on our family cattle property,"" Ms Andison said. ""They are very proud and happy that girls can be farmers and work in our family's business. You can do what ever you want to and remember that girls make the best farmers.""   UK farmer Eleanor Durdy said farming wasn't just a man's world. ""They have a female farmer emoji, so it must be true!"" said Ms Durdy, highlighting the importance of making women in agriculture more visible. Mr Fulwood said his next challenge was to keep his young daughter's attention while showing her the many videos and stories sent her way.   He added that he would keep the Twitter thread for future use when his daughters are a bit older. ""There were so many positive responses and from what I saw there were so many responses from men and women,"" Mr Fulwood said. ""I think it's an issue that affects all of us and we are all trying to manage.""   He said agriculture was slow to change partly because inter-generational farms don't change hands very often. ""I only came back to the farm at 30 after a life in the city and a few things hit home with me about gender roles and attitudes to change,"" he said. ""I find it very good to see men and women sharing and commenting and contributing to the conversation.""",Landline      By                                 Margot Kelly,"April 08, 2020"
137,/news/2020-04-08/asia-pacific-students-migrant-workers-travel-stuck-coronavirus/12105458,Migrant workers and international students stuck in Australia due to coronavirus travel bans,"Asty Rastiya hasn't seen her children in almost three months.    The Indonesian mother of two, who came to Australia to study a PhD in journalism at Deakin University, spent that time renting a house and finding furniture: she wanted the home to be ""perfect"" for when her husband and two kids jumped on a plane from Indonesia to join her. But the coronavirus pandemic — and the global border closures surrounding it — has thrown Ms Rastiya's plans into disarray. Just like the hundreds of Australians trapped overseas due to nationwide lockdowns and grounded flights, migrant workers and international students have found themselves stuck in Australia, cut off from loved ones and facing economic uncertainty.   In Ms Rastiya's case, her husband and children were supposed to fly to Australia on March 22, but the Australian Government's travel ban for non-citizens and temporary residents, announced just three days before their planned departure, meant they wouldn't be allowed in.   ""My husband had resigned from his job. My family was ready to fly to Australia,"" she told the ABC. She said they scrambled to find another flight, but the ones they found were either too short-notice or too expensive. Getting home isn't a simple financial decision, either. Rastiya signed a 12-month rental lease (her agent and landlord have since offered some rental relief), and receives an allowance through the Department of Foreign Affair's (DFAT) Australia Awards Scholarship while studying in Australia. ""I wouldn't get my allowance if I decided to go home and would create another problem instead,"" she said. ""When I look at the people around me who lost their jobs, it made me feel guilty to just think about my feelings, so it's better for me to stay.""   She's also fearful of contracting the virus while travelling and then spreading it in Indonesia, which has more than 2,200 cases and almost 200 deaths. ""I wouldn't know whether the people who I meet in the airport have been infected, [whether] the things I'd touch [are contaminated with the virus] and I might carry the virus home,"" she said. She's also terrified for her family in the world's fourth most populous nation, where cases were slow to be detected and which, one study suggests, could have 250,000 infections by the end of the month unless strict physical distancing measures are taken. ""I'm very, very, very worried about them. I keep thinking about my parents as they are very vulnerable,"" she said. ""I can't do anything. I can only check on them by phone, through video call and keep reminding them to not leave the house.""   ""I'm so thankful to have a supportive husband, I had always underestimated him when it comes to taking care of our children,"" she added, holding back tears. ""He has sacrificed many things to send me [to Australia], and I just feel I would be too selfish if I decide to go home."" Neang Saran, 24, spent some of her childhood in a Cambodian orphanage. When she found out she'd be coming to Australia for a year to study a diploma in business, she couldn't wipe the smile off her face.   ""It was unbelievable. It was like a dream come true, because I was always thinking about coming — like applying for scholarships to study in Australia, get new experience in working life and experience in a new country. That was my dream,"" she said. She arrived in Australia a month ago and undertook preliminary English classes. But just one week in, the school was shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. Going back to Cambodia would be difficult — the country has closed its land borders to stem the spread of COVID-19.  There are no direct flights between Cambodia and Australia and some transit hubs, like Thailand, have banned entry to foreigners.   Ms Neang's scholarship had included accommodation, but as it is now on hold, she is stuck in Melbourne without any means of supporting herself. For now, she's relying on the kindness of some acquaintances for a place to stay and food.   ""I feel like I'm lucky that I know people here who have a beautiful heart and are kind to me, but if I hadn't known them I would be homeless,"" she said. She's worried about her family and friends back in Cambodia. The country has just over 100 cases, but a more severe outbreak could overwhelm its already under-resourced healthcare system.   ""The health system in Cambodia is not as good as here … and also I am worried about my family financially,"" Ms Neang told the ABC. Before arriving in Australia, she was working in Phnom Penh as a digital marketing and communications officer and was using about half of her wage to support her family.  Her mother is financially dependent on her, and her brother is trying to put himself through university in Cambodia. She had planned to work part-time while studying so she could support herself and also send money back to her family. But job opportunities quickly dried up, with businesses closing as the coronavirus spread.   Her plans for entrepreneurship in 2020 have stalled, but Ms Neang still counts herself lucky that she can talk with her family on video calls ""to see them every day and bring back my smile"". ""Things changed and I don't know what to do … It's not only me but everyone that is having trouble,"" she said. ""But I'm OK. I'm trying to think in a positive way so I can feel better and not be upset."" Lizzie Meng is an Australian citizen, but for the past decade, China has been her home.   She and her three children have been living in China since 2010, but when the COVID-19 epidemic was first declared there earlier this year, she flew to New Zealand. As new COVID-19 cases dwindled in China and began to skyrocket in other parts of the world, Ms Meng decided it was time to take her children home, via Australia. But the family of four were stopped by the Australian Border Force while transferring at Sydney Airport, one hour after the ban on all Australian citizens and permanent residents travelling overseas came into force at midday on March 25.   Ms Meng said she wasn't aware of the travel restrictions before she arrived in Sydney.   ""I immediately crashed and cried when I heard about [the travel restriction],"" Ms Meng said. She didn't have any friends or relatives in Sydney, so decided to fly to Melbourne, where they are currently undertaking 14 days of self-isolation.  ""I was so touched for our friends treating us like we were their families,"" she said. Ms Meng said she still wanted to go home, despite the risks of contracting COVID-19 during long-haul flights and airport layovers.  ""The global pandemic might not be finished until Christmas. Don't I need to go back to where I live in China?"" she said, adding the children also needed to go to school. ""I have to go with the risks."" The Department of Home Affairs was approached for comment and directed the ABC to recent announcements about allowing migrants on the Pacific Workers Scheme to extend their visas by 12 months. Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said there has always been an expectation that temporary visa holders and first-year international students are able to support themselves. However during the crisis international students who have been in Australia longer than 12 months will be able to access their superannuation. ""For those people who are foreign nationals here on a temporary basis … if you cannot support yourself in Australia, then please consider departing the country, going home where you can get that support,"" he said in a press conference on Saturday.
