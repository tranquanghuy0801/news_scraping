0,/news/2020-04-09/netflix-unorthodox-shira-haas-orthodox-judaism-true-story/12133450,Netflix series Unorthodox is bringing the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community into the mainstream,"If you've had a moment to collect your thoughts and breathe after bingeing the truly wild documentary series Tiger King, you might've noticed another Netflix series that has been trending this week that's also based on a true story.   Unorthodox is a four-part German-American miniseries and Netflix's first offering to be told primarily in Yiddish. It might not have big cats and a throuple marriage, but it does take place in a world that at times feels as foreign and unknowable as Joe Exotic's.  Unorthodox tells the story of Esty Shapiro (Israeli actor Shira Haas), a 19-year-old newly married woman who was born and raised in the Satmar Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, New York. But as Esty says, ""Williamsburg is not America"". The people in Esty's community are ultra-Orthodox adherents to the Jewish faith — Yiddish-speakers and descendants of Holocaust survivors who are determined to maintain their culture, community and beliefs and protect themselves from another Holocaust. They have their own schools, medical service and police. There are strict rules and conventions, based on interpretations of the Torah, that govern this community and dictate the way people live their lives — from the way they dress to how they marry.   At the beginning of Unorthodox, Esty flees this community — and her arranged marriage — to Berlin, the home of her estranged mother. There she falls in with a group of classical music students from across the globe, as she begins to explore the secular world and her freedom. But under the orders of their Rabbi, her young husband Yanky (Israeli actor Amit Rahav) is trailing her, desperate to bring her home, with the help of his no-good cousin Moishe (German-Israeli actor Jeff Wilbusch) who has recently returned to the fold. In flashbacks to Esty's life in Brooklyn, we see just how cloistered and difficult her life has been.  There are heartbreaking scenes where we see Esty learn about the existence of her vagina for the first time on the eve of her wedding, visit the mikvah that will render her ready for intercourse, and witness her pain (physical and emotional) as the couple tries to consummate their marriage and conceive a child.   The series is based on Deborah Feldman's 2012 bestselling memoir Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots. Feldman grew up in Williamsburg's Satmar Hasidic community, and by age 17 she was married to a Talmudic scholar.  In The Guardian, Feldman wrote that ""as a woman in the Hasidic community, my singular contribution to society had rested on my ability to marry and have children. My role was special and holy, but it was certainly the only role I could play. Housewife. Mother. For everything else I could depend on my husband"". The flashback scenes in the series are all based on her memoir, including her paltry ""sex education"" and how she had to shave her head and begin wearing a wig once she was married.   Feldman left the community in her early 20s, taking her young child with her. Series creators Anna Winger (creator of German TV dramas Deutschland 83 and Deutschland 86) and Alexa Karolinski (director of German documentary Oma & Bella) worked with many members and ex-members of the Hasidic community in the making of the show. Some have disputed the accuracy of the depictions of the Satmar community, but Dassi Erlich, who grew up in Melbourne's Adass Israel Hasidic community, told Australian Jewish online newspaper Plus61J: ""It's very rare to see the life that I lived depicted on screen so accurately and so well. It's very rare to see it in mainstream media."" Erlich, who is a survivor of sexual abuse from within the Adass Israel community, also described the series as both ""validating"" and ""triggering"".   Where the series departs from Feldman's memoir is in the present-day story that takes place in Berlin. Explaining this decision in Making Unorthodox, Karolinski says: ""Anna [Winger] and I wanted to make a show … in which we could work through a lot of the topics we discuss a lot, especially about being Jewish in Germany."" New York Times television critic James Poniewozik recommended the show, describing it as ""a story of personal discovery with the intensity of a spy thriller"". Jen Chaney in Vulture writes that Unorthodox ""feels right for this moment"" and that ""Esty is undergoing an incremental rebirth after being shut away from the wider world for a very long time. Right now, in particular, it is a gratifying, beautiful thing to witness"".   My two cents: While the Hasidic world is portrayed with a suffocating richness, the secular world of Esty's new friends and new life feels, at times, a little hollow. There is also a heavy-handed approach to the way the series deals with the reverberations of the Holocaust.  In an early scene, one of the music students suggests that the group shows Esty something nice in Berlin, and Israeli music student Yael (Tamar Amit-Joseph) jokingly replies: ""Like what? Hitler's bunker? … Or we can take selfies at the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe?"" But Haas' Esty does redeem these missteps.  Haas is a petite actor who delivers a huge performance — her expressive face swiftly and evocatively darts from hope to betrayal, fear and uncertainty — which holds the series together, and I quickly found myself hooked, invested and rooting for her. And the hunched and cowed way both Haas and Rahav play the newlyweds in the flashbacks, dwarfed by their family and community expectations, is utterly compelling.   Besides Deborah Feldman's book, there are many true stories — including from the ABC and the New York Times — of people who have left Orthodox Jewish communities. At times, Unorthodox feels restrained in comparison to these. For example, the 2017 Netflix documentary One of Us, which is about three people who are trying to leave their Hasidic communities, includes the story of one woman — Etty — a victim of physical and emotional abuse who must choose between her children and her freedom. There's also a masterfully told two-part episode of the podcast Reply All about a Hasidic man using the internet for the first time. In terms of other fictional accounts of life in an Orthodox community, Haas made her name on the two-season Israeli family drama Shtisel (also available on Netflix). In Shtisel, the otherness of the Haredi life is superseded by the universality of their struggles — yes they live a life far from our secular world and far from our reckoning, but actually what Shulem Shtisel (Dov Glickman) is struggling with is something we can all understand: how to love and how to be.

1,/news/2020-04-09/restless-dance-theatre-loses-australia-council-funding/12133156,Australia Council funding cut to Adelaide troupe leaves dancers with disabilities in limbo,"Internationally renowned choreographer Michelle Ryan is using her time in self-isolation during the coronavirus pandemic to save her dance company.   The Australia Council has announced the winners and losers of its latest four-year funding process, with Restless Dance Theatre joining the likes of La Mama Theatre in Melbourne and The Blue Room Theatre in Western Australia in having its main source of revenue axed. The company, which provides paid work for dancers with disabilities, currently receives more than $300,000 per year as part of a four-year funding arrangement, and had applied to the Australia Council to increase that figure. Instead, its funding was cut entirely — a move that has left Ryan devastated. ""I was absolutely shocked,"" she said. ""I thought that our application was very strong and we have such a point of difference to everyone.""   Arts Industry Council of SA chairwoman Gail Kovatseff was critical of the decision to take funding away from an employer of artists with disabilities. ""I was profoundly shocked, and the reason why I was profoundly shocked was that they are not just a nationally regarded company, but an internationally regarded company, working in diversity,"" she said. ""Diversity is a strong criteria for the Australia Council."" She said while Australia Council funding to South Australia had ""been in decline for some time"", the loss would not only be felt this year but would have a ""cumulative impact"". Ms Kovatseff said smaller companies like Restless Dance Theatre were already disadvantaged because they did not have the staff to target alternative financial sources, such as philanthropy. A spokeswoman for the Australia Council acknowledged that Restless Dance Theatre was highly regarded within the national dance sector, a fact that had been recognised by those who assessed its funding application. However, she also said competition for the four-year funding was fierce and demand had continued to exceed the budget capacity.   Some within the dance sector are bitter that Restless Dance Theatre lost its funding while others including the Australian Dance Theatre had their funding renewed. A spokesman for the Australian Dance Theatre did not want to compare the two funding bids. However, he said the company would be supporting Restless Dance Theatre and the two troupes were in ongoing communications about how that would work. The news of the funding cut came less than two weeks after Ryan was named as the winner of the 2020 Australia Council Award for Dance. Battling multiple sclerosis, which ended her dance career, Ms Ryan has been locked in self-isolation for three weeks.   She is spending much of her time on her mobile phone and computer trying to save the company. ""I moved to Adelaide for this job and really work has been my life,"" she said. ""I've had two Zooms [online meetings] today and I ended up in tears, but I'm also quite a strong person when I get a fire in the belly. ""I just really believe in the work that we do and we need to find a way."" Almost 150 arts organisations across Australia will get money from the annual allocation of nearly $32 million. Nine of those organisations are from South Australia, a drop from 11 in the current funding period. To soften the blow, the Australia Council will provide ""transitional"" funding for one year to companies which missed out. For Restless Dance Theatre, that equates to about $217,000 — a figure which would lead to job cuts, as well as less paid work for dancers. Beyond that, Ryan fears for the future of the company that had been set to tour internationally again, before travel was restricted to halt the spread of coronavirus.",By Matthew Smith,"April 09, 2020"
2,/news/2020-04-08/virtual-tour-art-cinema-theatre-dance-exhibition-gallery-comedy/12115510,"As Australian arts moves online, here is where to check out comedy, theatre, music, drag, visual art and more","In the parallel universe where coronavirus didn't happen, thousands of us are taking our seats at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival right now. Thousands more are immersing ourselves in epic installations at the Biennale of Sydney or experiencing a sensory overload at QAGOMA's Water exhibition in Brisbane. Instead, these venues and festivals — alongside hundreds more, nationwide — have shut up shop, many for the first time in their operational history. As for us, we're cooped up like barnyard hens, socially distanced and self-isolated from one another.    Still, the arts haven't gone anywhere. In fact, we rely on them perhaps more than ever. Streaming TV and movies, video games, books and music all keep us sane and entertained, providing reprieve from the rolling horror of the news.  The only thing missing is the ability to experience all this together, alongside each other. However, Australian arts companies and organisations are stepping up, offering alternatives that make them accessible from home — or at least offering suggestions on how to help ensure their survival on the other side of COVID-19. Here are some of them.  This year's Biennale of Sydney — titled Nirin (meaning 'edge' in Wiradjuri) — is migrating online as of this week. In coming weeks, they say they'll be offering virtual walk-throughs and 360-degree tours via the Google Arts & Culture platform. In the meantime: head to their Instagram to catch up on curator-led tours through the different Biennale venues; and keep an eye on their YouTube for new content (which currently includes a look at Tony Albert's outdoor 'greenhouse' on Cockatoo Island).   The National Gallery of Victoria has launched immersive virtual tours of its exhibitions: you can currently 'walk' through the their blockbuster (and normally ticketed) exhibitions Keith Haring | Jean Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines (and listen to the audio guide at the same time) and Kaws: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness. Bendigo Art Gallery have created an online version of their exhibition Bessie Davidson and Sally Smart: Two artists and the Parisian avant-garde. The exhibition, which was open for just one day before the gallery had to close, features more than 50 paintings by lesser-known Australian Impressionist Bessie Davidson, who found success in 19th-century Paris, alongside works by her great-niece: renowned Australian artist Sally Smart.   Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA) are using their YouTube channel to showcase conversations with artists, in-depth looks into collections and hypnotic time-lapses of large-scale installations being built.  Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) might be closed, but Tim — a former tattoo-parlour manager turned living sculpture — is live-streaming his endurance performance in the empty gallery from 10:00am-4.30pm daily. Many art gallery stores are also still open online. Support your favourite gallery by buying gifts for others and yourself. For what it's worth, MONA is doing its bit by continuing to sell its infamous yet beloved vulva-shaped soap online — finally bring together art and hygiene.   Most cinemas are offering customers full refunds on any unused tickets. In the meantime, purchasing gift cards and cinema memberships for future use will help ensure they can be operational in a post-coronavirus world. While we're temporarily deprived of new releases on the big screen, Australia is lucky to have more streaming services available than ever. Netflix, Stan, Foxtel, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Disney Plus — as well as specialist services like DocPlay (documentaries), Hayu (reality TV) and Kayo (sports) — all require subscriptions.    On the other hand, ABC iView, SBS On Demand and commercial TV catch-up services cost nothing. And anyone with an Australian library account has access to Beamafilm and Kanopy, which offer a range of top-quality recent release movies and TV shows. Recent releases on Kanopy right now include Carol, Room, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and I Am Not Your Negro.  (Though public libraries are closed, here are ways to get the most out of your membership.) For Australian musicians working in an industry already gutted by illegal pirating and paltry shares offered by streaming services, playing live shows was often the last reliable source of income. For performers, tour managers, venue operators and crew alike, the closure of venues has now obliterated that revenue stream too. The industry's response? Isol-Aid music festival, which sees Australian musicians play music from home studios and bedrooms each weekend on Instagram. The sets raise money and awareness for Support Act — a charity supporting music workers impacted by Covid-19 (and was already supporting music workers affected by bushfires).   Find out which artists are scheduled via their Instagram account, hop onto the artist's Instagram at the scheduled time, and tune into the likes of Sarah Blasko, Courtney Barnett, Campcope and Montaigne playing intimate sets. And then, of course, donate to Support Act.  A special ""lunchtime"" edition of the festival — Isol-Aid: Lunch Without Borders — will be streaming from their Instagram this Wednesday from 11:30am to 1:30pm — featuring 15-minute sets from five artists, including Gordi, Asgeir, Julien Baker and Of Monsters And Men's Nanna Bryndis Hilmarsdottir. (Also consider paying for downloads of songs and albums instead of relying on Spotify and Apple Music. Direct downloads from Bandcamp allows artists to retain money. One recent fundraiser on the platform saw over $7 million AUD worth of music and merch sold, with profits retained by musicians. Better yet: order vinyl if available and support local record stores in the process.) With 640 shows scheduled, MICF 2020 was set to break records over its scheduled three-and-a-half week festival. Instead, it's making history for more sombre reasons. MICF's cancellation has also meant hundreds of other comedy shows across Australia have also been cancelled.   This Sunday (April 12), the ABC brings the festival into homes with a special Comedy Care Package at 8:20pm. Hosted by Denise Scott, the special will showcase the best of past MICF Galas, featuring festival favourites Aaron Chen, Anne Edmonds, Becky Lucas, Cal Wilson, Dave Hughes, Frank Woodley, Kitty Flanagan, Nazeem Hussain, Steph Tisdell, Tom Gleeson and Urzila Carlson. If you're not following your favourite comedians on social media already, now's a great time to discover what podcasts or video content they're producing. Judith Lucy's Overwhelmed and Dying (aren't we all?) podcast couldn't be more relevant or timely.  ABC Comedy has a dedicated TV station (Channel 22) and iView channel. Stan, Netflix and Amazon Prime have their own existing or upcoming Australian comedy specials to mine, including Zoë Coombs Marr's acclaimed stand-up show Bossy Bottom (available on Amazon Prime from April 10).  Punters can also make tax deductible donations to MICF to ensure the festival's survival. Ticket holders can also donate the value of their purchased tickets to the artist they were going to see, or email box office to arrange for a percentage of the sale to be retained. Follow MICF's Twitter and Facebook accounts to see daily mini-sets from previous festivals. Melbourne drag queen Victoria Bitter wrote this compilation of ways Australia's drag community has activated remotely and online during Covid-19 venue closures.  Renowned drag performance artist Betty Grumble offers free daily 10:00am workouts via Instagram Live.  Queer Space — who've had to cancel events that focus on regional cities — are seeking immediate financial aid for their artists through their #BuyATicket campaign. They are also hosting Queer Space Virtual Trivia live on their Facebook page on Tuesdays at 8:00pm.  As Eamon Flack and Sue Donnelly of Sydney's Belvoir St Theatre put it, now is ""a time diabolically unsuited to theatre"". Many Australian theatre companies are asking audiences to consider donating unused tickets as a tax-deductible refund.  Australian National Theatre Live — which specialises in filming Australian theatre productions for cinema release — will host the Virus Free Theatre Festival. This week it's showing The Dapto Chaser by Australian playwright Mary Rachel Brown — filmed at Sydney's SBW Stables Theatre in July 2015 — on Friday April 10 and Saturday April 11 at 8:00pm, via its Facebook page.    While Sydney Dance Company is unable to perform for audiences, it earns substantial revenue through its dance classes. Unlimited dance classes are available for $28 a week through their virtual studio. Smaller dance companies and studios also offer similar classes. Meanwhile The Australian Ballet has newly launched Ballet TV, broadcasting some of its most beloved ballets free of charge with cinema-quality recordings of full-length performances, starting with David McAllister's completely OTT production of The Sleeping Beauty.  Missed out on seeing Opera Australia's Attila? Two performances were staged before social distancing was introduced and ABC Classic recorded the second performance, which is available to stream for free. Sydney Chamber Opera was able to film their new production of Breaking Glass (in front of an audience-free theatre): four new one-act mini-operas composed by emerging female composers Peggy Polias, Josephine Macken, Georgia Scott and Bree van Reyk — all of which will be streamed soon. Having had to stop its popular live-stream concerts, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is now offering a new performance from its archives every Thursday night at 7:30pm via YouTube. Thursday April 9 you can catch Sir Andrew Davis' Grammy-nominated arrangement of Handel's Messiah (the ultimate Easter banger). The Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) has launched ACO HomeCasts, an extensive and innovative digital content season that will bring the music and musicians of the ACO directly into Australian homes.  Like musicians, authors tour the country with every book release, relying on a network of bookshop events and writers' festivals to ensure their work is properly promoted. The absence of festivals and bookshop storefronts now threaten the livelihoods of writers across the country.  While major writers festivals like the Sydney Writers Festival have had to cancel completely, the Newcastle Writers Festival went ahead — completely online — this past weekend, and the 2020 sessions are available on their YouTube channel. Many local bookshops are still forging ahead with author events via video on Zoom or Facebook, where you can be even more intimate with authors and ask them questions via webcam or in the comments.  Many local independent bookshops — such as Avid Reader in Brisbane, Better Read Than Dead in Sydney and Readings in Melbourne — now also offer free delivery within certain postcodes, with staff delivering purchases to your door via bike and foot. Head to the Australian Independent Bookseller website, pop in your postcode and you'll see shops nearest to you.  Australia's most recognisable built structure, and premier home of the arts, has been forced to shut up shop. In response, the Sydney Opera House has launched From Our House to Yours. Every Wednesday to Sunday night at 6:00pm, the Opera House will release archival footage, live broadcasts and even premieres.    This coming week features an author talk with bestselling children's book author (and actor/comedian) David Walliams (Wednesday April 8, 10:00am); a conversation between Clementine Ford and Flex Mami recorded at All About Women 2020 (Thursday April 9, 8:00pm); a live set from Panda Bear — aka Animal Collective co-founder Noah Lennox (Friday April 10, 8:00pm); author and philosopher Alain de Botton discussing On Love (Saturday April 11, 8:00pm) and the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs' performance of Handel's Messiah — performed in Auslan (Sunday April 12, 10:00am). As featured on Australian Story, Astrid Jorgensen's Pub Choir has connected Australians in large live spaces across the country, redefining what choirs can be.    Now they can no longer meet up in person, Pub Choir has gone online, reinvented itself as a Couch Choir, and asked participants to submit their individual parts from self-isolation. A video editor then stitches the parts together to glorious results.  In less than a week, their version of Close to You was viewed over 300,000 times, with over 1,000 people from 18 countries participating.

3,/news/2020-04-08/arts-sector-say-need-emergency-funding-to-survive-shutdown/12130398,Coronavirus has shut down Australia's arts industry but artists say the Government has ignored them,"Artists were among the first workers affected by government interventions to inhibit the spread of COVID-19, when the lights were turned out at every theatre and nearly every exhibition space in Australia. MEAA Equity president Chloe Dallimore has summarised the outcome as ""mass job losses, overnight, with no entitlements/benefits"". TV presenter and performer Julia Zemiro said she has serious fears for friends and colleagues and is regularly checking in with them. ""The arts have been slammed, we need to put it out there that artists have a unique set of circumstances in how we work,"" she said.   As Parliament prepared to sit on Wednesday to consider the next stimulus measures, artists' calls for sector-specific support measures were increasingly distressed. On Tuesday, the National Association for Visual Arts (NAVA) launched the 24-hour campaign #createaustraliasfuture, in which big names like Richard Roxburgh, Julia Zemiro, John Bell and Rachael Maza rally behind the cause. New figures compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal 53 per cent of small arts and recreation businesses have now closed their doors. The figures capture a very broad range of organisations but even so, they are higher than every other sector, including accommodation and food services — which has seen 31 per cent of businesses closed.   Hospitality workers with regular shifts are eligible for the Federal Government stimulus schemes but the majority of arts workers are not. For example, Amala Groom, one of 50,000 artists who make up the 600,000 workers in Australia's $100 billion arts sector, is not eligible for JobSeeker.  Groom started working as a conceptual artist in her mid-30s, after a successful career in Aboriginal advocacy that took her to the United Nations.   Six years later, the Wiradjuri woman was poised to enjoy a breakthrough year with a back-to-back international schedule of paid residencies, institutional and commercial exhibitions, and major projects including her first documentary — all of them career highlights. All this is now cancelled and she does not even know what to work towards as galleries cannot schedule exhibitions with any certainty and most art prizes are on hold.   ""How do I prove [this year's work ever existed] when it was all in the future?"" Groom said. ""Unless the Australian arts sector gets an industry-specific stimulus package, it's going to be impossible for artists like me to claim any [income] support"".    Julia Zemiro has recorded all but two episodes for her upcoming ABC series Home Delivery. She is disappointed to have cancelled the big annual RocKwiz Easter weekend Melbourne Comedy Festival live show and regional tour, which she hosts. She is heartbroken about the cancellation of her second, and what was to be her final, Adelaide Cabaret Festival as artistic director in June, and the opportunities it would have provided performers, that will in all likelihood now never happen. Groom and Zemiro's patchwork careers are typical of all kinds of workers in the arts. The I Lost My Gig website, established to track COVID-19-related cancellations, has logged $330 million in lost gigs. Under the headline ""Support is Here"" it lists a phone number for the music and performing-arts wellbeing helpline Support Act, and a phone number for Lifeline. Dozens of artists have added their voices to a whole-of-industry campaign launched under the banner ""Create Australia's Future"" seeking allowances for the patchwork, freelance and uneven nature of arts work. Richard Roxburgh said the industry shutdown would result in the loss of Australian stories.   ""Every artist has lost their audience and therefore the income stream they normally generate for themselves. This industry is on the brink of collapse,"" he said. ""We are keenly aware we are not on the frontline wearing PPE but we are your voice. We need to make sure after this pandemic has passed Australia still has a voice to tell the beautiful, eccentric, crazy, dark, hilarious and profound stories of who we are as a people,"" Roxburgh said. Groom, Zemiro and Roxburgh are joined by Mitchell Butel and John Bell, directors Daina Reid and Rachael Maza, fellow artists Sally Smart and Abdul-Rahman Abdullah representing freelancers and more than 160 organisations that engage them. Smart has not even seen the finished exhibition of her work being staged by Bendigo Art Gallery in Victoria, which was open for one day before the doors were closed. She is among the lucky ones, because her exhibition, years in the making, was completed and funded — but there are no guarantees an audience will ever see it, and future commissions are in jeopardy. ""We want the Prime Minister to acknowledge how the sector is suffering, as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has done,"" Smart said.   Arts minister Paul Fletcher said when the JobSeeker and JobKeeper schemes were announced that they could amount to billions in assistance for the arts. ""We know COVID-19 is having unprecedented effects on our artists, arts workers and the entire sector. This measure protects jobs, supports individuals and hands a lifeline to organisations during this challenging period,"" Minister Fletcher said. However, these measures are ineffectual for many arts organisations.    On the employer side, organisations need to show at least 15 per cent COVID-19-related downturn in income if they are not-for-profit, and 30 per cent if they're for-profit — but uneven cash flow is typical for arts organisations funded by box office and sometimes grants, sponsorship and philanthropy. These companies are under huge pressure to be eligible because at the moment they feel like they are letting their casual workers down. ""We need a different way of demonstrating eligibility,"" said Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts and campaign leader.   As it stands, organisations which should be eligible are not, she said.  Artspace in Sydney is a case in point: it is ineligible for JobKeeper because it receives a significant amount of income from philanthropy, benefaction and sponsorship which will likely be reduced by this crisis. Unlike retail, where income over the counter is reasonably regular, Artspace's irregular large chunks of income might not materialise this year on account of the downturn.   The same conundrum is evident at theatres and galleries run by councils and universities, which the Prime Minister has said are ineligible. On the employee side, casuals and those on short-term contracts, such as musical theatre workers engaged for the run of a show, are also ineligible. Cast rehearsing for Disney's Frozen the Musical, due to open in Sydney in July, for example, would have reasonably expected at least a full year of work ahead, even though they had only signed up in recent months. The cast — and crew — are in limbo given the uncertainty about when social distancing restrictions will be lifted, allowing Frozen to open. Currently, they would be ineligible for JobKeeper while they wait. Anatolitis said that rather than having had to work with an employer for a year to qualify for JobKeeper, a three-month qualifying period would better suit the short-term nature of arts work. To receive the more generous payment, double the previous Newstart allowance, workers need to prove a loss of income caused by COVID-19 but, as with businesses seeking to access JobKeeper, that ""loss of income"" can be hard to demonstrate.  Screen director Daina Reid was two weeks into shooting episodes for series four of The Handmaid's Tale in Canada when production was halted and she re-joined her family in Melbourne. Reid is not eligible for JobSeeker due to the duration of her contract and working overseas, but says that being freelance, she carefully manages her finances to accommodate swings and roundabouts.  ""[But] so much of my life is filled with actors, writers and crew, I wanted to add my voice in an effort for this campaign to be heard,"" she said. Anatolitis cites the case of an Adelaide artist who has lost $60,000 on account of Dark MOFO being cancelled — the equivalent of two years' work. Even a modest $1,000 or $2,000 grant from local or state government would result in JobSeeker being lost because the grant is counted as income, even though it is generally for materials and an artist fee.  ""It's truly awful, and so easily repairable,"" Anatolitis said.    ","ABC Arts      By national arts, culture and entertainment reporter Michaela Boland","April 08, 2020"
4,/news/2020-04-08/producers-pivot-to-feel-good-films-amid-covid-19/12120126,Coronavirus pandemic spurs Australian movie producers to favour feel-good films,"Veteran Australian film producers are shelving violent movies in favour of feel-good drama and comedy, anticipating strong demand for uplifting cinema once the COVID-19 lockdown ends.   David Lightfoot is the producer of one of the most terrifying films to come out of Australian cinema in 20 years: the outback horror-thriller Wolf Creek. But you won't find him working on anything like that now.  He is putting violent films on the backburner to focus on uplifting drama and comedy, hoping to anticipate what audiences will want when the COVID-19 pandemic has let up enough for the cinemas to reopen.  ""We wouldn't dare to go making [a] Wolf Creek[-style film] after the virus has settled, because it's just going to scare the living daylights out of people,"" Mr Lightfoot said. ""It's just not going to fly … the market wouldn't touch it. ""People have to recover from the trauma of all this virus stuff.""     Mr Lightfoot said he and other veteran Australian film producers were taking their cues from history.  He cited the dominance of slapstick comedy — Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, and the like — in the decade following the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918, and the success of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire musicals following World War II as evidence that cinema-goers want films that uplift them following a global crisis. ""For over 100 years the same thing [has] happened after every disaster … entertainment and the arts … predominantly lean towards making people feel good,"" Mr Lightfoot said. ""We're quite sure that it's going to happen again. ""We are going to want heroes again … [and] we're going to want the modern version of Love Actually.""   The film industry has, in large part, shut down in Australia because of coronavirus restrictions: it's near-impossible to film scenes when actors must stay 1.5 metres away from one another, and when few people can gather in one place. Releases of major blockbusters — including the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, and Disney's live action remake of Mulan — have reportedly been delayed, while production has been shut down on other major films, including Warner Brothers' The Matrix 4, The Batman, and the Harry Potter spinoff, Fantastic Beasts 3.   In the meantime, Mr Lightfoot and his colleagues are doing what they can — working with government film investment agencies, developing ideas and scripts, and editing, remotely. Tim White is another leading Australian producer expecting a shift towards ""entertaining, uplifting, inspiring"" cinema in the aftermath of the pandemic. His credits include the Heath Ledger action comedy Two Hands, the 2003 historical drama Ned Kelly and last year's popular sci-fi thriller I Am Mother.   Mr White said Australian audiences could expect more films in the vein of last year's biographical drama Ride Like a Girl — about the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup — and the romantic comedy Top End Wedding.  ""Most people want to go to the cinema in particular for either a great, big … rollercoaster experience [such as a Marvel comic book film] or something that's generally going to be uplifting,"" he said. ""The great thing about the cinema is, it's a collective experience … it isn't the same to go watch a comedy sitting on [a] couch. It's just not the same."" Sydney-based producer Louise Smith, who worked on Dance Academy: The Movie and Riot, said she regularly worked on ""feel-good"" films in any case. ""I'm in the fortunate position where I haven't had to pivot,"" Ms Smith said. ""A lot of the projects that I have already been developing have a greater chance of survival … because I think people are looking for optimistic [cinema]."" Ms Smith stressed that nobody could really know what audiences might want in several months' time, but films that make people feel good were probably a good bet. The biggest question, she argued, was what proportion of the Australian film industry would be in a financial position to make movies again once the worst of the pandemic is over. ""The thing that none of us know is how long it will take,"" Ms Smith said. ""I don't think any of us have ever experienced a crisis like this."" Screen Australia chief executive Graeme Mason agreed audiences would likely want ""broader-playing"" films after the shutdown. ""I'd be thinking there'll be more things like Priscilla [Queen of the Desert] and Strictly Ballroom for a period,"" he said. ""It would be foolish to not think that people will not want slightly broader-playing things for a period of time, particularly in Australia where we've had the drought, bushfires, and now COVID-19.""   Mr Mason said filmmakers were in the process of ""working out how to keep going"" and what government support might be available to them, like many Australian workers and businessowners during the COVID-19 shutdown. ""They're looking at what they can do for themselves and what they've got on and what federal and state moneys are available to them, I think everybody will be just working out how to keep going,"" Mr Mason said. ""We're looking at ways to support them to get something from state and federal grants and how can we help them get going again when this over."" Screen Australia last week announced it would more than double funding for its high-budget story development grants program. Other government film agencies are also offering support, including the South Australian Film Corporation, which will fund business resilience training for freelance cast and crew, and look to establish connections with universities to encourage paid guest lecturing opportunities.   Another Sydney-based producer, Rosemary Blight (The Sapphires, Invisible Man) said she was not deliberately pivoting away from violent films because of coronavirus; rather, she was focusing on films that would allow viewers to ""escape"" their realities. ""People want great, dramatic stories … to escape into [another] world,"" she said. ""Whether that world is a feel-good world or … it's a world that scares the hell out of you … people will want engrossing stories. ""We're looking at a slate that's quite an eclectic [mix of genres].""   Melbourne-based long-time executive producer and film lawyer Bryce Menzies (Ten Canoes, Muriel's Wedding, Red Dog) said that, with the advent of major streaming services like Netflix, Australian films had to be ""extraordinary … out of the box"" productions to make it to cinemas in the first place — no matter which genre they occupy. ""Because your standard fare is available on Netflix, people will not go to the cinema … unless it's remarkable,"" he said. ""Going to the cinema isn't enough — [the film] has to be an experience. ""Films have to be extraordinary, one way or the other.""   Mr White said films that appeal to older woman — a demographic that traditionally frequents specialist cinemas in high numbers — would do particularly well in a post-shutdown world. ""I'm confident that the person with the next [the Best Exotic] Marigold Hotel will really find a willing audience … determined to uplift themselves out of a fairly traumatic period,"" he said. However he said it was unclear how long it might take for them to return to the cinema, since older people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 — and some smaller cinemas were unlikely to survive. Meanwhile younger audiences, Mr White said, were displaying ""an insatiable appetite for really smart, engaging drama of a serious nature"" and watching it on streaming services. But that demographic was ""not really going to the cinema except for the latest Marvel or DC movie"".   Mr White stressed that although he expected a pivot to more feel-good cinema in coming months, that did not mean horror films and psychological thrillers would not be made — because they are especially well-received internationally. ""You'll not see those types of films disappear … they absolutely have commercial application beyond these shores,"" Mr White said. He concluded that although the Australian film industry would inevitably ""contract"" during the coronavirus crisis, it would also adapt and survive. ""It's a challenge that we've got to meet,"" he said. ""I'm actually optimistic … the people who are talented and dedicated will ride through this.""    ",By Bension Siebert,"April 08, 2020"

The Brisbane man and his son capsized on the North Johnstone River, east of Innisfail, and the camera sank to the bottom. They spent an hour looking for it, with no luck, but Mr Clough said he still held out hope he would see the treasured device again. ""Eventually we gave up and I thought 'Well, maybe one day it'll turn up' because it was in a waterproof case,"" Mr Clough said. ""I actually thought that it might be found within a few months, it might end up in a pool downstream or on a little sandy beach and the next lot of people who go rafting down this river might come across it."" 'One day' was in fact eight years later. Incredibly, it only recently washed up on a remote Cape York beach — a staggering 450 kilometres to the north. Hope Vale local Phil Morris and his wife, Reshmi, are avid beachcombers and make regular trips to Cape Flattery to scour through the flotsam and jetsam.    ""I saw this bit of clear, hard plastic. I saw the edge of it and thought it looked like waterproof housing for a camera because we've found a few of them before,"" Mr Morris said. ""As soon as I picked it up, I saw it had a bit of rust stain and sludge on it and thought 'This looks like it's been in the water for a fair while'."" Mr Morris took the camera home, cleaned it up, and thought he would try his luck with a universal charger to get the device to power up. ""The pictures came up and I saw the [dates],"" Mr Morris said. ""I saw the photos and thought 'Wow, these are part of someone's life'. ""Photos on a camera are like your memories, part of someone's life, frozen in time."" That sentiment motivated the aged-care worker to reunite the camera with its owner so he took to social media and put the call out. Just weeks prior to his FNQ father-son bonding trip, Andrew Clough had been on another rafting expedition with a friend in Brazil. It was images from the overseas adventure that Mr Morris posted on several Facebook groups asking if anyone knew the identities of the two men.   In fewer than five hours, a friend of Andrew Clough's saw the post and sent the retired mining engineer a message that left him truly amazed. ""I subsequently contacted Phil and, sure enough, it was the camera that had been lost 450 kilometres to the south of that beach,"" Mr Clough said. ""It's a modern message in a bottle."" Mr Clough had backed up the photos from Brazil upon his return in 2012 but is grateful to now have the images from a special time with his son. ""The exciting thing for me is I took photos on the North Johnstone, which obviously I don't have, but I'm expecting to see photos of my son and myself on this trip that I thought had been lost forever."" The camera will be in transit once again, this time by mail, when Phil Morris mails it back on his next trip to Cooktown. Both men say the experience has sparked a new friendship based on a mutual love of adventure in the outdoors and the Cloughs are planning a trip to the far north so the two can meet in person.

7,/news/2020-04-09/lonely-planet-to-cut-melbourne-office-as-coronavirus-hits-sales/12136662,Lonely Planet to close most of its Melbourne office as coronavirus impacts sales,"Travel publisher Lonely Planet has announced it will close most of its operations in Melbourne and London as the company deals with the impacts of coronavirus on its sales.   The company said it had made the ""difficult decision to reduce its publishing operations for the foreseeable future"". Lonely Planet said it would continue to publish guidebooks and phrasebooks. But it said it would not commission any new ""inspirational"" titles and would stop publishing the Lonely Planet magazine. ""Lonely Planet is currently proposing that its operations in London and Melbourne close almost entirely, with impacts in other Lonely Planet locations around the world,"" the company's communications manager Adam Bennett said. Lonely Planet was founded in 1973 when Australian couple Tony and Maureen Wheeler published their first guidebook, Across Asia on the Cheap. The company became a favourite of many travellers, with its guidebooks pored over in hostels and bars around the world. Mr Wheeler, who no longer has any official role with the company, told the ABC he was ""shocked"" by Lonely Planet's announcement. ""I was surprised and I continue to be surprised, I am waiting to hear more about it,"" he said. He said Lonely Planet had been a healthy business before coronavirus shut down the travel industry. Mr Wheeler said he thought much of the company's activity had still been occurring from the London and Melbourne offices, but said an office in Dublin had been growing. ""It always surprised me how big and busy the UK office was, that was becoming more the centre around the world where things were happening,"" he said. ""Although a lot was still happening in Melbourne as well.""   He said traditionally the company used its UK office to look after European publications, Australia was used to cover the Asia Pacific and an office in the US looked after the Americas. Mr Wheeler said he had heard from staff at Lonely Planet that there had been an increasing push towards using technology to update guidebooks in the past decade, and said the coronarvirus outbreak could prompt the company to accelerate that shift to cut costs. ""Much more they update things where the rewriting is effectively done by the computers,"" he said. ""They feed the prices in, the computer then says what rooms cost in that hotel or a meal at that restaurant, so there has been this increasing automation of the writing process if you like."" He said the coronavirus crisis meant many travel companies will essentially be start-up businesses when they can re-open, but he is hopeful domestic travel will be allowed again in the not-too-distant future. The coronavirus crisis is not the only challenge Lonely Planet has faced in recent years. Its ownership has changed hands twice, with the BBC's commercial arm buying a majority stake in 2007 from the Wheelers. A year later a former guidebook author revealed he had written for Lonely Planet about a country that he had not actually visited. BBC Worldwide later sold the company to NC2 Media — a company based in Nashville, Tennessee in the United States.

9,/news/2020-04-09/history-of-the-oxford-english-dictionary/12010628,How the Oxford English Dictionary was brought to life in a rustic 'scriptorium',"Just to work from ""A"" to ""ant"" took the original Oxford English Dictionary team around 10 years. They thought they'd reach ""Z"" in that time — but gathering definitions for hundreds of thousands of words was a mammoth task, especially in the 1870s without the help of technology. ""It is akin to mapping the human genome. It was that big an enterprise,"" says author Pip Williams, who has researched the dictionary's history. And it ended up taking another six decades to complete. There had been a ""go-to"" wordlist, Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, since 1755. But Williams says it included made-up definitions and idiosyncratic spelling, and was ""completely incomplete"".   The Philological Society of London decided they needed a better dictionary — one that documented every single word in the English language — and appealed to the Oxford University Press to fund it. Editor Frederick Furnivall kicked things off, but his work didn't prove fast enough. So a few years in, James Murray, an old school teacher, took over. Murray worked from his Oxford home, in a corrugated iron shed at the back of his garden that had the romantic designation of ""scriptorium"". ""That's where he and his team of lexicographers and assistants went every day to collate and to draft the definitions of every word in the English language,"" Williams says. But they didn't work alone. Murray enlisted the help of thousands of ordinary people. He sent a call-out to the public, in pamphlets distributed far and wide and republished in certain journals, asking people to find quotations from magazines, journals, books or newspapers containing words he and his colleagues were looking for. People from all around the world began mailing tiny little slips, about the size of a postcard, containing references to words the dictionary team sought. ""They'd be stored in pigeonhole shells around the walls of the shed, that were specifically designed to hold the slips,"" Williams explains. ""Those examples — they were the evidence, essentially, of the meaning of the word.""   The team would sort the slips chronologically to determine the history of word, from the oldest example of its use to the most up-to-date. ""The lexicographers' job was to go through these textual examples of words, fashion meanings and show how a word might have changed throughout history. That's what would be put in as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary,"" Williams says. This is where the Oxford differentiates itself from Australia's Macquarie or Collins dictionaries. ""Those dictionaries give us some modern up-to-date meaning of a word, but they don't give us the history of the word,"" Williams says. ""Whereas the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical text, so it gives you the history of the word. It gives you the earliest known use of the word in text, which is really important. ""It takes you from maybe the 1530s all the way up to 2020."" If you were to look up, say, ""pants"" in a modern Oxford dictionary, you'd learn that in the 1800s the word was considered a ""vulgar abbreviation"" of pantaloons.   The rustic scriptorium, with its busy-bee lexicographers and garden surrounds, might sound idyllic, but it contained tension, too. ""There would be these perennial arguments about which words were worthy of being in the dictionary and which weren't,"" Williams says. Murray wanted a dictionary that documented all words, including the colloquial or informal.   But the delegates of Oxford University Press — who were funding the project — were keen for a more efficient approach. ""They were constantly putting pressure on Murray to curtail the number of words that were in the dictionary,"" Williams says. ""They were saying, 'some words are not as important as others'."" Williams researched the original dictionary for her book, The Dictionary of Lost Words. She was curious about what words were left out, given one specific criterion for entry.   ""If a word wasn't written down, it never had a chance of being in the dictionary,"" she explains. ""How many situations, particularly pre-20th century, would there have been where people were using language in a very specific way, in a very specific situation — like the birthing room, or the laundry, or the scullery, or the coal mine? ""And those words, because they're not written down, because the people who use them are illiterate very often, and because there's nobody listening to them or wanting to record their experience, those words are lost to history, because they're lost to the dictionary."" She says this fact reveals a serious fallibility. ""We do not question dictionaries,"" Williams says. ""If you want to solve a Scrabble dispute, you go to the dictionary and no-one will argue about the validity of the dictionary's meaning of the word. ""And all of a sudden I thought, well, hang on a minute. You can argue it, because the original source is biased.""   And not just because it documents only the written word. At the time of the first dictionary, the texts available to lexicographers — technical manuals, professional texts, literature and journalism — were mostly written by men. ""That first dictionary had to be a gendered text,"" Williams says.  ""The original sources were mostly written by men and the people interpreting them were men; the people drafting the definitions were men. ""They had the power to exclude, and had the power to include.""   But women were significantly involved in the compilation of the dictionary, Williams says. ""There were women assistants. There were women volunteers, but we don't know much about them,"" she says. She is frustrated by the lack of recognition for these women — something exemplified by an event in 1928. That year a dinner was held in London's Goldsmith's Hall to celebrate the completion of all sections of the dictionary — so auspicious an occasion the prime minister Stanley Baldwin presided over it.

""It's super unfortunate, but we had 65 staff across the group and we had to stand everyone down,"" he said. ""We weren't taking pay either so we kind of stood ourselves down too.""     He had to act quickly, so they pooled their drinks at one venue and began operating as what he calls a 'quasi bottle shop'. Mixed six-packs allowed them to sell beer that would probably have gone out of date, and cocktails started being made up and bottled as single-serve takeaways.   Later this month, the company will host an online whisky tasting where people pre-purchase a whisky pack and sit down for an interactive session with business owners via online video streaming. ""I think for us, they're moulded versions of what we were doing, so people are still finding a similar way of joining in,"" Mr Abraham said. ""You can't discount the fact that we have locked up half the population and everyone is looking for stuff to do — there's only so much Netflix you can watch.""   Similar to the whisky tasting, the company will be bringing back a brunch event that used to operate at one of their bars but tailored for the isolation era. ""You'll get a pack and then log in to the portal and we'll have entertainment, pub games, joker poker, bingo and live musicians who have missed out on gigs,"" he said. ""We're trying to break the mould and think of what used to get people excited about going out and putting that into their living room.""     Wollongong engineer Matt Dawson is passionate about supporting small businesses during the coronavirus outbreak. ""I've long been a supporter of local small business and lately I've loved seeing all the small bars open up, mostly owned by young professionals like me,"" Mr Dawson said.  ""When this all happened, I felt the need to support them where possible.""   He has made a conscious effort to purchase takeaway meals and has bought drinks from Ben Abraham's Good Times Only group. ""I work in construction so have been fortunate enough to keep my income for now, so we have dedicated one night a week to each of the local places offering up cool services,"" he said.

""I'm sure it's not easy, but while they keep adapting and offering a safe service, I'll happily give them my business for as long as possible.""   With only one of Ben Abraham's five small bars trading in some capacity, his company has taken a huge financial hit. He is, however, satisfied with the Federal Government's JobKeeper assistance package, which he said would allow him to continue employing about 15 of his staff. He wants to see greater assistance for commercial property rent. ""We need to see some action on commercial leases and mortgages attached to that,"" Mr Abraham said.

13,/news/2020-04-08/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-at-73-of-coronavirus-compli/12132638,Grammy-winning songwriter John Prine dies at 73 of coronavirus complications,"Grammy-winning singer John Prine, who wrote his early songs in his head while delivering mail and went on to become one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, has died due to complications from coronavirus.   He was 73. Prine's publicist confirmed the singer-songwriter died due to complications from COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Nashville. Prine was hospitalised on March 26 suffering from symptoms of COVID-19, according to his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, who was also his manager. ""We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,"" the Recording Academy, which gives out the Grammy Awards, said in a written statement. ""Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John's impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.""   Born in Chicago on October 10, 1946, Prine's older brother taught him to play guitar at the age of 14. After graduating from high school in suburban Maywood, Illinois, Prine worked as a mail carrier for five years, performing in Chicago clubs in the evenings at occasional ""open mic"" nights. He would say later that some of his best-known early songs were written while he walked the streets of Chicago delivering mail.   ""I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books,"" he told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview. ""You just had time to be quiet and think, and that's where I would come up with a lot of songs. If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down."" He was drafted into the US Army in 1966, and was stationed in Germany during the Vietnam War, before returning home to dedicate himself to music and establishing himself as a leading member of Chicago's folk revival scene. Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson fatefully saw Prine performing at the Earl of Old Town club, leading to Prine's signing with Atlantic Records and self-titled debut album, released in 1971. That album, widely praised by critics, contained several songs that would become staples of Prine's catalogue.   They included Angel from Montgomery, about a woman wishing for deliverance from her unfulfilling life, Paradise, about a Kentucky town devastated by strip mining, and Sam Stone, chronicling the downward spiral of a drug-addicted Vietnam War veteran and containing the oft-quoted refrain: ""There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes, Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose."" The songs have since been covered dozens of times by other artists. His early songwriting style earned comparisons with folk great Bob Dylan, who later called Prine one of his favourites. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs,"" Dylan told the Huffington Post in 2009. Prine released a string of albums in the 1970s, winning larger audiences and critical acclaim as his music stretched from folk to country to Americana, often infused with a sense of humour. In the 1980s, fed up with the recording industry, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, releasing albums under that imprint for the next several decades.   He won his first Grammy Award in 1991, Best Contemporary Folk Album, for The Missing Years. He would win a second Grammy in the same category in 2005 for Fair and Square. In December 2019, the Recording Academy honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.   Prine survived squamous cell cancer in 1998, undergoing surgery to his neck and tongue that left his voice with an even deeper, gravelly tone. In 2013, he was diagnosed with cancer in his left lung and had it removed. Prine was able to find humour in his struggle with cancer, joking that it actually improved his voice. The same humour suffused much of his work, alongside its poignant commentary about the struggles and foibles of ordinary people. ""If I can make myself laugh about something I should be crying about, that's pretty good,"" he once said. Reuters    ",,"April 08, 2020"

15,/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-tasmania-struggling-art-sector-adapting/12125686,Megan was in Paris on an arts residency when coronavirus hit. Now she's reimagining her project from home in Tasmania,"Artist Megan Walch was just two weeks into a months-long arts residency in the heart of Paris when coronavirus took hold of France.   ""Everything was closing in Paris like a series of dominoes,"" she said. ""I got to some of the key places I wanted to go to, and I ended up wandering the empty streets of Paris for two days with a camera, documenting what to me was an extraordinary time in that city. ""It was exhilarating and frightening, and it would oscillate between utter exhilaration and being quite nervous,"" she said. When France announced a nationwide lockdown, including the closure of all non-essential public locations, Walch faced being quarantined in her studio, away from family in a foreign country.   ""It wasn't the Paris I went there to work with and being forcibly removed from my family was not a good idea,"" she said. ""It wasn't until I physically boarded the plane that I thought I would get home.""   Upon her return, the painter spent two weeks in quarantine in her Hobart studio where she used her time to devise how best to continue with her original project — reimagining 18th century murals which depicted the French aristocracy as monkeys as contemporary wallpaper. Being able to examine the murals in detail was important to the self-described visual learner. ""It is a question as to whether [the project] can be digitally translated or how, if at all,"" Walch said. It is a problem facing artists everywhere in the time of coronavirus: how best to reimagine and display their work. Tasmania's Government last month announced $1.5 million in new funding for artists and arts organisations whose work was cancelled, postponed or disrupted due to COVID-19.    This included the $500,000 Arts and Screen Digital Production Fund, aimed specifically at artists like Walch. With a month before submissions close, three artists or arts organisations have already applied for funding under that program, while a further 22 applications are in progress.  State Growth deputy secretary of cultural and tourism industry development Jacqui Allen said the criteria were deliberately flexible to allow for innovation and collaboration. ""I think we needed some good news, to be honest,"" Ms Allen said, acknowledging the devastating impact of the coronavirus on Tasmania's broad arts community. ""We know Tasmania's creative and cultural profile is really important for people here. ""It's important for us to be sharing out stories, but it's also going to be part of our strategy to get people to come back and visit Tasmania."" Award-winning actress Marta Dusseldorp and acclaimed director husband Ben Winspear imagine a Tasmania where theatre is performed every night of the week. Archipelago Productions, their stage and screen company, was among three groups scheduled to open Hobart's new Studio Theatre with Angus Cerini's play, The Bleeding Tree.   While the coronavirus pandemic has put this on hold, the pair said their company was pressing on with rehearsals by using Zoom to do readings and analysis, while taking time to recalibrate. ""I actually think it's a really, really good time to inject a whole lots of funds into development because no-one's shooting at the moment,"" Dusseldorp said. ""So a lot of that money can be rerouted until the next financial year and really look to nurturing our writers, our creative minds, and get new works written. ""That's a positive."" ""A lot of the artists we've employed are really part-time, casuals, contract workers. They are very susceptible to falling through the cracks. Funding projects can really help address that,"" Winspear a former resident director with the Sydney Theatre Company, said. Staff at the acclaimed Big hART arts organisation, founded in Tasmania's north-west and focused on working with disadvantaged communities, have agreed to pay parity to ensure the company's survival.   All 20 employees are now paid just above the Government's JobKeeper subsidy of $1,500 per fortnight. According to co-founder and artistic director Scott Rankin, ""it's brought some people who are part-time up a bit and quite a lot of us down"". But it means Big hART will survive until at least October, a relief for a group which usually thinks in weeks instead of months when it comes to viability. ""It's okay maybe with [bigger companies] to [say] 'OK, we'll take a bit of a holiday or lay people off', but if you work in very disadvantaged communities you have to be very careful with the way you treat participants in the projects,"" Rankin said. ""In the end we can't be part of another failure in the life of our constituents or the cohort we work with."" Rankin said Big hART would also look to apply for various grants, but said more action from government was needed. ""If you listen to a podcast for a mental health, if you listen to music, if you get up and listen to Fran Kelly on the radio, if you put your feet on the floor and there's a handmade rug, if you reach for a ceramic mug … that's art, that culture is the lifeblood of who we are, it is us,"" Rankin said. ""The people we entrust to ensure our children and grandchildren have great experiences and express themselves and have a sense of agency and empowerment, that is the work of the arts.""   Walch described the State Government's funding as a much-needed ""care package"" for Tasmania's arts sector and said she hoped to work with local company MadFinch Productions to tell the story of organisations affected by coronavirus. ""A lot of artists are working on low incomes, no incomes, and it's going to wipe out a lot of practitioners,"" she said. ""Artists are also fantastic at creative problem-solving, so if people can creative problem solve and embed their practices in other forms or function in Australia — easier said than done — that would be an ultimate goal.

17,/news/2020-04-07/what-is-quibi-is-it-available-in-australia-a-shortcut-guide/12037942,What is Quibi? Is it coming to Australia? Here's your shortcut guide,"Just when you thought you had watched everything on Netflix while in isolation, a new streaming service has just launched in the US. It's called Quibi and it focuses on short videos for your smartphone. Here's your shortcut guide. It's actually pronounced KWIH-bee and stands for ""quick bites"" of video. Debatable. Quibi is entering an increasingly crowded market of subscription streaming video services including the dominant Netflix, fast-rising Disney+ and other players including Amazon Prime, Apple TV+ and HBO Max. In Australia, there is also Stan and iView among others.  But Quibi CEO Meg Whitman has hinted that offering more variety when people are stuck at home could be a very welcome thing. She told the New York Times: ""Think about how often you use your phone when you're homebound. People who are home with their children would really like a 10-minute break."" Co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said people might be inclined to fire up his product ""in between home schooling or doing chores around the house, or answering emails and being on video chats."" Ms Whitman said the company would now take ""some time to work out the kinks"" after deciding to push ahead with the launch. Movies, shows and other short-form videos specifically made for watching on a phone. Whether you hold the phone sideways or upright, you'll be able to watch in full screen.   This feature means filmmakers deliver two edits — one horizontal, one vertical — and Quibi stitches them together with one audio track. The other key feature is that episodes are only 10 minutes long (you know, to appeal to those impatient, distracted millennials). The start-up behind Quibi is founded by former Disney studios chief and DreamWorks co-founder Mr Katzenberg and has backing from all the major movie studios and entertainment companies. Ms Whitman, who we mentioned earlier, has headed companies such as eBay and HP. At least $US1 billion has been invested in programming. Some of its headliner shows star the likes of:    Chrissy's Court: Think Judge Judy, but with Chrissy Teigen (who's not a real judge). Survive: It's kind of like Lost. There's a plane crash and two passengers survive (one of them is Sophie Turner). They have to work together to make it out of the icy wilderness they're trapped in. Elba vs Block: Actor Idris Elba and precision driver Ken Block go head-to-head in a series of car stunt challenges. That's just a few of what's on offer. The LA Times described it as like the love child of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but there's a bit of scepticism over whether people will pay for watching short videos on a phone.  EMarketer forecasting analyst Eric Haggstrom told Reuters there were ""really good reasons to be sceptical"". For one, it's unclear if people will pay for short videos they can only watch on their phones, Mr Haggstrom said.  The younger audience that Quibi is targeting already consumes short-form entertainment for free on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. ""Quibi is a giant experiment,"" Mr Haggstrom said. Mr Katzenberg said Quibi represented the first time ""professional storytellers"" had tackled the problem of delivering a high-quality viewing experience on mobile. Yep. In 2015, Verizon created a mobile-first entertainment service called Go90, but it was ultimately cancelled after three years. $US5 a month, or $US8 for the ad-free version.  That's on par with Apple TV+ which costs $US5 per month, and undercuts Disney+'s $US6.99 per month and Netflix's most-popular $US13-per-month plan.  There has also been some scepticism about whether people will be prepared to pay for another service during a looming global recession. ""We've been planning this now for a year, more than a year,"" Mr Katzenberg said. ""Obviously we had no idea what we would be facing."" In a nod to consumers who are ""in distress"", he said the company is offering the first 90 days free. ""We are well enough financed to be able to afford to do that."" TBC.

Some of its headliner shows star the likes of:    Chrissy's Court: Think Judge Judy, but with Chrissy Teigen (who's not a real judge). Survive: It's kind of like Lost. There's a plane crash and two passengers survive (one of them is Sophie Turner). They have to work together to make it out of the icy wilderness they're trapped in. Elba vs Block: Actor Idris Elba and precision driver Ken Block go head-to-head in a series of car stunt challenges. That's just a few of what's on offer. The LA Times described it as like the love child of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but there's a bit of scepticism over whether people will pay for watching short videos on a phone.  EMarketer forecasting analyst Eric Haggstrom told Reuters there were ""really good reasons to be sceptical"". For one, it's unclear if people will pay for short videos they can only watch on their phones, Mr Haggstrom said.  The younger audience that Quibi is targeting already consumes short-form entertainment for free on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. ""Quibi is a giant experiment,"" Mr Haggstrom said. Mr Katzenberg said Quibi represented the first time ""professional storytellers"" had tackled the problem of delivering a high-quality viewing experience on mobile. Yep. In 2015, Verizon created a mobile-first entertainment service called Go90, but it was ultimately cancelled after three years. $US5 a month, or $US8 for the ad-free version.  That's on par with Apple TV+ which costs $US5 per month, and undercuts Disney+'s $US6.99 per month and Netflix's most-popular $US13-per-month plan.  There has also been some scepticism about whether people will be prepared to pay for another service during a looming global recession. ""We've been planning this now for a year, more than a year,"" Mr Katzenberg said. ""Obviously we had no idea what we would be facing."" In a nod to consumers who are ""in distress"", he said the company is offering the first 90 days free. ""We are well enough financed to be able to afford to do that."" TBC.

19,/news/2020-04-05/melbourne-laneway-street-art-artists-concerned-for-future/12042794,Melbourne is famous for its laneway street art. But artists work in a 'grey area' — and worry about the future ,"Melbourne's colourful street art entices thousands of tourists into laneways every day, keen to experience the city's culture and snap the perfect photo. But many of the people behind the art are concerned about the city's creative future. Street artists work in a ""grey area"" — their work is spruiked as a tourist destination by the city council, but it's still illegal, even in iconic hotspots like Hosier Lane and AC/DC Lane. ""Hosier Lane is the number one free tourist attraction in Australia,"" artist and Blender Studios director Adrian Doyle says. More than 1 million visitors visit the lane each year.   ""That's huge. It's similar to the amount of people going to the Great Ocean Road,"" Doyle says. ""If that was any other thing they'd be building toilets and shops."" He says Melbourne City Council is caught in the middle on the issue —  it wants the economic benefits the tourists, but also has to acknowledge the law. ""Some of it they like and some of it they don't. And that's clearly the different between street art and graffiti,"" Doyle says. Debate about the laneways — and the line between art and vandalism — intensified in February, after Hosier Lane was ""paint bombed"" using fire extinguishers. Paint was sprayed over most of the murals and across the iconic cobbled bluestone road.   Doyle describes it as ""act of vandalism"" which was ""brutal but kind"". News headlines called the group ""guerrilla painters"", and some questioned whether the city's street art ""freedom"" was ""luring more graffiti vandals"". Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp said although the laneway art was ""forever changing"", the group's actions were ""not in keeping with the spirit of Hosier Lane"".  Victoria Police is still investigating the incident, which it called an ""attack on the street art"". Both the council and police take the view that street art in the laneways is ""legal"" provided the artist has ""proper permission"" before picking up their spray can.   Lukas Kasper, who had two pieces in the laneway before the paint bombing, doesn't have any problem with ""paint going over paint"". ""If there's going to be a space to do a huge project like this, shouldn't it be the socially acceptable, ever-changing painted walls of Hosier Lane?"" he says. But he says it exposes a problem for street artists who work in a legal ""grey area"". ""It's one of those things that's become just like a norm, but technically, there's actually no written laws that says this space is legal,"" Kasper says, while painting in the lane. ""High chances are if a police officer stopped in this laneway right now, nothing would happen. ""But in other paint-covered laneways I've had them take my paint, my details and moved me on."" Doyle, who runs an inner-city studio for street and fine art artists, says police use a ""tag bank"" to collate people's work, particularly graffiti artists. ""Once they've got one of the tags, they link it to all [your other] tags in the tag bank,"" he says.   While the ""graffiti world"" is different to street art, it's where many artists, including Doyle, begin their careers. ""I imagine if I had got caught then with the same penalties now, I wouldn't be running Blender ... because it would have destroyed my life,"" he says. After the paint bombing, he made an impassioned plea for artists to take back ""control of our creative city"" and cited fears about the gentrification of laneway culture and over-zealous police.   ""Someone called the police on my friend whom was painting in Flinders Court recently. And the police came, and my friend got in trouble for painting,"" he wrote. ""I know what we do is a grey area and it's a very divisive issue for local government. But it is crucial to the survival of the creative CBD and its urban culture.  ""How would it look if I sent a well-respected international artist to paint in Flinders Court ... and they were arrested? ""It's a bad look for Melbourne and terrible for Blender."" It was met by silence. ""It's funny. As soon as someone does something like that, everyone seems to care, but nobody wants to do anything,"" Doyle says.   He says Melbourne City Council ""doesn't know where to sit on it because it's illegal"". The council says it is considering Street Art Guidelines ""to assist street artists and provide clarity for all parties"". For Doyle, Hosier Lane and what artists are painting there has changed. ""A lot of the artwork in there is just like marriage proposals or adverts for stuff,"" he says. ""We all have to make a living, I understand that, but that sort of stuff shouldn't be in Hosier Lane.""   He fears the movement has lost its political punchiness. Doyle would like to see creativity — and politics — return to Hosier Lane, and the street art scene more broadly. He reminisces about the stencils and punchy political messages of the early 2000s and speculates that commercialisation is influencing what artists do. ""I think it's almost a picture competition [now] to see who can do the prettiest picture and for me, art needs to have a bit of a punch,"" he says. ""It's meant to make people feel a little bit awkward."" Street art researcher Lachlan MacDowall, from MIECAT Institute, says there is ""still a lot of really direct political work"" — like Peter Drew's Aussie poster campaign.   ""Artists are getting more interested in monetising their work and producing the career out of their work,"" Dr MacDowall adds. He says many are using laneway walls ""as a backdrop for the production of digital content"". ""Basically they're not even painting the wall primarily for the people who will walk in the laneways because there's a much larger audience who will access to the work on digital platforms,"" he says. Doyle is hopeful of a reinvention — he's seen it happen before. He knows the next generation of artists will find a way to keep it fresh. ""Everything in the whole world has gone through a meeting ... street art's not like that,"" he says. ""It's just some dude that just puts it up. There's no meetings and so in a way it's freeing. It's really democratic.""    ",ABC Radio National      By Sarah Scopelianos,"April 05, 2020"

21,/news/2020-04-05/adelaide-biennial-monster-theatres-australian-art-taps-into-fear/12118986,Australian artists tap into current fears and past nightmares in Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art,"In Nathaniel Hawthorne's gothic tale Rappacini's Daughter, a young scholar falls in love with the lonely, cloistered daughter of a scientist who specialises in plant-based poisons, only to discover that this young woman — Beatrice — is in fact one of her father's experiments, and has poisoned him by proximity. Beatrice has breath that kills, is deadly to the touch, and has a ""sister"" who is an equally poisonous purple-flowered plant. She is called monstrous by her erstwhile lover — but it's clear to the reader that she is the only really good and innocent character in Hawthorne's tale. Visitors to Adelaide Botanic Gardens in March were able to judge for themselves: Beatrice is currently in residence there, inside the Museum of Economic Botany — where (prior to the COVID-19 shutdown of galleries and museums) she was taking visitors. This Beatrice is plush and purple and tentacled — more creature than woman. Whether visitors found her compelling or repellent might be the subject of artist Julia Robinson's own experiment. The creature's tentacles are covered in lush silk, some of it shot through with iridescence — but this ""skin"" is patterned with small incisions, or gashes, through which nodules of incipient life bulge.   ""My vision of Beatrice is that she's this kind of metamorphic, loud, brash, birthing, splitting and hybridised creature that's trying to break the edges of her boundaries to sort of tease herself out of this mess,"" says Robinson. Beatrice is part of the Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, one of more than 120 works by 25 artists presented in an edition themed ""Monster Theatres"", curated by the Art Gallery of South Australia's Leigh Robb. It marks the 30th anniversary of the nation's longest-running survey of Australian art. Robinson was reading a book on poisons when she came across a reference to Rappacini's Daughter.  At that point, Robb had already offered the Adelaide artist a spot within the Museum of Economic Botany — and she felt like serendipity put the idea in her path.  ""I was like 'Oh my God', because it describes Beatrice as this toxic plant-woman,"" Robinson recalls. The setting of the museum is more poignant the longer you look: monstrous and monstered Beatrice is hemmed in by glass cases full of pinned specimens — while just outside the museum, in the gardens, her botanical habitat awaits.   Like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein before it, Rappacini's Daughter turns the tables on the reader to reveal that the monster is in fact the man who created the ""monstrous"" being.  That the doctors in both stories care more for science than humankind, and are guided by arrogance rather than compassion, reveals a lot about the era that both authors were writing in.  But more timelessly, these tales reveal the secret truth of monsters: that like beauty, they are in the eye of the beholder; what to one person is monstrous, to another is wonderful. And so this year's Adelaide Biennial becomes a kind of litmus test of our times — for it reveals what each artist, and each audience member, most fears, loathes or rejects (in her curator's essay, Leigh Robb points out that the Latin roots of ""monster"" are the words for ""to warn"" and ""to show""). Robb says she picked the artists before the theme: ""I'd [initially] looked at 10 artists that I wanted to see together, and that I saw as representing really vital strands in Australian contemporary art practice, and ones that had either defined Australian art history or were in the process of reshaping it through pivotal new work, and shapeshifting, interdisciplinary practices.""   She says that the work of this core group of artists revealed common interests and trends: artists using narrative, figuration (as opposed to abstraction) and immersion to sound warnings about, or simply probe, major sources of trauma and anxiety — climate change, colonisation, patriarchy, to name a few biggies. From there, she selected other artists and works that more explicitly fit her theme of ""Monster Theatres"".  The resulting line-up takes us through from pioneering performance artist Mike Parr to young polymath provocateur Abdul Abdullah; from LA and London-based artist Polly Borland (famous for her 90s photo series Adult Babies) to local hero Karla Dickens. This Biennial offers visitors Mike Bianco's quixotic, intimate experience of ""resting with bees"" in the Botanic Gardens, on the one hand, and the spectacular robot-sculpture of veteran performance and body artist Stelarc, on the other.    Some works position themselves in opposition to particular monsters: Hobart-based artist Willoh S. Weiland says ""patriarchy is the monster"", and has created a video tribute to the 300 women, most over the age of 50, who volunteer as guides at the Art Gallery of South Australia. She presents her work inside a curtained, single-person ""shrine"" within the gallery, inviting visitors to pay tribute to these under-recognised (and often ""invisible"") women who mediate many of our experiences with art in the gallery.    In the adjacent gallery space, Sydney artist Abdul Abdullah strikes out against the dynamics of exclusion, with Understudy: a spot-lit microphone on a small stage, with red curtains behind and seating rows in front — and one sole figure sitting expectantly, clothed in head-to-toe fake designer-wear, as if waiting for the main act. Visitors who venture to the front of this faux theatre will see that the figure is a human-primate hybrid with large moist eyes and a snubbed skull-shaped nose — an uneasy mix of endearing and grotesque. Abdullah's work is one of several that pitch their camp at the threshold between horror and wonder, and are made by artists who are subverting mainstream ideas of what is ""monstrous"" or deserving of rejection.   For Perth duo Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, the male-dominated cinema of ""body horror"" is ripe for an intervention: their short film Dark Water taps into tropes of the monstrous feminine, following a grieving young woman into a watery subterranean zone beneath her house, where her body is transformed or re-birthed. The horror in Dark Water draws from a real medical syndrome: when one twin dies in the womb, sometimes the survivor absorbs their body — and carries remnants of their deceased sibling within their body for life.  Dark Water is the third film Coates and Nazzari have made together, and the result of roughly four years of work (including an army of volunteers and an elaborate hand-built backyard aquatic set — from which Coates's lawn hasn't recovered). They spent months making the props, which include the fantastical aquatic lifeforms: ""evolved"" versions of species endemic to Western Australia's coastal waters.   All their work together centres around ideas of women and water — specifically, the mythologies and superstitions around the sea and sailors. They share an interest in the aesthetics of Australian gothic and ""eco horror"", and describe their work as ""oceanic gothic"". For Coates, an interest in the sea stems partly from growing up in the coastal town of Albany (a former whaling town), with a dad who is a diver; Nazzari, conversely, grew up in the landlocked, bone-dry mining town of Kalgoorlie, and developed a fascination with water from the perspective of scarcity. Their interest in horror, meanwhile, is harder to pin down — but Coates says: ""I think both of us — and we've talked about this before — have always had this interest in really looking at things closely, and not looking away. ""I remember as a child, if I saw a dead animal I'd always want to know what happened: How did it die? What did it look like inside? It was that sort of interest in biology; in the blood and guts of what's inside of me.""   They see Dark Water as reclaiming the unique female potential of horror — a genre that has historically been made by and for men. Nazzari says: ""A lot of why women are interested in horror is to do with education and protecting and preserving yourself … We will happily watch the woman holding her car keys and being scared, because in some ways we're thinking — how does that protect you?"" Coates chimes in: ""I think also, when they say that horror and the abject is this unfamiliarity with the insides of our bodies, and this rejection of it — I don't entirely agree with that. I think for women, we're actually not unfamiliar with the insides of our bodies. We bleed every month and we give birth."" Bad scientists and body horror don't just belong to fiction, of course — and one of the Biennial's most compelling works is inspired by a real-life Australian monster. In the Dead House, by Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu peoples), responds to Adelaide Botanic Gardens' dark history as a site where Scottish-born doctor and anthropologist William Ramsay Smith conducted experiments on the corpses of Aboriginal people and ""unclaimed"" bodies, in his position as Adelaide Coroner.    Ramsay Smith's own writings reveal he robbed graves for his collection; he also stole remains from Aboriginal burial grounds. After his death, 182 skulls were found in his home. ""He had this macabre interest in decapitating Aboriginal bodies and sending their remains internationally — mostly to the UK,"" says Scarce. ""Because he was the coroner, it's almost like he had free rein."" Scarce's installation occupies a small square brick building that was formerly a morgue attached to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Inside, 30 bulbous forms in translucent, cloudy glass are arranged in careful rows. Scarce explains that these are ""bush bananas"", endemic to central and western Australia.  Each bulb has been cut open, with the glass curling outwards from each wound, like skin. ""They've been cut open to represent that old way of dissecting bodies. It was really important to show that disrespect [with which Ramsay Smith treated the bodies] — the flaying of the bananas was done very roughly.""   The installation has the feeling of a memorial, and like a lot of Scarce's previous works, it deals with ""unnamed"" victims of historical violence.  Scarce was born in Woomera, South Australia, and has made work about the effects of 20th-century nuclear testing on the Kokatha people and members of her family. ""For me, it's really important that I make work that is about these types of stories,"" she says. The monsters in Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens' work are more abstract but no less real than William Ramsay Smith. Her Dickensian Country Show takes over an entire gallery space and turns it into a ""fun fair"" with a dark twist: there's a ""Colonial Roundabout"", and rides titled ""Live Stock"" and ""Warn a Brother"" — each of these repurposing vintage carnival rides to create sinister allusions.   Around the perimeter of the room, dense collage-work ""posters"" mash up 19th and 20th-century carnival and circus imagery with text to provocative effect: a nightmarish assemblage of monster masks sits alongside hand-written text reading ""True horror is Australia's history of massacring its first people"". Another poster shows Pauline Hanson in a clown nose and a blood-spattered ruff. A spoof of a ""palm reading"" poster reads: ""You don't need a third eye to see the planet's f*%ked."" Koalas are everywhere — lightening the mood, but also avatars for country and environment.  The effect of this maximalist gallery space is almost like a 3D collage. ""Why I love collage so much is that people come in here and it's triggering stuff in their memory,"" says Dickens.  ""Once people's memories are opened a little bit, then their hearts are a bit more engaged.""   A Dickensian Country Show takes as its springboard Australia's chequered Indigenous circus history — from 20th-century ""Wizard of Wire"" Con Colleano (who ""passed"" as Spanish during his career) to boxing tent champs like Jack Hassen and Jerry Jerome.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Indigenous Australians were kidnapped and forced to perform in circuses (including PT Barnum's Greatest Show on Earth), but over the ensuing decades, many of them adapted the form and made it their own — in some cases (like Colleano, who was world famous) turning it to their advantage. ""And the thing about circus too is that people were embraced — the misfits and the outcasts. Your colour or your disabilities were celebrated, not shunned,"" says Dickens. A Dickensian Country Show is a major work, and Dickens has created a counterpart titled A Dickensian Circus in the foyer of the Art Gallery of NSW, as part of the Biennale of Sydney. Work of this scale was only possible thanks to a $80,000 visual arts fellowship from the Copyright Agency, and funding from Create NSW. Next door to Karla Dickens' warped ""country show"" is an assemblage of rocks, rusted steel drums, wire and supersized drill bits that looks vaguely ominous — almost like an instrument of torture. In fact it's an instrument of sound, designed to be played by musicians using modified bows; the rocks are suspended by wires such that they produce different pitches (effectively, it's a very unwieldy string instrument).    Quandamooka artist Megan Cope conceived this instrument as a way to recreate the distinctive, eerie cry of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone curlew, which is often likened to the wailing of a woman or baby. It's a bird that is both native and thriving on her home of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) but endangered in New South Wales and Victoria. For Cope, colonisation, capitalism and our 'extraction mindset' are the monsters.  The seed of the idea for her Biennial work, which is titled Untitled (Death Song), was sown in an earlier sound work, from 2018, in which she built an instrument using rocks from the Newcastle region (the lands of the Awabakal people) ""to enable the elements of country to sing its story of change upon colonisation"".  The drill bits used in Untitled (Death Song) come from mining machinery; the rocks are from the South Australian Museum: ""They're millions of years old … [but] we overlook their knowledge,"" says the artist. When curator Leigh Robb approached Cope about being part of the Monster Theatres exhibition, the artist immediately knew she wanted to produce another sound work — ""because we're just so overstimulated, visually, these days — and we're not really listening to the warnings"". ""And I think there's a lot of warnings [to listen to],"" she adds.  ""In our culture we learn [to hear] those warnings through the process of listening — with your eyes and with your ears."" Cope's hope is that the musicians who play her instrument — who are asked to learn how to mimic the curlew call — are able to ""connect with these deeper concepts in the work, through that process of slowing down and focusing on the call of the bird"".

From there, she selected other artists and works that more explicitly fit her theme of ""Monster Theatres"".  The resulting line-up takes us through from pioneering performance artist Mike Parr to young polymath provocateur Abdul Abdullah; from LA and London-based artist Polly Borland (famous for her 90s photo series Adult Babies) to local hero Karla Dickens. This Biennial offers visitors Mike Bianco's quixotic, intimate experience of ""resting with bees"" in the Botanic Gardens, on the one hand, and the spectacular robot-sculpture of veteran performance and body artist Stelarc, on the other.    Some works position themselves in opposition to particular monsters: Hobart-based artist Willoh S. Weiland says ""patriarchy is the monster"", and has created a video tribute to the 300 women, most over the age of 50, who volunteer as guides at the Art Gallery of South Australia. She presents her work inside a curtained, single-person ""shrine"" within the gallery, inviting visitors to pay tribute to these under-recognised (and often ""invisible"") women who mediate many of our experiences with art in the gallery.    In the adjacent gallery space, Sydney artist Abdul Abdullah strikes out against the dynamics of exclusion, with Understudy: a spot-lit microphone on a small stage, with red curtains behind and seating rows in front — and one sole figure sitting expectantly, clothed in head-to-toe fake designer-wear, as if waiting for the main act. Visitors who venture to the front of this faux theatre will see that the figure is a human-primate hybrid with large moist eyes and a snubbed skull-shaped nose — an uneasy mix of endearing and grotesque. Abdullah's work is one of several that pitch their camp at the threshold between horror and wonder, and are made by artists who are subverting mainstream ideas of what is ""monstrous"" or deserving of rejection.   For Perth duo Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, the male-dominated cinema of ""body horror"" is ripe for an intervention: their short film Dark Water taps into tropes of the monstrous feminine, following a grieving young woman into a watery subterranean zone beneath her house, where her body is transformed or re-birthed. The horror in Dark Water draws from a real medical syndrome: when one twin dies in the womb, sometimes the survivor absorbs their body — and carries remnants of their deceased sibling within their body for life.  Dark Water is the third film Coates and Nazzari have made together, and the result of roughly four years of work (including an army of volunteers and an elaborate hand-built backyard aquatic set — from which Coates's lawn hasn't recovered). They spent months making the props, which include the fantastical aquatic lifeforms: ""evolved"" versions of species endemic to Western Australia's coastal waters.   All their work together centres around ideas of women and water — specifically, the mythologies and superstitions around the sea and sailors. They share an interest in the aesthetics of Australian gothic and ""eco horror"", and describe their work as ""oceanic gothic"". For Coates, an interest in the sea stems partly from growing up in the coastal town of Albany (a former whaling town), with a dad who is a diver; Nazzari, conversely, grew up in the landlocked, bone-dry mining town of Kalgoorlie, and developed a fascination with water from the perspective of scarcity. Their interest in horror, meanwhile, is harder to pin down — but Coates says: ""I think both of us — and we've talked about this before — have always had this interest in really looking at things closely, and not looking away. ""I remember as a child, if I saw a dead animal I'd always want to know what happened: How did it die? What did it look like inside? It was that sort of interest in biology; in the blood and guts of what's inside of me.""   They see Dark Water as reclaiming the unique female potential of horror — a genre that has historically been made by and for men. Nazzari says: ""A lot of why women are interested in horror is to do with education and protecting and preserving yourself … We will happily watch the woman holding her car keys and being scared, because in some ways we're thinking — how does that protect you?"" Coates chimes in: ""I think also, when they say that horror and the abject is this unfamiliarity with the insides of our bodies, and this rejection of it — I don't entirely agree with that. I think for women, we're actually not unfamiliar with the insides of our bodies. We bleed every month and we give birth."" Bad scientists and body horror don't just belong to fiction, of course — and one of the Biennial's most compelling works is inspired by a real-life Australian monster. In the Dead House, by Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu peoples), responds to Adelaide Botanic Gardens' dark history as a site where Scottish-born doctor and anthropologist William Ramsay Smith conducted experiments on the corpses of Aboriginal people and ""unclaimed"" bodies, in his position as Adelaide Coroner.    Ramsay Smith's own writings reveal he robbed graves for his collection; he also stole remains from Aboriginal burial grounds. After his death, 182 skulls were found in his home. ""He had this macabre interest in decapitating Aboriginal bodies and sending their remains internationally — mostly to the UK,"" says Scarce. ""Because he was the coroner, it's almost like he had free rein."" Scarce's installation occupies a small square brick building that was formerly a morgue attached to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Inside, 30 bulbous forms in translucent, cloudy glass are arranged in careful rows. Scarce explains that these are ""bush bananas"", endemic to central and western Australia.  Each bulb has been cut open, with the glass curling outwards from each wound, like skin. ""They've been cut open to represent that old way of dissecting bodies. It was really important to show that disrespect [with which Ramsay Smith treated the bodies] — the flaying of the bananas was done very roughly.""   The installation has the feeling of a memorial, and like a lot of Scarce's previous works, it deals with ""unnamed"" victims of historical violence.  Scarce was born in Woomera, South Australia, and has made work about the effects of 20th-century nuclear testing on the Kokatha people and members of her family. ""For me, it's really important that I make work that is about these types of stories,"" she says. The monsters in Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens' work are more abstract but no less real than William Ramsay Smith. Her Dickensian Country Show takes over an entire gallery space and turns it into a ""fun fair"" with a dark twist: there's a ""Colonial Roundabout"", and rides titled ""Live Stock"" and ""Warn a Brother"" — each of these repurposing vintage carnival rides to create sinister allusions.   Around the perimeter of the room, dense collage-work ""posters"" mash up 19th and 20th-century carnival and circus imagery with text to provocative effect: a nightmarish assemblage of monster masks sits alongside hand-written text reading ""True horror is Australia's history of massacring its first people"". Another poster shows Pauline Hanson in a clown nose and a blood-spattered ruff. A spoof of a ""palm reading"" poster reads: ""You don't need a third eye to see the planet's f*%ked."" Koalas are everywhere — lightening the mood, but also avatars for country and environment.  The effect of this maximalist gallery space is almost like a 3D collage. ""Why I love collage so much is that people come in here and it's triggering stuff in their memory,"" says Dickens.  ""Once people's memories are opened a little bit, then their hearts are a bit more engaged.""   A Dickensian Country Show takes as its springboard Australia's chequered Indigenous circus history — from 20th-century ""Wizard of Wire"" Con Colleano (who ""passed"" as Spanish during his career) to boxing tent champs like Jack Hassen and Jerry Jerome.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Indigenous Australians were kidnapped and forced to perform in circuses (including PT Barnum's Greatest Show on Earth), but over the ensuing decades, many of them adapted the form and made it their own — in some cases (like Colleano, who was world famous) turning it to their advantage. ""And the thing about circus too is that people were embraced — the misfits and the outcasts. Your colour or your disabilities were celebrated, not shunned,"" says Dickens. A Dickensian Country Show is a major work, and Dickens has created a counterpart titled A Dickensian Circus in the foyer of the Art Gallery of NSW, as part of the Biennale of Sydney. Work of this scale was only possible thanks to a $80,000 visual arts fellowship from the Copyright Agency, and funding from Create NSW. Next door to Karla Dickens' warped ""country show"" is an assemblage of rocks, rusted steel drums, wire and supersized drill bits that looks vaguely ominous — almost like an instrument of torture. In fact it's an instrument of sound, designed to be played by musicians using modified bows; the rocks are suspended by wires such that they produce different pitches (effectively, it's a very unwieldy string instrument).    Quandamooka artist Megan Cope conceived this instrument as a way to recreate the distinctive, eerie cry of the yellow-eyed Bush Stone curlew, which is often likened to the wailing of a woman or baby. It's a bird that is both native and thriving on her home of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island) but endangered in New South Wales and Victoria. For Cope, colonisation, capitalism and our 'extraction mindset' are the monsters.  The seed of the idea for her Biennial work, which is titled Untitled (Death Song), was sown in an earlier sound work, from 2018, in which she built an instrument using rocks from the Newcastle region (the lands of the Awabakal people) ""to enable the elements of country to sing its story of change upon colonisation"".  The drill bits used in Untitled (Death Song) come from mining machinery; the rocks are from the South Australian Museum: ""They're millions of years old … [but] we overlook their knowledge,"" says the artist. When curator Leigh Robb approached Cope about being part of the Monster Theatres exhibition, the artist immediately knew she wanted to produce another sound work — ""because we're just so overstimulated, visually, these days — and we're not really listening to the warnings"". ""And I think there's a lot of warnings [to listen to],"" she adds.  ""In our culture we learn [to hear] those warnings through the process of listening — with your eyes and with your ears."" Cope's hope is that the musicians who play her instrument — who are asked to learn how to mimic the curlew call — are able to ""connect with these deeper concepts in the work, through that process of slowing down and focusing on the call of the bird"".

27,/news/2020-04-04/bill-withers-dead-at-81/12121238,"Bill Withers, legendary soul singer who wrote Lean On Me, dies aged 81","Bill Withers, the legendary US soul singer who wrote Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine has died aged 81 of heart complications.   The three-time Grammy Award winner, who withdrew from making music in the mid-1980s, died on Monday (local time) in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his family.  He is survived by his wife Marcia Johnson and their two children, Todd and Kori. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world,"" the statement from his family said. ""In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones,"" the statement said.   Withers' songs have become the soundtracks of countless cherished moments. Lean on Me, was performed at the inaugurations of both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.    Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me are among Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ""He's the last African-American Everyman,"" musician and bandleader Questlove told Rolling Stone in 2015.  ""Bill Withers is the closest thing black people have to a Bruce Springsteen."" Many who knew Withers or were inspired by him took to social media to express their grief.  Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda referred to Withers as a ""maestro"", singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz said, ""My soul always has & always will be full of your music"", and singer-songwriter John Legend reflected that ""life won't be the same without him"".   Withers, who overcame a childhood stutter, was born the last of six children in the coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia.  He joined the Navy at 17 and spent nine years in the service as an aircraft mechanic installing toilets.  After his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, worked at an aircraft parts factory, bought a guitar at a pawn shop and recorded demos of his tunes in hopes of landing a recording contract.   In 1971, signed to Sussex Records, he put out his first album, Just As I Am, with the legendary Booker T Jones at the helm.  It had the hits Grandma's Hands and Ain't No Sunshine, which was inspired by the Jack Lemmon film Days Of Wine And Roses.  Ain't No Sunshine was originally released as the B-side of his debut single, Harlem.  But radio DJs flipped the disc and the song climbed to number three on the Billboard charts and spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 40. Withers went on to generate more hits a year later with the inspirational Lean on Me, the menacing Who Is He (And What Is He to You) and the slinky Use Me on his second album, Still Bill.   Later would come Lovely Day, co-written with Skip Scarborough and featuring Withers holding the word ""day"" for almost 19 seconds, and Just the Two Of Us, co-written with Ralph MacDonald and William Salter.  His Live at Carnegie Hall in 1973 made Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time. ""The hardest thing in songwriting is to be simple and yet profound. And Bill seemed to understand, intrinsically and instinctively, how to do that,"" Sting said in Still Bill, a 2010 documentary of Withers. Though his songs often dealt with relationships, Withers also wrote ones with social commentary, including ""Better Off Dead"" about an alcoholic's suicide, and ""I Can't Write Left-Handed,"" about an injured Vietnam War veteran. He was awarded Grammys as a songwriter for Ain't No Sunshine in 1971 and for Just the Two Of Us in 1981. In 1987, Withers received his ninth Grammy nomination and third Grammy as a songwriter for the re-recording of the 1972 hit Lean on Me by Club Nouveau.   He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 by Stevie Wonder.  ""I'm not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with. I don't think I've done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West Virginia,"" Withers told Rolling Stone in 2015. ABC/AP",,"April 04, 2020"

The three-time Grammy Award winner, who withdrew from making music in the mid-1980s, died on Monday (local time) in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his family.  He is survived by his wife Marcia Johnson and their two children, Todd and Kori. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world,"" the statement from his family said. ""In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones,"" the statement said.   Withers' songs have become the soundtracks of countless cherished moments. Lean on Me, was performed at the inaugurations of both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.    Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me are among Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ""He's the last African-American Everyman,"" musician and bandleader Questlove told Rolling Stone in 2015.  ""Bill Withers is the closest thing black people have to a Bruce Springsteen."" Many who knew Withers or were inspired by him took to social media to express their grief.  Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda referred to Withers as a ""maestro"", singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz said, ""My soul always has & always will be full of your music"", and singer-songwriter John Legend reflected that ""life won't be the same without him"".   Withers, who overcame a childhood stutter, was born the last of six children in the coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia.  He joined the Navy at 17 and spent nine years in the service as an aircraft mechanic installing toilets.  After his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, worked at an aircraft parts factory, bought a guitar at a pawn shop and recorded demos of his tunes in hopes of landing a recording contract.   In 1971, signed to Sussex Records, he put out his first album, Just As I Am, with the legendary Booker T Jones at the helm.  It had the hits Grandma's Hands and Ain't No Sunshine, which was inspired by the Jack Lemmon film Days Of Wine And Roses.  Ain't No Sunshine was originally released as the B-side of his debut single, Harlem.  But radio DJs flipped the disc and the song climbed to number three on the Billboard charts and spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 40. Withers went on to generate more hits a year later with the inspirational Lean on Me, the menacing Who Is He (And What Is He to You) and the slinky Use Me on his second album, Still Bill.   Later would come Lovely Day, co-written with Skip Scarborough and featuring Withers holding the word ""day"" for almost 19 seconds, and Just the Two Of Us, co-written with Ralph MacDonald and William Salter.  His Live at Carnegie Hall in 1973 made Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time. ""The hardest thing in songwriting is to be simple and yet profound. And Bill seemed to understand, intrinsically and instinctively, how to do that,"" Sting said in Still Bill, a 2010 documentary of Withers. Though his songs often dealt with relationships, Withers also wrote ones with social commentary, including ""Better Off Dead"" about an alcoholic's suicide, and ""I Can't Write Left-Handed,"" about an injured Vietnam War veteran. He was awarded Grammys as a songwriter for Ain't No Sunshine in 1971 and for Just the Two Of Us in 1981. In 1987, Withers received his ninth Grammy nomination and third Grammy as a songwriter for the re-recording of the 1972 hit Lean on Me by Club Nouveau.   He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 by Stevie Wonder.  ""I'm not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with. I don't think I've done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West Virginia,"" Withers told Rolling Stone in 2015. ABC/AP",,"April 04, 2020"
29,/news/2020-04-04/tiger-king-netflix-series-is-capitalist-fever-dream/12114106,"Tiger King, Netflix's new true crime series, is a wild ride into the modern American psyche","OJ Simpson was shocked. ""Oh my God,"" he said on Twitter this week.  ""Is America in this bad a shape?"" He was talking about Tiger King, a docuseries that launched on Netflix two weeks ago and is currently the most popular title on the platform in Australia. When even OJ Simpson, who basically invented using popular culture to distract from your criminal history, thinks this is all a bunch of absolute insanity, it makes you pause. Here's why everyone is talking about Tiger King and what it can teach us about the modern American psyche. You've probably seen people recommending Tiger King as a coronavirus-anxiety balm, expressing disbelief at its lunacy or just nonchalantly sharing memes featuring Joe Exotic, the self-described ""gay, gun-carrying redneck with a mullet"". The seven-part series traces the exotic animal market in the United States and, in particular, the small private zoos that showcase those animals to the public. It's partly an examination of the kind of people who do this in a country where loose regulation has led to exploitation, captive breeding and all-out fiascos like the one in Zanesville, Ohio, in 2011, where dozens of exotic animals were shot after being released from a private zoo. But it's also — because this is Netflix — a true-crime drama. There's a murder-for-hire plot and a millionaire who disappeared and may or may not have been fed to tigers.   Then there are the characters.  Hoo boy.  Where to start with them? Joseph Maldonado-Passage, who calls himself Joe Exotic, keeps more than 200 tigers in a ramshackle ""roadside zoo"". Because this is America, he also keeps a film crew that shoots an internet talk show (fronted by him) and makes tiger-themed videos for his country music side-hustle (not a joke).   He is also, we learn in the first episode, mixed up in a plot to have a fellow zoo-owner murdered. ""There was something so odd about the man, and yet he had so much confidence, because he owned the world in his head,"" Rick Kirkham, who was Joe's on-site TV producer, says. It is exhausting trying to recount the various ways in which these people are unbelievable. Joe's mentor is fellow zoo owner Bhagavan ""Doc"" Antle, a ponytailed former Hollywood exotic animal handler with very little in the way of humility and a doctorate in ""mystical science"".   Aside from keeping exotic animals, he keeps women — possibly, the directors suggest, against their will. He has several ""partners"", who have their own residences on the grounds of his zoo in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  One former employee recounts being worked seven days a week and pressured to get breast implants, eventually relenting only so she could get a few days' rest. ""He would say, 'They're free to leave,"" the former employee, Barbara Fisher, says of Antle's female companions.  ""But that's the way it is in all cults."" While he claims to love his animals and adhere to US Department of Agriculture guidelines, he also subjects the cubs to petting by humans and engages in cross-breeding, both of which are discouraged by animal welfare advocates.   Then there's Carole Baskin. Baskin appears at first like the show's baseline of integrity, an ageing Floridian hippie on a quest to shut Joe Exotic down because, she says, he abuses animals and engages in irresponsible breeding practices. But the series questions not only her prior breeding and animal acquisition practices but covers more salacious ground: that she is reportedly the prime suspect in the disappearance of her wealthy husband, Don Lewis. There are many small private zoos in the United States — what are known as ""roadside zoos"". Often, according to the Animal Legal Defence Fund, they keep exotic animals in poor conditions because state and federal regulation is poorly enforced or provides too many loopholes. The situation is the same when it comes to private ownership.  In some US states, there's less paperwork involved in getting a lion than a dog, according to reporting by National Geographic magazine.  The trade in exotic animals has been booming in recent years, due in part to social media. The World Wildlife Foundation estimates there are 5,000 tigers in the United States, most of them in private residences. That's one of the largest populations anywhere in the world. You can't import exotic animals, but those rules overlook captive breeding, which is how most Americans end up living with exotic pets and which can expose animals to genetic problems. A federal bill that would ban private ownership and cub petting has, despite Baskin's political advocacy, been stalled for the past three years. Only in the United States, right? The series is a reminder of the way Americans' absolutist view of personal liberty can become problematic. ""When I woke up this morning I was in a free f***ing country,"" says Jeff Lowe, a big cat fan whose flashy, playboy lifestyle attracts Joe.  ""And I'm still there.""   Many of these characters believe that nobody, least of all the government, can stop you from pursuing even the most evidently destructive of business practices. In one scene, Joe Exotic — who once ran for president because he thought it would be good for business — tells a TV interviewer that not only will he continue to operate his zoo after an employee loses an arm to a tiger but that if the authorities tried to take his animals away there would be ""a small Waco"". Meanwhile, one of Doc Antle's employees describes, with a resigned smile, working ""8am to midnight"" every day. In a country with little social safety net and a federal minimum wage of $US7.25 ($11.76) an hour, where success and failure are individualised, this is not surprising. At Joe's zoo, his workers raid the meat truck, which delivers discarded supermarket supplies that will be used to feed the tigers. The stuff that isn't passed its use-by date is fair game.   All this is reminiscent of another recent Netflix docuseries, Cheer. That series, about the hectic world of collegiate cheerleading, turned its central character, Navarro College cheer coach Monica Aldama, into a folk hero.  But what it also did was show a kind of capitalism in micro: disenfranchised young people enduring back-breaking misery in the service of a victory they are told is theirs but that really rewards the people above them. So ... where does this all leave us? Carole Baskin had a fairly strong reaction to the docuseries. In a lengthy blog post, she outlined what she said were a series of lies and inaccuracies about her sanctuary, Big Cat Rescue, and the way it treats its animals, employees and volunteers. She also said the show ""had the sole goal of being as salacious and sensational as possible to draw viewers"". ""As part of that, it has a segment devoted to suggesting, with lies and innuendos from people who are not credible, that I had a role in the disappearance of my husband Don in 1997. ""They did not care about truth,"" she said of the directors, Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin. ""The unsavoury lies are better for getting viewers."" Joe Exotic, who remains in jail, is enjoying his newfound support and his 15 minutes of fame, Goode told The New York Times. This month he filed a lawsuit against the US Government seeking nearly $US100 million in damages because he was, he says, falsely convicted. Antle said on Facebook the staff of his Myrtle Beach Safari zoo were ""very disappointed"" with the Netflix series. ""It is important to understand that this series is not a documentary; it's sensationalised entertainment with paid participants,"" he said. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister appealed this week for anyone with information about the disappearance of Don Lewis to come forward.   Meanwhile, the internet continues to eat this all up — the sordid lives of the haves, the have-nots, the strivers and the down-and-outs becomes mass entertainment. At one point, Kirkham, the producer who sought to turn Joe's life into a reality TV show, says: ""It's just a crazy little comedy between exotic animal lovers.""

31,/news/2020-04-03/arts-theatre-companies-australia-council-funding/12119924,"Arts sector hit again as La Mama Theatre, Sydney Writers' Festival and others lose Australia Council funding amid coronavirus shutdown","Already cash-strapped in the face of coronavirus, Australia's arts sector says it's been further devastated after dozens of organisations lost federal funding. Melbourne's La Mama, the tiny 53-year-old company recognised as the birthplace of Australian theatre, is among 49 arts companies to lose funding from the Australia Council, the Government's arts funding body. Other casualties are high-profile troupes for young people including the St Martins and Polyglot theatres in Melbourne, Barking Gecko in Perth, and Sydney's Australian Theatre for Young People, which counts Nicole Kidman, Baz Luhrmann and Rebel Wilson among its alumni. Sydney Writers' Festival failed to secure funding, as did the Museum of Contemporary Art. Theatre Network Australia executive director Nicole Beyer said the sector was ""devastated and shocked so many companies have lost funding"". ""This has happened because the Australia Council's funding has been frozen since 2013 — in fact it's been chipped away at by about $6 million a year,"" Ms Beyer said. She said the loss of key funding would result in the closure of some smaller companies, while larger organisations would need to scale back their activities, cancel some programs or make up the money from elsewhere. ""The problem is, with the impact of COVID-19 as well, there's nowhere for them to get extra funding from,"" she said. Australia Council funding is awarded every four years via a competitive application process, and organisations must reapply at the end of the funding cycle. The council flagged these cuts last year, when, faced with limited funding, it decided to fund fewer companies, but give them more money. Ninety-five organisations, including Indigenous companies Ilbijerri and Yirra Yaakin, were successful in securing funding and will receive up to $500,000 a year for four years from 2021. La Mama chairman Richard Watts said it was the second blow for the theatre company in a year and a half, after its theatre was burned down by an electrical fire.   La Mama relies on the Australia Council for a significant proportion of its funding, but Mr Watts said the loss would not spell the end of the company, which has at different times been home to artists including Cate Blanchett, Jack Hibberd, Graeme Blundell, Judith Lucy and Julia Zemiro. In recent days the Australia Council has attempted to ease the pain of the almost-complete shutdown of the performing and visual arts sectors.  It redirected $5 million in funding towards a Resilience Fund immediately accessible to the sector, and it delayed the announcement of the four-year funding by a week while it sought to soften the blow. It has done that by continuing some funding for an extra year, until 2022.   That means the 49 companies whose funding will ultimately be discontinued will receive a lifeline, in the form of a smaller amount of funding, for 2021. The Australia Council funded this stop-gap with an additional $4 million saved from other activities and by asking the successful companies to absorb a 30 per cent reduction in their grant for 2021. The executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts, Esther Anatolitis, said arts organisations needed their funding boosted rather than cut. ""Despite unprecedented whole-of-industry collaboration in outlining urgent needs for stimulus to prevent industry collapse, I am deeply concerned that those specific needs are not understood,"" she said. ""At this perilous time we should be increasing funding for the organisations that power the industry, not undermining their capacities."" Australia Council chief executive Adrian Collette said the arts had been dealt a particularly bad blow with the COVID-19 shut down, and they one-year stop-gap funding was an acknowledgement of that. ""We were working with the Government on a package that might have meant more for four-year funding, but in these circumstances [COVID-19] that was a conversation that really did get overwhelmed."" He acknowledged some companies would struggle to continue. ""There will certainly be some [companies] that will face insolvency and they're the ones we really have to focus on during the next three months or so,"" he said.","By arts, culture and entertainment reporter Michaela Boland","April 06, 2020"

35,/news/2020-04-02/indigenous-dot-paintings-coronavirus-health-message-uluru/12110988,Uluru artists depict COVID-19 health messages through traditional Indigenous dot paintings,"Indigenous artists have taken the COVID-19 messaging into their own hands at Mutitjulu, the small Aboriginal community nestled at the base of Uluru, 500 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs.   As soon as the Federal Government announced the coronavirus health messaging, the artists at the Walkatjara Art Centre started to interpret the messaging into traditional dot paintings. Indigenous interpreter, Kathy Tozer, helps facilitate meetings between the Anangnu people and Parks Australia. ""We called a meeting straight away when we heard about coronavirus so that Anangnu could speak about how they were feeling about it,"" she said.  ""One of the things that came up was that they wanted to put messages out around the community. ""To let all the people in the community know that you shouldn't be travelling and all of the safety messages.""     Seven artists from the community have painted the messages onto canvases. ""They are hanging in different places around the community,"" Ms Tozer said. ""[In] the store, next to hand washing station, in the clinic, in the job network … so that people can see messages in their own language and in their own iconography.""   Yaritji Miller's painting depicts Australia in the centre of the canvas with two hands. ""To block the disease from coming onto our country,"" she said. Ms Miller said that there has been a range of emotions and attitudes for Mutitjulu residents to process. ""Some of us are really quite worried. Some of us are scared,"" she said. ""Some people don't understand the full implications of this."" The artists all agree that it is essential for community members to recognise the seriousness of coronavirus and the need to protect the vulnerable in the community.   ""We do have to think about this new danger that's come to us,"" Ms Miller said. ""And we do have to understand that now there are new rules, and that some of which are made by governments that we need to pay attention to, and not just think it's something that won't affect us."" Pollyanne Mumu's canvas represents a group of Anangnu together with health staff. ""They have brought all of the paper information that tells us about the new dangerous disease,"" she said.  Having never seen an image of what the virus looked like, all the artists agreed that they used their imaginations to translate it into dot art form. ""That's just how our minds work,"" Ms Mumu said. ""When we visualised it that's the image that came to our mind. So that's how we portrayed it.""   Parks Australia announced on March 24 that all parks within their jurisdiction, including Uluru and Kata Tjuta, would be temporarily closed for a minimum of two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Artist Elizabeth Wilson says she welcomes the closure, believing it is necessary in order to protect the community members who sell their art directly to tourists at Uluru's sunset viewing area. ""It's the right thing to shut the park because of the dangers of the virus,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will be before we can open the park to tourists again. ""But we do look forward to that time because a lot of people have no other income than the money that they can make from selling their canvases to tourists. ""So whilst it was really important for our community safety we're glad that it closed.""    Before the park was temporarily shut Ms Wilson painted about the dangers of her community making physical contact with tourists.

36,/news/2020-04-02/indigenous-dot-paintings-coronavirus-health-message-uluru/12110988,Uluru artists depict COVID-19 health messages through traditional Indigenous dot paintings,"Indigenous artists have taken the COVID-19 messaging into their own hands at Mutitjulu, the small Aboriginal community nestled at the base of Uluru, 500 kilometres south-west of Alice Springs.   As soon as the Federal Government announced the coronavirus health messaging, the artists at the Walkatjara Art Centre started to interpret the messaging into traditional dot paintings. Indigenous interpreter, Kathy Tozer, helps facilitate meetings between the Anangnu people and Parks Australia. ""We called a meeting straight away when we heard about coronavirus so that Anangnu could speak about how they were feeling about it,"" she said.  ""One of the things that came up was that they wanted to put messages out around the community. ""To let all the people in the community know that you shouldn't be travelling and all of the safety messages.""     Seven artists from the community have painted the messages onto canvases. ""They are hanging in different places around the community,"" Ms Tozer said. ""[In] the store, next to hand washing station, in the clinic, in the job network … so that people can see messages in their own language and in their own iconography.""   Yaritji Miller's painting depicts Australia in the centre of the canvas with two hands. ""To block the disease from coming onto our country,"" she said. Ms Miller said that there has been a range of emotions and attitudes for Mutitjulu residents to process. ""Some of us are really quite worried. Some of us are scared,"" she said. ""Some people don't understand the full implications of this."" The artists all agree that it is essential for community members to recognise the seriousness of coronavirus and the need to protect the vulnerable in the community.   ""We do have to think about this new danger that's come to us,"" Ms Miller said. ""And we do have to understand that now there are new rules, and that some of which are made by governments that we need to pay attention to, and not just think it's something that won't affect us."" Pollyanne Mumu's canvas represents a group of Anangnu together with health staff. ""They have brought all of the paper information that tells us about the new dangerous disease,"" she said.  Having never seen an image of what the virus looked like, all the artists agreed that they used their imaginations to translate it into dot art form. ""That's just how our minds work,"" Ms Mumu said. ""When we visualised it that's the image that came to our mind. So that's how we portrayed it.""   Parks Australia announced on March 24 that all parks within their jurisdiction, including Uluru and Kata Tjuta, would be temporarily closed for a minimum of two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Artist Elizabeth Wilson says she welcomes the closure, believing it is necessary in order to protect the community members who sell their art directly to tourists at Uluru's sunset viewing area. ""It's the right thing to shut the park because of the dangers of the virus,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will be before we can open the park to tourists again. ""But we do look forward to that time because a lot of people have no other income than the money that they can make from selling their canvases to tourists. ""So whilst it was really important for our community safety we're glad that it closed.""    Before the park was temporarily shut Ms Wilson painted about the dangers of her community making physical contact with tourists. ""I've painted about the dangers of doing that now because of the virus,"" she said. ""Because even though it seems invisible, we can still catch it from those tourists that are coming from other parts of the country and the world. ""I painted that scene up with tourists on one side, the canvas in the middle and the artist on the other, and then behind the artists, unknown to themselves, is the virus.""

In February, the singer-songwriter won Australia Decides, outscoring Casey Donovan, Vanessa Amorosi and seven other acts to clinch a spot at Eurovision. However, last month growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus led the European Broadcasting Union and this year's scheduled hosts, the Netherlands, to announce the cancellation of 2020's event.

But SBS has now followed the lead of a number of countries involved in the contest by confirming Montaigne's place as Australia's representative next year. ""I'm so happy to receive this good news during such times,"" Montaigne said in a statement.

With the contest to decide Australia's entrant for next year now not needed, SBS said the focus would turn to developing new music. ""Although SBS and fans alike will miss Eurovision — Australia Decides 2021, this will honour Australia's decision and give Montaigne the chance to show the world what we already know — that she is an incredibly talented, exciting and original artist,"" SBS commissioning editor and Australia's Eurovision head of delegation Josh Martin said.

Neither are the almost 8,000 members of his Facebook group. ""When you talk to scientists about thylacines, you're a bit of a tinfoil hat whack job, because once an animal's declared extinct, that's it, case closed … but they're out there,"" he said. Mr Waters is the president of the Thylacine Awareness Group of Australia, a collection of believers who are convinced the Tasmanian tiger — once the dominant predator across Australia — still roams the island state, and maybe even the mainland. ""I had two sightings in Tassie myself,"" Mr Waters, who lives in Tasmania's north, said.   ""One in 2010 when I was taking the dog for a walk and the second in 2014, when I happened to be peering out my bedroom window and one came walking past late at night.""   The Facebook group and website serve as forums for sharing the items of evidence gathered by people across the country, who also swap notes on the movements, habits and mannerisms of the animal. Since starting his group in 2014, Mr Waters said he had been ""dumbfounded that there was so much information [that] wasn't in the public arena"". Mr Waters said he, and others, use ""basic, citizen science"" to find ""concrete evidence"" of the thylacine's continued existence — employing various types of technology, including cameras and thermal-imaging drones. ""There are plenty of large, interesting footprints in the area where I live, which makes us think there's still plenty around,"" he said.  ""We find the odd kangaroo with its head missing, which is also an indication they're in the area because they like to feed on the blood-filled organs of smaller marsupials.""   Photos of animals torn apart by larger predators, along with images of paw prints, night-vision captures of wildlife in the bush and video stills of what are purported to be sightings also feature on the group's webpages. ""It gives people a safe place to talk about their information where they wouldn't be laughed at or ridiculed,"" Mr Waters said. ""The world is in dire need of good news stories right now and anything that gives people hope and a bit of a focus on the future is going to be a good thing."" The quest for the thylacine has attracted the attention of documentary makers David Elliot-Jones and Naomi Ball, with Screen Australia awarding them a $50,000 grant to make Searching for the Tassie Tiger, a documentary project which will follow Mr Waters and members of his group.   The film, which will be distributed globally by Vice Media, will be shot mostly in north-east and north-west Tasmania, once the coronavirus crisis is over. ""I was really drawn to it because of the environmental element of it,"" said the film's director, Naomi Ball. ""It's very much the same as what we're doing to our environment now on a much larger scale and with the bushfire season that we've had, we're really seeing what human impact can do to our environment."" Ms Ball said despite the official status of the tiger as being extinct, ""people are seeing something"". She said it would be ""wild"" if they managed to capture a thylacine on camera, but that was not their main goal. ""If that happens, I'm going to be absolutely blown away,"" she said.  ""But we're really focussed on the search, the people that are searching and the characters that they are, the reason why they've come to the search and why they've made it their fight.""

Coronavirus was far from the minds of Andrew Balnaves, his husband Carl Matto and their housemate Lisa Ritchie as they danced in sparkly costumes at Cape Town's Bazique Festival. But when the party was over, their new reality set in.       Upon their return to Melbourne they were forced into a mandatory 14-day quarantine period as part of the Government's plan to slow the spread of coronavirus. ""We woke up the next morning and it hit us — oh, we can't go outside,"" Mr Balnaves said. ""Lisa said, 'oh, as if we haven't been together for the last five days now we've got to be in the house for the next 14'."" But rather than get down about it, they decided to focus on the positives. They had a full pantry thanks to wonderful friends, plenty of gin and tonic and a wardrobe full of costumes.   ""We challenged ourselves to a 14-day costume challenge using only the clothing, costumes and props we have in our apartment,"" Mr Balnaves said. ""They're packed down into vintage suitcases — one for wigs, one for tops, bottoms, shoes, bags."" The trio regularly host dress-up dinner parties for friends. Mr Balnaves also runs an events business, directing boutique gala dinners, conferences and launches, but since the coronavirus crisis all of his work has been cancelled. As boredom and the enormity of the disaster became more apparent, they decided their dress-up challenge was a way to bring some joy to people in a time of doom and gloom.

45,/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-nightcliff-seabreeze-music-festival/12107164,Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival planning to go ahead online amid coronavirus shutdowns,"Organisers of Darwin's Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival say they are planning to transform the multi-stage event by the sea into a virtual gig experience.   Festival production manager Ahva Dub said organisers wanted the event to proceed in some form to support local artists, despite COVID-19 social-gathering restrictions causing a shutdown of the industry. ""From 25,000 [people] down to no public interaction, it's a bit of a turnaround, but you've got to move with the times,"" Mr Dub said. ""Being able to broadcast it [virtually], we can still pay the artists and technical crew from the grant money we've received from the Government. ""It seemed only fair to do our best to put on a good show, in whatever format that could happen in.""     The festival is one of a growing number of events heading online, including the livestreaming of festival Isol-Aid to help combat the more than $300 million in income lost by musicians during Australia's coronavirus shutdown. ""We're giving the artists a chance to get their talents out there still … and bringing it to people at home who might be in isolation,"" Mr Dub said. ""It'll be just like Nightcliff Seabreeze is normally — it gives a sense of togetherness, community … and maybe a bit of a light in the darkness."" Mr Dub said the logistical arrangements for a virtual Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival were still a work in progress, particularly with frequent updates to federal and NT restrictions. ""The ideas have been changing with every announcement from the Prime Minister,"" he said. ""What I say now may change again by the time we get to [the event date on] May 9, but we're already starting to connect with the artists — to find out what they're comfortable doing in the current environment, and what wizardry we can accomplish with technology."" Among these artists is the Garrangali Band from the remote Arnhem Land community of Baniyala, which has been under strict COVID-19 travel and quarantine restrictions. Keyboardist Brendan Marika said the festival's move to an online platform meant bands like his could ""still get a message across"", while protecting their wellbeing. ""Money is one thing, but performing and sharing our music is another,"" Marika said. ""[An online event is] not the same … it's not like you can have the crowd there cheering you on, and enjoying, dancing — but the main thing is getting that message across, and this is finding a way.""       NT singer-songwriter Juran Adams, who performs as Jurxn, said she has had to put much of her career ""on hold"" due to the pandemic, but she appreciated the move to a new platform. ""I'll miss the sense of being with a band and kind of losing myself onstage,"" she said. ""But it's just another opportunity to get recognised, and I'm really grateful.""   Other NT festivals and events, including the Finke Desert Race and Garma Festival, have had to cancel and plan for an uncertain future. NT Tourism Minister Lauren Moss said in the past financial year alone, ""the six events delivered by NT Major Events contributed an economic stimulus of $48 million to the NT economy"". ""We know that the many community events from Glenti to Barunga to the Desert Song Festival are also economically, socially and culturally important to the Territory,"" Ms Moss said.   The NT Government said it had been holding emergency talks with event operators during the coronavirus outbreak. ""The events industry is traditionally an agile sector used to dealing with unexpected circumstances — this resilience will help the sector return once the COVID-19 situation ends,"" Ms Moss said.

46,/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-nightcliff-seabreeze-music-festival/12107164,Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival planning to go ahead online amid coronavirus shutdowns,"Organisers of Darwin's Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival say they are planning to transform the multi-stage event by the sea into a virtual gig experience.   Festival production manager Ahva Dub said organisers wanted the event to proceed in some form to support local artists, despite COVID-19 social-gathering restrictions causing a shutdown of the industry. ""From 25,000 [people] down to no public interaction, it's a bit of a turnaround, but you've got to move with the times,"" Mr Dub said. ""Being able to broadcast it [virtually], we can still pay the artists and technical crew from the grant money we've received from the Government. ""It seemed only fair to do our best to put on a good show, in whatever format that could happen in.""     The festival is one of a growing number of events heading online, including the livestreaming of festival Isol-Aid to help combat the more than $300 million in income lost by musicians during Australia's coronavirus shutdown. ""We're giving the artists a chance to get their talents out there still … and bringing it to people at home who might be in isolation,"" Mr Dub said. ""It'll be just like Nightcliff Seabreeze is normally — it gives a sense of togetherness, community … and maybe a bit of a light in the darkness."" Mr Dub said the logistical arrangements for a virtual Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival were still a work in progress, particularly with frequent updates to federal and NT restrictions. ""The ideas have been changing with every announcement from the Prime Minister,"" he said. ""What I say now may change again by the time we get to [the event date on] May 9, but we're already starting to connect with the artists — to find out what they're comfortable doing in the current environment, and what wizardry we can accomplish with technology."" Among these artists is the Garrangali Band from the remote Arnhem Land community of Baniyala, which has been under strict COVID-19 travel and quarantine restrictions. Keyboardist Brendan Marika said the festival's move to an online platform meant bands like his could ""still get a message across"", while protecting their wellbeing. ""Money is one thing, but performing and sharing our music is another,"" Marika said. ""[An online event is] not the same … it's not like you can have the crowd there cheering you on, and enjoying, dancing — but the main thing is getting that message across, and this is finding a way.""       NT singer-songwriter Juran Adams, who performs as Jurxn, said she has had to put much of her career ""on hold"" due to the pandemic, but she appreciated the move to a new platform. ""I'll miss the sense of being with a band and kind of losing myself onstage,"" she said. ""But it's just another opportunity to get recognised, and I'm really grateful.""   Other NT festivals and events, including the Finke Desert Race and Garma Festival, have had to cancel and plan for an uncertain future. NT Tourism Minister Lauren Moss said in the past financial year alone, ""the six events delivered by NT Major Events contributed an economic stimulus of $48 million to the NT economy"". ""We know that the many community events from Glenti to Barunga to the Desert Song Festival are also economically, socially and culturally important to the Territory,"" Ms Moss said.   The NT Government said it had been holding emergency talks with event operators during the coronavirus outbreak. ""The events industry is traditionally an agile sector used to dealing with unexpected circumstances — this resilience will help the sector return once the COVID-19 situation ends,"" Ms Moss said. ""NT Major Events has been working closely with our event partners on a case-by-case basis to provide the best help possible.""

47,/news/2020-03-31/coronavirus-songs-latest-in-long-history-of-singing-in-disasters/12102164,Coronavirus songs aren't new: Storytelling songs have been adapted through the ages in times of disaster,"Throughout history we have been singing our way through disasters — from the Black Death to coronavirus, lyrics have been adapted to suit the era. English nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and Neil Diamond's recently altered Sweet Caroline, are two examples of how we have used songs to get us through disastrous times. While the initial lyrics of many nursery rhymes may have been more innocent, they were rewritten and adapted over the centuries to reflect the times, accumulating layers of meaning.    Their function was to educate, provide a warning and offer coping mechanisms in recovery, according to James Cook University cultural historian, Chrystopher Spicer. ""Stories have always been passed down from generation to generation, whether it was by song or dance or so-called nursery rhymes,"" Dr Spicer said. ""We're really doing the same thing now when you look at people adapting songs to the current pandemic that's going on.""     Social media feeds have been awash with a multitude of coronavirus-themed song parodies — among them many versions of The Knack's 1979 hit My Sharona, reworked as My Corona— during this pandemic. Many of them communicate important messages of hygiene whilst also poking fun at social restrictions.  Writer, musician, performer and radio broadcaster Casey Bennetto, the author of the award-winning Keating: The Musical, said comedy is often used to ""say the unsayable"". ""Comedy is a useful tool for skirting around things that can't be expressed in any other way — particularly musical comedy,"" he said. One of Bennetto's favourite parodies is Keir Nuttall's controversial COVID-19, which he said was a well-rounded parody, based on the classic song I was only 19 by Redgum. ""It was good writing,"" he said. While many of these songs may not endure though the ages, Bennetto said in the age of social media they served a purpose.   One of the most well-known nursery rhymes, that has gathered meaning throughout history with a multitude of versions in different languages, is Ring a Ring o' Roses, also known as or Ring Around the Rosie.   Although thought to have originated during paganism with more innocent lyrics, Dr Spicer said the lyrics may have been adapted during the Great Plague of London in 1665.  He said the 'rosie' referred to the rash that developed on the skin from the bubonic plague with the 'atishoo atishoo' referring to the transmission via sneezing and 'we all fall down' a reference to the deaths — 15 per cent of Britain's population died.  Dr Spicer also said many earlier versions of nursery rhymes had far darker origins, often filled with brutality with most people only familiar with the printed version of nursery rhymes during the 19th century. ""Which was a great age for sanitising things and for taking those terrible things out,"" he said, which he also found amusing given the brutality of child labour during that era, especially in the coal mine industry.   Execution was the theme of the traditional English nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons, which dates to a 1665 square dance, according to Dr Spicer. Earlier versions had ""and here comes the chopper to chop of your head"". ""A very bloodthirsty last line to it at the end,"" he said. The references to bells refer to the city of London churches that would ring out signalling a public execution. Dr Spicer said each church could be distinguished by the different peal of the bells, helping with navigation around the city. ""So perhaps the rhyme also had an educational value for children, to teach them the bells in order for them not to become lost — kind of a pre-GPS navigating device,"" he said.   In more recent times songs and rhymes have been used as important teaching tools in schools from Australia to the South Pacific. Dr Spicer said there is an interesting cultural attachment to natural disasters in North Queensland because cyclones were regular events there throughout history. ""They are actually part of the seasonal calendar in Queensland, you have the cyclone season in Queensland,"" he said.   With many children traumatised by the effects of the cyclone, one project in Innisfail worked with children helping them express their feelings through song after cyclone Larry. ""[It was designed] to be able to evoke this event that's happened to them,"" Dr Spicer said. Similarly, a disaster risk-management project in the Solomon Islands taught children life-saving skills through songs and rhymes. Dr Spicer said these songs helped not only reduce the fear but were educational.  ","ABC Central Victoria      By Larissa Romensky, Emmie Dowling and Anne-Marie Middlemast","March 31, 2020"

49,/news/2020-03-31/van-gogh-painting-stolen-from-dutch-museum-closed-by-coronavirus/12104954,Van Gogh painting stolen from Dutch museum closed due to coronavirus pandemic,"A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh has been stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, police and the museum have said.   The Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said that The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of Monday (local time). By early afternoon, all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a door in the building's glass facade. Museum general director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is ""angry, shocked, sad"" at the theft. The value of the work, which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, was not immediately known. Van Gogh's paintings, which rarely come up for sale, fetch millions at auction. Police are investigating the theft.   ""I'm shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this has happened,"" Singer Laren museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm said. ""This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen — removed from the community.  ""It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times."" The 25-by-57-centimetre oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background. It dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there, including his famous work The Potato Eaters, in mostly sombre tones.   Later, he moved to southern France, where he developed a far more colourful, vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in 1890. Police said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum.  That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone. A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbours.  Mr van Os said the museum's security worked ""according to protocol"", but he added: ""Obviously we can learn from this."" It is not the first high-profile theft from the museum.  In 2007, thieves stole seven works from its sculpture garden, including a bronze cast of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin.  The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later, missing a leg.
