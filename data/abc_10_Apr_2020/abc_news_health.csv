Here's what you wanted to know","The spread of coronavirus has changed the way we live, as economic, financial and social impacts reverberate across the globe. Many countries have now closed their borders, businesses have shut their doors and hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost their jobs. To help you navigate through this rapidly changing world we asked what you wanted to know about COVID-19. Over the past month we received 45,000 questions which gave an insight into Australia's biggest worries related to the outbreak. Every day, your questions have helped guide our approach to covering the pandemic. Here's what we've learned about you, and the way you're responding to the coronavirus crisis, along with some of the answers we found for you. (And yes, we really did read every single question you sent us.)   Questions flooded in from across the country, and one thing was abundantly clear: Many of you wanted to know what symptoms to look out for, and the next steps to take if you have any of them.    What are the symptoms of coronavirus and are they distinguishable from the usual flu symptoms? – David, WA My partner woke up with a sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, no body aches and a temperature of 36.9 c, what should we do? – Lisa, Vic You wondered why COVID-19 was such a big deal, and you wanted to be sure you knew how to tell the difference between coronavirus and a cold or flu – especially when it comes to those who are most at risk. Why is this outbreak more serious than, say, the common flu that kills hundreds in Australia each year? – Peter, Vic Is everyone susceptible? – Ian, NT You were also quick to ask about the impact on children, babies and pregnant women. I have heard a lot about the virus affecting elderly people and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions, what about pregnant mothers and small children? – Marita, Vic Should we wait to try and make a baby? Is now a bad time to try and make a baby? – Tim, WA Some, like Tim, were thinking about the impact on family planning. While the risks for mothers and babies have been found to be very low, there are no guarantees, so strict prevention measures must still be in place.      We have been told to wash our hands for no less than 20 seconds. What is the best way to dry them? – Janis, Vic Is liquid soap or bar soap more effective in sanitising hands? – Jo We are advised to stop touching our faces. When I am aware of it, I am touching my face because it itches. Why do our faces itch so much? And why do we touch our faces so much? – Magpie, Vic The strong message is to maintain great personal hygiene by washing your hands frequently. Avoid touching your face, sneeze into your elbow, practice social distancing and stay home if you're sick. If you're debating whether to use bar soap or liquid soap like Jo, the answer boils down to technique.  This demonstration by Dr Karl also shows how to wash your hands effectively and how to best dry them. And just for the record Magpie, we don't blame you.  The fact is if it wasn't for coronavirus we'd all be touching our faces approximately 23 times per hour.   Many of you also wanted to know what self-isolation involves and how it applies to travellers. What are the details to self-isolate in Australia? – Joe, SA If any person arrives in Australia from another country, if they live in a different state than where they land, are they free to take another plane home before self-isolating? – Lynette, NT Early in March, the initial advice on self-isolation only applied to those who had returned from high-risk countries, been in contact with someone who had returned from high-risk countries, or been in contact with a confirmed case. But that changed on March 15, when all incoming travellers were told to put on a mask and head straight home upon touchdown then self-isolate for 14 days. On March 28, Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared all international travellers must complete their 14-day isolation period at a state-run quarantine centre in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus, as returning travellers made up more than two-thirds of Australia's cases. So the answer to your question Lynette is that they would need to complete the mandatory isolation before being able to catch a connecting flight back to their home state.   Territorians seemed the most interested in travel as an issue, with questions on the topic accounting for around one-third of their total queries. I have to go home to Darwin driving via Gold Coast ... do I have to isolate in Queensland even if I'm not staying there or can I just pick up car and start driving to Darwin? – James, NT Should we go ahead with our road trip from Darwin to Perth in our caravan? - Wendy, NT If you land in Perth, your home is Darwin, can you fly on a commercial flight to get to your home to self-isolate? If not, how and where do you self-isolate, is accommodation available for these people? - Di Oleary, NT The NT Government made it clear that as long as you cross their borders, self-isolation is mandatory and accommodation won't be free if you're flying in.  You also asked how the NT's strict border rules compared to other parts of the country. A 14-day quarantine is mandatory in Tasmania and South Australia for all non-essential travellers. Western Australia closed its borders at 11.59pm on Sunday. And you can still get into Queensland if you hold a valid border permit. But your travel questions didn't just apply to international or interstate ventures. Many of you asked about the risk of catching the bus or train and whether services would continue to run across the country. While public transport staff are ramping up the cleaning to keep you safe, you also need to do your part by maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing.    How long does the coronavirus survive? Does it survive longer on different surfaces? – Julie, SA If coronavirus can be found on a variety of surfaces, can it be found on dog fur? And if you pat a dog whose owner has coronavirus, can you potentially pick it up? – Katie, NSW I feel like supermarkets would be a virus hotbed, so when I bring my groceries home what should I do? – Robyn, NSW The lifespan of the coronavirus on surfaces was top of your mind, and it even got Katie thinking about whether pets' fur could contribute to the spread. A lot of research is still being done, but veterinarian Jenni Trewren reckons you are safe to keep your furry friends close.   Transmission through food was another concern, so we came up with a guide to help you survive the ordeal of grocery shopping.  Tip: Always be sure to wash your fruit and vegetables before eating them. Can we have a graph of cases over time please? – Bronwyn, Qld Our Digital Story Innovations team built this interactive article to keep you up to date with cases across the country, so, Bronwyn, you can delve into all the numbers and watch as they change over time.   As job losses mounted up quickly after the closure of non-essential businesses, many of you asked about the support measures the Government was putting in place. Some hospitality businesses are still operating, although limited to takeaway services, so you can still support them. The shift in work habits following the advice to work from home where possible sparked a lot of questions. What are the tax options for PAYE employees covering work from home expenses — utilities, council rates, office supplies, phone, internet etc? – Fiona, VIC What is the Government doing for people who have lost their jobs and have rental agreements? – Heather, TAS When it comes to tax, it's good to stay on the safe side and keep a record of your expenses. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has also announced a new tax method that allows you to claim 80 cents per hour on all running expenses.   Those who lost their jobs or saw their hours cut were more interested in knowing what alternatives were in store for them. The Government initially rolled out a stimulus package to provide financial assistance to five major groups, but later extended that help to affected businesses and workers through JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments. If businesses need to lay off staff, can those who have lost their jobs access Centrelink payments instantly to help with rent/food etc.? If so, what is the process? Also, what if you have a mortgage? Are the banks suspending mortgage payments for those who have lost their jobs? – Jo, Vic For those worried about accessing Centrelink for the first time, we took you through the process step-by-step.  And yes, Jo, the big four banks are offering to freeze mortgage payments. As for rent, a moratorium is not entirely off the table for residential tenants while commercial tenants may now have the option to defer payments. Is it safe to walk my dog in the park if I do not go near anybody? – Malcolm, NSW Is it OK to play golf? – Mary-Anne, ACT Can my daughter see her boyfriend? – Donna, WA Am I allowed to take a 20-minute drive to the beach and have a surf? – John, SA You wanted help understanding the new two-person rule imposed on gatherings and how it might affect you, especially when penalties were set. The law stipulates that there are only four acceptable reasons to leave home. However, it does differ slightly between states, including the activities you can and cannot do.  Whatever you're doing, be sure to stay at least 1.5 metres away from others. By the way John, it's a good thing you're in South Australia, because you can still catch a wave there, but with such a rapidly changing rulebook, who's to say things won't be different in the next couple of weeks?

1,/news/2020-04-10/south-australia-concern-people-travel-despite-coronavirus-rules/12140466,Holidaymakers continuing to travel despite coronavirus advice ahead of Easter,"Residents on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula have expressed dismay at the number of holidaymakers continuing to arrive in coastal towns, despite advice not to travel this Easter.   Authorities including the Premier and the Police Commissioner have repeatedly urged people to cancel their long weekend travel plans and not to take unnecessary journeys, to protect the community from the spread of coronavirus. ""This Easter, this school holidays, travel around this state is completely and utterly off. We do not want people heading out,"" Premier Steven Marshall said on Sunday. However, Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns including Port Elliott and Victor Harbor, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, have noticed a rise in travellers.   She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had begun arriving in recent weeks, and the local population was still continuing to swell. ""We've got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we're very concerned,"" Ms Green said. ""Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing — the locals have been talking [about this] on social media."" Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town yesterday, despite the fact local accommodation was closed.   She said while some of them were ratepayers who owned holiday houses in the area, she urged anyone who did not need to be in the area to stay away. ""The shops are just packed and no-one's taking the social-distancing rules into consideration, and it's not fair to us,"" she said. ""It's a bit concerning because we've got such an elderly population here, it's one of the high risk areas. ""We want you to come but just not at the moment.""   Coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in South Australia and there have been 421 confirmed cases. ""At the locations people tend to holiday we'll be out in force. We'll have police horses, we'll be using the police helicopter, the police plane, and also drones to monitor areas where we believe crowds are likely to gather,"" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. ""We've also been in touch with most holiday camps and caravan parks. ""People are not welcome in those areas and some shops are refusing to serve people who do not reside in those areas."" Extra police will monitor border control points, ""limiting the opportunity for people to visit those well-known holiday areas"".   Police yesterday confirmed eleven people had been fined after a house party in Port Augusta on Tuesday night, after the group repeatedly ignored directives from officers. ""The crowd were forcibly dispersed,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""We are prepared to show some tolerance … but where this is a blatant disregard for those warnings, we will take action.""     The Commissioner also warned people who spit or deliberately cough to scare others on public transport could be committing an offence. It follows anecdotal reports of people intentionally coughing near drivers or other passengers to cause distress. ""Any action like that, that is done to cause fear of infection may well constitute a criminal offence,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""If those matters are reported and we're able to identify those people we will take action. This is an abhorrent act.""      ",,"April 10, 2020"

3,/news/2020-04-10/adf-plane-to-deliver-relief-to-vanuatu-after-cyclone-harold/12140456,Australian aid to help Cyclone Harold relief efforts as COVID-19 frustrates response,"An Australian Defence Force (ADF) plane will head to Vanuatu within days to deliver relief supplies to the small Pacific nation after it was devastated by this week's Cyclone Harold.   The week-long storm has destroyed homes, cut off power and killed dozens in four Pacific island countries. Local disaster teams in Vanuatu hope to reach some of the worst-affected areas today. Glen Craig from the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council estimates up to 90 per cent of homes in the country's second largest town, Luganville, have been damaged. ""It's worse than what we thought,"" he said. ""People here are positive. I think they're still a bit shell-shocked at the moment but they know that help is coming but help will need to come fast. ""Hopefully Australia and New Zealand military, especially, can start to mobilise — the airfield's fine for landing heavy aircraft.""   Aid groups predict Vanuatu's recovery could take more than 12 months. The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"", with fears the damage in some places has been worse than Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million — more than half of the country's annual GDP. Kendra Gates Derousseau, the country director at World Vision in Vanuatu, told the ABC damage she had seen in Luganville and video of Pentecost Island, ""indicate that the damage is significantly worse than tropical Cyclone Pam"". ""The body of Harold was smaller than Pam, so the damage is less expansive in terms of numbers of islands, but the islands that were hit — it almost looked like a tornado had ripped through Luganville,"" she said. ""Instead of things being wind-blown and toppled, they were literally torn to pieces.""    The ADF will deliver relief supplies such as blankets, lanterns, shelter and hygiene kits. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the assistance for Vanuatu was ""part of our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder during times of crisis."" Foreign Minister Marise Payne said there would likely be more assistance announced in the coming days. ""We are acutely conscious that this comes on top of the impact and difficulties created by COVID-19 for those countries and so our support is all the more important,"" Senator Payne said. New Zealand announced on Wednesday it would provide $480,000 to Vanuatu to help rebuild after the cyclone. According to Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, however, ""no foreign personnel are being brought to Vanuatu for response efforts at the present time"". ""This will be an internally run operation,"" it said. Any crew unloading supplies would wear protective gear and remain on the runway, authorities said.   The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, severely damaged tourist resorts in Tonga yesterday.   Local police reported three tourist resorts north of the capital, Nukualofa, had been virtually flattened. Damage caused by Harold in Fiji, meanwhile, was worse than anticipated, the Red Cross told the ABC. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said the country was ""hit hard"" but that he was ""still waiting for the full damage report"". Flooding caused by the cyclone continues to affect much of the country. A tornado flipped the roof off a local college, Mr Bainimarama said in a message posted to Twitter. ""We've been through many cyclones before, even stronger than Harold. We always bounce back."" At least 27 people were killed in the Solomon Islands during the storm after they were swept off a ferry. Australia has already provided support to the Solomon Islands and has offered assistance to Fiji and Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide further help to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" Senator Payne said. ""It will be some time before the full impact of this disaster is known.""   Pacific nations have implemented measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite having relatively few reported cases.   While Vanuatu has not confirmed any cases of COVID-19, there are concerns the relief effort could compromise the vulnerable nation.  ""Foreign-donated humanitarian supplies, which have initially come from our partners from Australia, New Zealand and France, are being handled to strict health protocols to negate any risk of COVID-19 coming to Vanuatu,"" a statement said. Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu had no intensive care beds and that if coronavirus hit, ""it would have the potential to devastate the population"".   Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Wednesday agreed to establish a Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19, which it said would allow for assistance to be expedited and distributed equitably among member countries. Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, said coronavirus ""poses a real and extreme danger to the health and security of the Pacific peoples"". ""Never before has the full forum membership simultaneously been in crisis.""   The European Union, meanwhile, announced 119 million euros ($205 million) to assist Pacific nations to strengthen their health, water and sanitation systems in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ''The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge of our time,"" EU ambassador for the Pacific, H.E. Sujiro Seam, said.   Fijian authorities have urged parents to keep their children indoors. ""Even though the cyclone has passed, the threat of floods is still present and we still need you to stay home because of COVID-19"", a statement said. Observers fear cyclone relief efforts will be further compounded by the economic consequences of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Ms Gates Derousseau said tourism was 40 per cent of Vanuatu's budget, and was ""unlikely to come back anytime soon"". Australian National University development economist Christopher Hoy told the ABC countries in the region such as Tonga and Samoa were already suffering from severe debt distress.",Pacific Beat      By Max Walden and Catherine Graue,"April 10, 2020"

9,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"

11,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader.

13,/news/2020-04-10/saudi-led-ceasefire-in-yemen-amid-coronavirus-hopes-for-peace/12140410,Saudi-led ceasefire in Yemen begins after UN calls for stop in fighting amid coronavirus pandemic,"A ceasefire declared by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen has come into effect, potentially paving the way for peace talks to end the five-year-old war that has pushed millions to the brink of famine.   Saudi officials said late on Wednesday the ceasefire would last for two weeks, adding the move was in response to UN calls to halt hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yemen has not reported any confirmed cases of COVID-19, but experts warn an outbreak could be catastrophic for the war-torn country whose healthcare system has been largely decimated by the conflict.   On Wednesday, Houthi rebels sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war, Reuters reported. But on Thursday, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti dismissed the Saudi offer as a ploy by the kingdom to boost its international standing, while a spokesman for the rebel forces accused the coalition of several attacks after the ceasefire began.   ""This announcement does not express a genuine intention to achieve peace,"" Mr Bukhaiti said. ""The Saudis are still employing their air, land and naval forces to tighten the siege on Yemen … this is an announcement only to restore [their positions], to close ranks.""   Saudi Deputy Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted on Thursday that the ceasefire ""will hopefully create a more effective climate to de-escalate tensions"" and enable the sides to work towards a political settlement.  He also said Saudi Arabia would contribute $US500 million ($790 million) to UN relief efforts in Yemen this year, and an additional $US25 million ($40 million) to combat the pandemic. ""It is up to the Houthis to put the health and safety of the Yemeni people above all else,"" the Prince wrote. The war in Yemen has killed more than 100,000 people and many civilians welcomed the ceasefire.   ""We are tired of the war,"" said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden. ""If the war hasn't already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease."" Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the truce could be extended to allow warring parties to discuss ""a comprehensive political solution in Yemen"". He said the coalition hoped for three-way peace talks in which the Houthis, the UN-backed government of Yemeni President Abed Rabo Mansour Hadi, and a military team from the coalition would sit down to negotiate a durable settlement. In a statement, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis to engage ""in good faith and without preconditions"" in the talks to agree on a nationwide truce mechanism.   UN and international aid agencies warned that an outbreak of the new coronavirus in Yemen could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on a population with degraded immunity and war-weakened health infrastructure.

14,/news/2020-04-10/saudi-led-ceasefire-in-yemen-amid-coronavirus-hopes-for-peace/12140410,Saudi-led ceasefire in Yemen begins after UN calls for stop in fighting amid coronavirus pandemic,"A ceasefire declared by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen has come into effect, potentially paving the way for peace talks to end the five-year-old war that has pushed millions to the brink of famine.   Saudi officials said late on Wednesday the ceasefire would last for two weeks, adding the move was in response to UN calls to halt hostilities amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yemen has not reported any confirmed cases of COVID-19, but experts warn an outbreak could be catastrophic for the war-torn country whose healthcare system has been largely decimated by the conflict.   On Wednesday, Houthi rebels sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war, Reuters reported. But on Thursday, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti dismissed the Saudi offer as a ploy by the kingdom to boost its international standing, while a spokesman for the rebel forces accused the coalition of several attacks after the ceasefire began.   ""This announcement does not express a genuine intention to achieve peace,"" Mr Bukhaiti said. ""The Saudis are still employing their air, land and naval forces to tighten the siege on Yemen … this is an announcement only to restore [their positions], to close ranks.""   Saudi Deputy Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted on Thursday that the ceasefire ""will hopefully create a more effective climate to de-escalate tensions"" and enable the sides to work towards a political settlement.  He also said Saudi Arabia would contribute $US500 million ($790 million) to UN relief efforts in Yemen this year, and an additional $US25 million ($40 million) to combat the pandemic. ""It is up to the Houthis to put the health and safety of the Yemeni people above all else,"" the Prince wrote. The war in Yemen has killed more than 100,000 people and many civilians welcomed the ceasefire.   ""We are tired of the war,"" said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden. ""If the war hasn't already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease."" Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the truce could be extended to allow warring parties to discuss ""a comprehensive political solution in Yemen"". He said the coalition hoped for three-way peace talks in which the Houthis, the UN-backed government of Yemeni President Abed Rabo Mansour Hadi, and a military team from the coalition would sit down to negotiate a durable settlement. In a statement, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres urged the Saudi-backed government and the Houthis to engage ""in good faith and without preconditions"" in the talks to agree on a nationwide truce mechanism.   UN and international aid agencies warned that an outbreak of the new coronavirus in Yemen could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on a population with degraded immunity and war-weakened health infrastructure. ""After five years of war, vulnerabilities are high and immunities are low across the population as a whole,"" UN humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said from Sanaa on Thursday.

The number of confirmed cases in the state is now 1,241 after 13 more cases were confirmed overnight. There are now 158 healthcare workers who have contracted the virus, one more than yesterday. There are 43 people in hospital, seven more than yesterday, and 13 people are in intensive care. Another 120 people have recovered from the disease, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 926. Police have issued another 98 fines in the past 24 hours to people flouting stage three restrictions, and carried out 754 checks on people who should be in self-isolation.   Elsewhere in the country, a 69-year-old man died from coronavirus complications overnight in New South Wales, bringing the national death toll to 53. The rise in the national death toll comes as 280 Australians have arrived in Melbourne after leaving a number of locations in Peru. They immediately boarded buses and were taken to hotels in the city for two weeks of self-isolation. More Australians stuck in Peru, Argentina and South Africa are expected to be brought home over the next week. The figures come as the Minister for Prevention of Family Violence Gabrielle Williams announced the State Government would invest $40.2 million in crisis accommodation and specialist services for people suffering or at risk of family violence.   The Government will put $20 million towards short-term accommodation for people who do not feel safe isolating or recovering from COVID-19 at home. Another $20.2 million will help family violence services meet the expected increase in demand during the health crisis. The package will include about $5 million for technology and protective equipment and targeted funding will be provided to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. The Government has also announced a plan to help Victorians experiencing homelessness who need to self-isolate. Housing Minister Richard Wynne has announced $8 million will be put towards using decommissioned aged-care homes at four Melbourne locations to house 200 people sleeping rough, and provide them with healthcare.   To be eligible for the program, people must either be waiting on test results, have a positive coronavirus diagnosis, be required to self-isolate but have nowhere to do so, or have been discharged from hospital and require accommodation to recover. ""People without secure accommodation are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they can't self-isolate or quarantine, this will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus,'' Mr Wynne said.   The housing will be operated by Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria with outreach staff providing 24-hour support. Mr Wynne also said public housing tenants' rent assessments would not be affected by any Federal Government financial stimulus payments over the coming months.   As the country gears up for a different kind of Easter, authorities around Australia are pleading with people to remain at home and not travel to regional or coastal areas this weekend. On Thursday, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville said police would be checking on travellers on roads and in tourist hotspots to make sure they were complying with coronavirus restrictions. State MP for South Barwon  Darren Cheeseman has called for Surf Coast Shire Council to close all beaches this weekend to deter people from travelling to the coast. ""They should be closed to all activity, including surfing, swimming, fishing, walking, and sunbathing,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Meanwhile, Victorian emergency departments have reported a 20 per cent drop in patients with injuries as the state's stage three lockdown continues. The Department of Health said there had been a reduction from an average of 5,000 patients per day to 4,100 per day. But while there had been an overall drop in the number of people presenting to emergency departments, some areas have seen an unexpected spike during the lockdown.   Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had received ""an influx of patients with severe burns"" from home cooking and barbecuing. ""If you are going to be cooking, please pay attention,"" she said. ""And if you're going to be barbecuing, please, please do not throw accelerants like methylated spirits or petrol onto the fire to try and get it going."" However, hospitals and medical professionals have expressed concern that emergency department numbers might be down because people were delaying vital treatment.   Stroke Foundation chief executive Sharon McGowan said some patients who were worried about being a burden on the health system or contracting COVID-19 at a hospital were not seeking help when they needed it. ""We've already heard from our clinicians on the ground of two cases where individuals with the early signs of stroke actually delayed calling triple zero,"" Ms McGowan said. Ambulance services across Victoria have also seen a 20 per cent drop in emergency calls prompting Ms McGowan to urge Australians not to play down medical emergencies during the pandemic.

Children, restless and ready to arrive, can taste two weeks of school holiday freedom. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" come the eager cries from the back seat. But the road we are on this Easter — as families, friends, as individuals and as a state — is a road to nowhere. Stuck at home, ordered to stay inside where possible, gathering outside only groups of two, it is an Easter like no other. And it is one in which the road to a post-pandemic normal seems to be vanishing in the distance.   The journey to where recovery begins, to where we can once again enjoy life's simple pleasures, even a Sunday lunch at a long family table, has only just begun. Almost a month into Australia's dramatic hard-line response to the coronavirus outbreak, people are wondering when that moment will come. And it is not only the children asking: ""Are we there yet?"" The answer from the state's leaders is sadly and simply: ""No"". We are not even close. If this is a marathon, the starting gun has only just been fired. WA Premier Mark McGowan this week again likened the coronavirus crisis to fighting a war. ""We've only just started our battle here in Western Australia,"" Mr McGowan said. ""The months ahead are going to be hard. They are going to be frustrating, tedious and at times even boring. ""It will test us all, but this is going to be one of the hardest things many of us will ever do.""   The State Government has moved quickly to implement what it acknowledges are extreme measures as it grapples with the crisis.   It closed WA's borders last Sunday night, effectively rendering the state an ""island within an island"". Now, only those with exemptions to that rule are allowed in. There is also no travel allowed between the state's vast regions. Those measures and countless others, some which have had devastating consequences for local business, industry and employment, have helped ""flatten the curve"". It is a nation–wide approach to slow the spread of the virus and ease the pressure on the health system, to ensure it is in the best position to care for those who do get sick. In WA, the rate of infection has remained relatively low. Six people have so far died. There are 495 diagnosed cases, although the number of new reported infections eased significantly last week. But it is important to keep in mind the criteria for those who can be tested has been quite restricted to date. That testing regime expanded on Thursday, so more results may start to reveal just how far the virus may have spread in the state.   The State Government has been encouraged by the low rates of infection, but its message was clear this week: The virus is still out there. There is no room for complacency. ""We need to keep on doing what we are doing,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Even though the numbers in WA are promising we all know just how serious this virus is. The harsh and sad reality is we will continue to lose West Australians to the virus. ""So we have no reason to get complacent now."" The State Government is pleased with the public's response to the changes, with a majority adopting and adapting quickly to the restrictions in place. But with businesses shuttered and livelihoods either lost or threatened, people across the community are wondering just how long life will be like this.   ""It's early days, these are early days and we're not going to see a quick fix for this,"" warned Health Minister Roger Cook. And Mr McGowan repeated his message that people should expect it to be the reality for six months. ""I am afraid that's the message,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Look forward to a hard, long six months.""   He said if a vaccine, or what he referred to as a ""holy grail"", was developed that timeframe would obviously change. But there is no guarantee of when, or even if, a vaccine will be available to protect the population from COVID-19 Mr McGowan knows his challenge going forward will be to keep the public's goodwill intact over the long term. ""I just hope that in a month or two … people understand that it has to continue on,"" he said. The State Government must continue to manage the delicate balance between lives and livelihoods over that time. It will need to make constant assessments about if and when restrictions can be eased over the coming months, while facing certain calls from business and industry to release the pressure. It is what one international expert explains as the three-way tug of war — ""combating disease, protecting economy and keeping society on an even keel"". Another infectious disease expert, Michael Osterholm, told the ABC's 7.30 this week a middle ground needed to be found where younger people, who were less at risk, could start to be incorporated back into everyday life. ""And then when we have evidence the virus is not circulating widely, we surely let other members of our society make the decisions for themselves,"" he said. ""And then as soon as we see that virus activity picking up immediately, we do the shelter in place again and try to squelch it.""   An expert closer to home — Executive Dean of UWA's Health and Medical Sciences Faculty Professor Jon Watson — said the forecast six-month time frame was realistic. But he believes some restrictions could be eased over the months to come. ""Gradually people will, if the curve continues to flatten, there will be requests from business and industry and tech and science and export industries, to start to relax the quite significant restrictions we have at the moment,"" Professor Watson said. But his prediction is that the 'island within an island' policy may be the last to go.   ""My sense is maybe WA will open internally for business before it opens to the other states, and then the third step will be opening internationally,"" Professor Watson said. The Premier himself is wary of making any predictions about when that might be a possibility. But he said restrictions would be reviewed monthly and amended where possible.

19,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-lessons-we-can-learn-from-history/12134044,Coronavirus lessons we can learn from other dark times in history,"""One thing I've learned in life is, money can be a very lonely companion. Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.

Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said.

20,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-lessons-we-can-learn-from-history/12134044,Coronavirus lessons we can learn from other dark times in history,"""One thing I've learned in life is, money can be a very lonely companion. Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.   ""Far from people staying at home, they were being drawn out,"" he said. ""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last?

Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.

25,/news/2020-04-10/flu-season-with-coronavirus-could-mean-extended-lockdown-covid19/12136870,A winter flu season means Australia's coronavirus lockdown could last for months,"Leading health experts believe the looming flu season means Australia's tough social-distancing laws will not be lifted for several months, despite the NSW Government considering easing of restrictions in May.   On Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said some restrictions on travel and personal contact would be reassessed every month. The number of COVID-19 infections has declined, but experts warned lifting the lockdown could spark an influenza outbreak. Last year in Australia, 812 people died from the flu. Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza said an influenza outbreak would further strain hospitals.   He warned schools, childcare centres and nursing homes were places influenza could spread quickly. ""If schools are fully opened again, we could see influenza spread back through schools and into the community,"" Professor Barr said. ""Similarly this could happen in aged care homes, which are currently in lockdown mode with reduced visits.""   Epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws, an advisor to WHO on the coronavirus crisis, said the threat of an influenza outbreak meant ""we are fighting a war on many fronts"". ""An influenza pandemic would not only put a surge of stress on GPs and hospitals, but it would cause a problem for rational testing of COVID-19,"" she said. Both viruses shared identical symptoms and would create a need for fairly healthy patients to be put through a battery of tests. She said the flood of tests would frustrate the real-time collection of coronavirus data and would delay any decision to end lockdowns. Levels of Influenza A — the most contagious and deadly type of flu — spiked in February and three serious outbreaks in aged care facilities took NSW Health authorities by surprise.   Any spread of Influenza A is tracked carefully by authorities and is the centre of global pandemics which kills millions of people every year. The Federal Government purchased a record 13.5 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines, at the coast of $80 million, to ensure free doses were widely available in 2020.   But Professor McLaws said it was not enough and that all 24.7 million Australians must be covered. ""You need 95 per cent of the population to get herd immunity,"" she said. ""We need to ramp up drive-in flu clinics to get the coverage we need."" The Australian Medical Association urged all Australian's to help prevent influenza spreading by scheduling a flu vaccination with their doctor. Kean Sing-Lim, president of AMA NSW, believed the winter flu preparations showed Australia was ""not out of harm's way"". He said evidence from the coronavirus outbreaks in Italy and China proved lockdowns needed to be enforced for several months to be effective. ""It's difficult to predict the severity of flu seasons ahead of time — we have to plan for the worst,"" he said.   A NSW Health spokesperson acknowledged the tough approach on coronavirus was ""effective prevention against influenza"" but would not speculate on future lockdown plans.  They said the Government was offering free flu vaccines to people over 65, young children, pregnant women, and Indigenous people through GPs. Dr Sing-Lim said physical-distancing laws in Australia were so far slowing the spread of infection. Yesterday, there were 2,733 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW with 39 news cases added to the tally — the lowest daily count in the state since March 16.

27,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-claiming-tax-rent-mortgage/12135048,Coronavirus is changing how we claim tax this year. But what about rent or mortgage?,"If your office is now at home, you may be wondering: does this mean I can claim my rent or mortgage at tax time? In an effort to get you through uncharted waters, we recently published this piece on what you can claim when working from home. With many of us now sharing our work space with our kids, our cats and our dirty dishes, the ATO has introduced a new, simpler method for people to make claims at tax time. It's an 80-cents-per-hour method, which includes all running expenses like the phone, power bills, heating and cooling. But many of you sent through some questions about particular household items. You were worried that if you claimed any home office expenses now that you might have to pay more tax when it comes time to sell your property. So we went back to our experts to find out.   So now that your work space and living space has combined, can you also claim your rent or the interest on your mortgage? Well, it's complicated. But in general, no.   That's because in most cases, your house isn't the main office, studio or place of business, says Andrew Gardiner, spokesperson for the National Tax and Accountants' Association. ""This is the case even though you might be highly encouraged or forced to work from home when dealing with the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. The main exception is if you legitimately run your small business from a dedicated space in your home or your employer does not provide you with an office or work station at their business premises. ""The classic example would be someone who runs a hairdressing salon out of part of their house and they have it dedicated for that purpose,"" Mr Gardiner said. But even then, you can't claim your total rent or the full amount of your interest on your mortgage. You can still only claim a portion, worked out by calculating the floor area of the business space compared to the total property size. Many people sent questions into us, worried that if they made any home office claims, they might get a sting in the tail when it comes time to sell their home — meaning they might have to pay capital gains tax.   Capital gains tax is basically a tax that you pay to the Government when you make a profit on an investment — usually a property or shares. You don't usually have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the home that you live in — it's called the main residence exemption. Fortunately, even if you make claims for home office expenses like the internet, phone, heating and cooling, you won't have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the family home, tax accountant Paula Hart says. ""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat.

""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat. But, of course, if you're still confused, make sure you check with your accountant.     This article contains general information only. It should not be relied on as financial advice.

29,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482,"What causes a 'second wave' outbreak of coronavirus, and could we see this in Australia?","Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing. However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection. As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.     Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one. If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away. When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity. If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.   Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection. Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last. The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely. As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.   A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission. If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave. When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.   Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate. Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection. In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound. We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave. However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19. Australia's current efforts are focused on ""flattening the curve"" of the first wave of COVID-19. Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising. But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave. And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward. We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

Intrastate border restrictions are in place in WA, separating each of the state's nine region's from Perth, and West Australians have repeatedly been told not to travel to holiday homes or away from their primary place of residence. Fyfe drew the attention of Margaret River locals when he pulled into a beach car park at Gas Bay on Friday morning. The ABC approached the 28-year-old for comment as he walked back to a car after his surf but he declined, asking instead that his privacy be respected.   Subsequent calls were then placed to Fremantle Dockers management and Fyfe's personal manager, Jason Dover, but neither was prepared to offer comment other than to say he was driving trucks for his father, picking up a delivery of lime in Margaret River. Dockers Media manager Luke Morfesse said Fyfe was simply taking the opportunity to surf in lieu of exercise. At a media conference on Thursday afternoon, WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson confirmed police were investigating the incident. But after reviewing the matter, police released a statement on Thursday night clearing Fyfe of any wrongdoing.   ""It has been confirmed that Mr Fyfe entered the region in order to provide transport services and was waiting for a truck to be loaded when he went surfing,"" the statement said. ""As a result, Mr Fyfe had a valid exemption and was compliant with directions regarding regional travel.   ""It has further been established that Mr Fyfe did not breach social distancing requirements. ""The intent of the directions is to reduce travel in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Western Australia. ""Exemptions for regional travel do apply, but exempt travellers must only travel as required and must only stay in the region for as long as it takes to complete the essential service."" Commissioner Chris Dawson said the interpretation of the law had been examined and it had been determined that Fyfe did not commit any breaches.   ""The spirit of the law is that people apply common sense and only move to another region for the purposes of performing an essential service,"" Mr Dawson said. ""I will change my directions if I learn of people's behaviours putting others at risk. Fyfe was photographed with the captain of the Australian hockey team Aran Zalewski.

37,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-poverty-study-research-oxfam-anu/12136222,"Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty by coronavirus economic fallout, study finds","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy could see as many as 580 million people — 8 per cent of the world's population — pushed into poverty, according to researchers.   Aid groups, meanwhile, are calling on rich countries to cancel foreign debt held by developing nations in light of projections that decades of poverty alleviation efforts could be lost. A paper released by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research projects that if consumption contracts in developing countries by 20 per cent, it could see an increase in poverty for 400 to 600 million people globally. ""We were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow COVID-19 in developing countries,"" said Professor Andy Sumner, one of the lead authors from King's College London.   ""Our findings point towards the importance of a dramatic expansion of social safety nets in developing countries as soon as possible and — more broadly — much greater attention to the impact of COVID in developing countries and what the international community can do to help.""   ""Even under our most conservative scenario, too conservative to be realistic … we're still talking about 100 million extra people [falling] into extreme poverty,"" said Christopher Hoy of the Australian National University, another author of the report.   In the Middle East and North Africa, he said, it was ""very possible"" that poverty rates could return to what they were in 1990. The research was released as scientists said they were concerned a new wave of coronavirus would spread across Asia. Humanitarian workers have warned that the pandemic could prove devastating in much of Asia and the Pacific, due to widespread poverty, crowded living conditions and weak healthcare systems. CARE Australia fears a ""nightmare scenario"" if the disease takes hold in Papua New Guinea and Australia's other Pacific neighbours.   In Indonesia — the world's fourth most populous nation — projections have shown up to 240,000 people could die  if no control measures were taken. Mr Hoy warned ""the economic crisis was potentially going to be even more severe than the health crisis"". ""In Indonesia, for example, extreme poverty is quite low but a lot of people are just above the extreme poverty line,"" he told the ABC.    ""In our moderate scenario we'd expect to see a 50 per cent increase in the people living in extreme poverty. Under our extreme scenario it would more than double."" Lyn Morgain, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said that while a number of countries in South-East Asia had technically reached middle income status, it obscured the fact that development was uneven and that there continued to be ""profound and deep poverty in many of those nation states"".   Successive Australian governments have cut aid to South-East Asia and South Asia, in favour of funding programs in the Pacific.  Ms Morgain said that there was ""greater utility"" in a broader regional approach focused on Asia as well as the Pacific nations, especially during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not something we would regard as simply a favour to others. Our region has great strength and capability,"" she said. The ABC asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Australia's assistance to the region, but had not received a response at the time of publication.  Last month, the United Nations unveiled a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan and urged members of the G20, including Australia, to contribute to helping developing countries weather the economic storm caused by coronavirus. ""The only way for Australia to have a safe and prosperous future, is if Australia is in a safe and prosperous region,"" Mr Hoy said.

38,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-poverty-study-research-oxfam-anu/12136222,"Half a billion people could be pushed into poverty by coronavirus economic fallout, study finds","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy could see as many as 580 million people — 8 per cent of the world's population — pushed into poverty, according to researchers.   Aid groups, meanwhile, are calling on rich countries to cancel foreign debt held by developing nations in light of projections that decades of poverty alleviation efforts could be lost. A paper released by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research projects that if consumption contracts in developing countries by 20 per cent, it could see an increase in poverty for 400 to 600 million people globally. ""We were surprised at the sheer scale of the potential poverty tsunami that could follow COVID-19 in developing countries,"" said Professor Andy Sumner, one of the lead authors from King's College London.   ""Our findings point towards the importance of a dramatic expansion of social safety nets in developing countries as soon as possible and — more broadly — much greater attention to the impact of COVID in developing countries and what the international community can do to help.""   ""Even under our most conservative scenario, too conservative to be realistic … we're still talking about 100 million extra people [falling] into extreme poverty,"" said Christopher Hoy of the Australian National University, another author of the report.   In the Middle East and North Africa, he said, it was ""very possible"" that poverty rates could return to what they were in 1990. The research was released as scientists said they were concerned a new wave of coronavirus would spread across Asia. Humanitarian workers have warned that the pandemic could prove devastating in much of Asia and the Pacific, due to widespread poverty, crowded living conditions and weak healthcare systems. CARE Australia fears a ""nightmare scenario"" if the disease takes hold in Papua New Guinea and Australia's other Pacific neighbours.   In Indonesia — the world's fourth most populous nation — projections have shown up to 240,000 people could die  if no control measures were taken. Mr Hoy warned ""the economic crisis was potentially going to be even more severe than the health crisis"". ""In Indonesia, for example, extreme poverty is quite low but a lot of people are just above the extreme poverty line,"" he told the ABC.    ""In our moderate scenario we'd expect to see a 50 per cent increase in the people living in extreme poverty. Under our extreme scenario it would more than double."" Lyn Morgain, the chief executive of Oxfam Australia, said that while a number of countries in South-East Asia had technically reached middle income status, it obscured the fact that development was uneven and that there continued to be ""profound and deep poverty in many of those nation states"".   Successive Australian governments have cut aid to South-East Asia and South Asia, in favour of funding programs in the Pacific.  Ms Morgain said that there was ""greater utility"" in a broader regional approach focused on Asia as well as the Pacific nations, especially during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's not something we would regard as simply a favour to others. Our region has great strength and capability,"" she said. The ABC asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about Australia's assistance to the region, but had not received a response at the time of publication.  Last month, the United Nations unveiled a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan and urged members of the G20, including Australia, to contribute to helping developing countries weather the economic storm caused by coronavirus. ""The only way for Australia to have a safe and prosperous future, is if Australia is in a safe and prosperous region,"" Mr Hoy said. The World Bank has predicted a global recession and estimated recently that nearly 24 million fewer people would escape poverty across the Asia Pacific in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic.

The lockdown, implemented on March 22, has resulted in a ""significant improvement in air quality in the country"", as revealed by data analysis from India's Central Pollution Control Board. The report showed air quality in 85 cities had improved significantly as most vehicles remained off roads and non-essential businesses closed.  The report said: ""Data shows that on average, Indian cities had an AQI [Air Quality Index] of 115 between March 16 and 24."" ""The air quality started showing improvements from the first day of the 21-day lockdown. The average AQI fell to 75 in the first three days of the lockdown.""   Dozens of residents from the Jalandhar district in Punjab took to social media to share crystal-clear views of the snow-capped mountains, thanking the improved air quality for the awe-inspiring snaps. The mountain range is the world's highest with elevations of more than 8,000 metres, and includes the world's tallest peak, Mount Everest.   Some residents claimed it was the first time they had seen the peaks.   According to the latest figures from India's health ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has passed the 4,000 mark with more than 100 people dead so far. India has a population of around 1.3 billion people, with one of the world's most polluted cities, according to IQ Air pollution researchers. Ghaziabad, an area close to New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, had been ranked as the world's most polluted, with an average PM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019.  The microscopic particles, known as PM 2.5, are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, and are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system of a human.   Air pollution over China also plummeted in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to NASA. NASA and the European Space Agency's pollution monitoring satellites detected a significant decline in the amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over China since the lockdown. ""There is evidence that the change is at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus,"" NASA said in a statement.

Perth has seen hundreds of cruise ship passengers quarantined in hotels across the city. On Wednesday it emerged that pleas for emergency help by two passengers — Kathleen and Kenny Watson, who were staying at Perth's Crown Promenade hotel — went unanswered for hours and that an ambulance that was called for them was turned away. Mr Watson, 70, has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and is now in a coma in hospital.   The case has prompted an urgent investigation by WA Health authorities and the doctor who was charged with looking after the Watsons while in hotel quarantine has had her contract terminated by Healthcare Australia. But the doctor, who asked not to be identified, has revealed to ABC Radio Perth the enormous obstacles she faced in caring for hundreds of passengers across two hotels while dealing with a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). She criticised the WA Health Department for ""throwing her under a bus"". ""They are making me the scapegoat for their incompetency,"" she said.   The GP said she was given one to two hours' notice by a recruitment agency to turn up at the Crown hotels last Monday. ""I basically realised only when I arrived on site that I was one doctor, with one nurse, and had been put in charge of 600 guests — 300 at the Crown Prom and 300 at the Crown Metropol,"" she said. ""I wasn't given any guidelines, or protocols, procedures — there was no PPE, there was actually nothing. ""I just turned up to the hotel and it was sort of like 'well what do I do next?' and they said 'well you go and figure it out'.""   Referring to Mr and Mrs Watson, the doctor said the initial message she received was that Mr Watson was ""just a little malnourished"" and she did not feel that he should be at the top of her priority list.   When the couple could not get any help for several hours their daughter in Sydney called an ambulance, but it was turned away when it reached the hotel. The doctor said this happened because she was told by a paramedic who went to the couple's room that they were not a medical emergency. She said she did not inspect the situation for herself because she had no PPE.   ""The problem is that we still hadn't been receiving the PPE that the Health Department had been promising us, so I couldn't really do anything more than what the paramedic had done and stand across the corridor,"" the doctor said. ""I would have had to don the full PPE to go into the room to make some sort of more direct assessment. ""I had my hands tied behind my back in terms of doing any further examination. ""I said perhaps this is just, you know, that everyone is getting upset and angry that they are up here in the Crown like everyone else … I'll deal with him, I'll come back and have a look at him, but there are so many other cases that I have got."" It wasn't until the doctor received a phone call from a medical practitioner who had been on the couple's cruise ship, the Costa Luminosa, filling her in on Mr Watson's medical history and poor health during the trip that she decided to call another ambulance. ""When I heard this story, I was like: 'What! This is really bad and I better call the ambulance right now.'"" WA Health said it had requested Healthcare Australia make changes to their rostered personnel, saying the organisation ""was not meeting the expectations of the state"". The doctor concerned said she was told on Sunday afternoon not to return to the Crown hotels.   But, she said the department had to take responsibility for the lack of staff and PPE. ""In a hospital, you would have one doctor in a ward with about 20 to 30 patients at most,"" she said. ""But that one doctor is also supported by a team of other doctors and nursing staff."" The doctor also provided an insight into the process for passengers with health concerns at the Crown hotels at the time she was working there. She said guests would ring a guest services number which went to a Crown hotel call centre in Melbourne and that this would be redirected back to the hotel's reception where staff would write down the details on a post-it note and give it to a nurse. WA Health told ABC Radio Perth they were investigating the incident ""as a priority"". This included reviewing the nursing and medical support for about 2,000 guests at seven hotels across Perth and almost 200 people on Rottnest Island to ensure they had the very best access to care.   ""It is the responsibility of Healthcare Australia to determine the staffing ratio of rostered nurses and doctors required to meet the needs of people in quarantine at Crown,"" a statement said. ""It is important to note that the people inside quarantine at Crown are not hospital patients — if they require clinical care then they are transferred to hospital."" WA Health said PPE was always available at Crown and was restocked as necessary. Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said the doctor's claims about a lack of PPE should not be dismissed. ""We know it has been very short in lots of places so it would be surprising to us if the Crown hotel was the one place in Perth that had a good supply of PPE,"" Dr Miller said.   ""She's a doctor of impeccable reputation and long experience so I think that her claims need to be taken seriously and fully investigated, and not just batted away. ""The position the doctor was put in, I think, was unreasonable. ""Above all, we need to ensure that these people are being properly looked after. ""If they are being forced into quarantine by the community then the Government needs to provide them with adequate supervision and medical care."" Mrs Watson was released from Royal Perth Hospital last night after testing negative to COVID 19. The couple had been on a ""trip of a lifetime"" to celebrate their 70th birthdays and joined the cruise in Miami in late February.    ",By Claire Moodie,"April 09, 2020"

WA Health told ABC Radio Perth they were investigating the incident ""as a priority"". This included reviewing the nursing and medical support for about 2,000 guests at seven hotels across Perth and almost 200 people on Rottnest Island to ensure they had the very best access to care.   ""It is the responsibility of Healthcare Australia to determine the staffing ratio of rostered nurses and doctors required to meet the needs of people in quarantine at Crown,"" a statement said. ""It is important to note that the people inside quarantine at Crown are not hospital patients — if they require clinical care then they are transferred to hospital."" WA Health said PPE was always available at Crown and was restocked as necessary. Australian Medical Association WA president Andrew Miller said the doctor's claims about a lack of PPE should not be dismissed. ""We know it has been very short in lots of places so it would be surprising to us if the Crown hotel was the one place in Perth that had a good supply of PPE,"" Dr Miller said.   ""She's a doctor of impeccable reputation and long experience so I think that her claims need to be taken seriously and fully investigated, and not just batted away. ""The position the doctor was put in, I think, was unreasonable. ""Above all, we need to ensure that these people are being properly looked after. ""If they are being forced into quarantine by the community then the Government needs to provide them with adequate supervision and medical care."" Mrs Watson was released from Royal Perth Hospital last night after testing negative to COVID 19. The couple had been on a ""trip of a lifetime"" to celebrate their 70th birthdays and joined the cruise in Miami in late February.    ",By Claire Moodie,"April 09, 2020"
47,/news/2020-04-09/fines-for-spitting-coughing-in-nsw-coronavirus-lockdown/12138086,"NSW Health introduces $5,000 fine for spitting or coughing on frontline workers in coronavirus lockdown","Spitting and coughing on public officials, such as healthcare workers and police, in New South Wales will now see offenders slapped with a $5,000 on-the-spot fine.   NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said a disturbing trend of abuse and assault towards people in uniform amid the coronavirus pandemic forced the State Government to introduce penalties for aggressive behaviour. He said government intervention was necessary because of a ""sufficient minority"" of people causing harm. ""How incredibly ridiculous is it that anybody could think it's acceptable to spit or caught on frontline health workers, health officials, police or indeed any of our Border Force officials,"" he said. ""These frontline workers are caring for us and the simple fact is we need to care for them.""   The change under the Public Health Regulation 2012 was signed on Thursday after an ""urgent"" request from NSW Health and representatives from unions for healthcare services and police. People found intentionally spitting or coughing on police officers during the pandemic could also be jailed for up to six months. The chief of the Police Association NSW, Tony King, said officers were on the receiving end of ""despicable and vile behaviour"". ""We've had incidents where people think it's funny to record walking into police stations and coughing and put it up on social media, this is disgusting,"" Mr King said.   NSW Police reported people receiving fines for not adhering to physical-distancing guidelines were coughing on officers and then claiming they had COVID-19. Last week, the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association (NMA) reported healthcare workers were being told not to wear their uniforms outside of the hospital. Nurses and midwives reported being assaulted on public transport, refused service at grocery stores and spit on by members of the public accusing them of spreading the virus.   NMA general secretary Brett Holmes said he received dozens of reports of abuse from nurses and midwives, some from Thursday morning. He said he was hearing similar reports from healthcare workers in other states. ""This is a strong message to those people who are ignorantly accusing health workers of spreading the disease because they're travelling to and from work dressed in their uniform,"" he said. Mr Holmes said there was a ""great deal of aggression"" towards NMA members and spitting was on the ""serious end"" of abuse because it exposed them to COVID-19, which they could take home to their families. ""We've had nurses on trains surrounded by a couple of young persons who then decided that this person was a nurse so therefore they had to cough all over her,"" he said. ""This is a growing behaviour that needs to be stamped out now.""    ",By Kevin Nguyen,"April 09, 2020"

49,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-family-and-domestic-violence-fears-grow/12136652,Coronavirus pressures see extra focus placed on family and domestic violence,"Michelle* is a survivor of both family and domestic abuse.   The 49-year-old grew up in a home where conversations quickly turned into arguments and those arguments too often into fights — her father was angry and controlling. She found love, married and had two daughters of her own, but after struggling with post-natal depression, and later alcoholism, Michelle left her husband for another man. The relationship with the person she believed to be the man of her dreams soon turned into a nightmare and she has had a number of unhealthy and abusive relationships since. Today, when Michelle heads home after work as a bus driver, she will not have to worry about her environment. But she keenly feels how hard it must be for people forced to stay at home in similar situations under the current coronavirus shutdown. ""It would be absolutely terrifying,"" Michelle said. ""Because even if you know innately that this is wrong, that you shouldn't be putting up with this type of behaviour, if you can't leave the house, I mean what do you do?""   With reports of family and domestic violence increasing, service providers across the country have reinforced a single message — they are open for business. In Western Australia the restrictions on movement to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has seen the road toll drop and the crime rate plunge.  Yet those figures provided by WA Police to ABC Radio Perth, which compared the past month to the same period last year, showed domestic violence was increasing. While a 5 per cent increase might seem small, WA Minister for Prevention of Family and Domestic Violence Simone McGurk said any increase was worrying.   ""We're at about 48,000 reported incidents to police each year, just short of 1,000 a week, so either way we've still got a massive problem,"" she said. She said the community may well be in the eye of the domestic violence storm, ""All the evidence internationally is that we can expect that this pressure of COVID — the social isolation, the economic destabilisation that's occurred — will actually give perpetrators of domestic violence additional opportunities to exercise control and power and to be violent."" A dedicated COVID-19 family and domestic violence taskforce has been set up within the Department of Communities to work with police and service providers to ensure services remain open during the pandemic.   The legislation allows courts to impose electronic monitoring on offenders in a range of circumstances and also improves access to restraining orders, with applications now able to be lodged online. A separate offence for breach of a family violence restraining order came into force from Monday with the penalty increased from $6,000 to $10,000. The Federal Government has also committed $150 million towards family and domestic violence to be shared by states and territories over the next two years. Ms McGurk said while that funding was still being distributed, WA was expecting $3 million before the end of June and additional crisis accommodation, to relieve pressure on women's refuges, was expected to be part of it. ""But you don't just want to give people accommodation, you want to make sure that they've also got support,"" Ms McGurk said. A national advertising and awareness campaign was announced as part of the $150 million federal package but local advocates have called for a statewide campaign as well.   Lara Steel, a domestic violence specialist with Anglicare WA, said if coronavirus created an increased risk inside homes it was imperative the message that help was still available was shared widely. ""It needs to be on mainstream media, it needs to be on radio, it needs to be across as many platforms as possible,"" she said. ""If they just happen to turn the TV on and a message blares into the lounge room about family and domestic violence services, the person who's feeling unsafe isn't responsible for that but they still receive the message."" Ms Steel said while the focus needed to be on victims, she hoped it was a message heeded by potential abusers as well as those at risk. ""The other component of that work is also to encourage people who are struggling with the stress — and they know that stress is one of the risk factors for abusive tactics or violence — to actually take responsibility for that and get a professional on the phone from one of the helplines and create a safety plan,"" she said.   With expectations of grim times ahead, Ms McGurk said she was encouraged by the collaborative approach being taken by the sector But she added preventing family violence would need help from the whole community. ""It was only in February I think that Hannah Clarke died with her children and the country was quite rightly horrified and shocked — devastated by such a hideous set of murders and they likely should be,"" she said. ""Sadly though, we know that women are dying all too often, and they don't get that sort of attention. ""It's about stopping those deaths but also making sure that everyone's got the message there is help should they need it.
