""Existing clients basically straight away [saying] 'put our jobs on hold',"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Mr Fowkes said about two dozen customers had shelved plans to install rooftop solar in the wake of the sudden axing of the Northern Territory's one-to-one feed-in tariff. The generous rate at which solar system-owners were paid for excess energy sent back to the grid helped drive rooftop solar uptake in the NT from the lowest levels in the country to levels that experts warned the Top End grid had not been upgraded to manage. A 67 per cent cut to the tariff for new systems — from 24 cents for every kilowatt hour down to eight — was rolled in with the Government's announcement this week of $30 million for a large-scale battery to support the Darwin to Katherine system. Renewables Minister Dale Wakefield said the battery and $800,000 in subsidies for more rooftop solar storage were ""two huge steps forward in our plan for 50 per cent renewables by 2030."" But she refused to say why the tariff change was made without notice, when the Government had promised consultations and a draft policy to be released last year. Mr Fowkes said solar installers were not prepared for a snap announcement but knew a policy change was coming. ""We all knew how unstable the grid was and how hard it was for Power and Water to maintain the voltage et cetera,"" he said. ""But a bit of notice, and maybe even some better timing, would have been helpful."" Ms Wakefield said Labor was continuing with ""the business of government"" while dealing with the coronavirus fallout, including its renewables and energy policies.   She acknowledged recent criticism by the Utilities Commission, which commented on ""significant changes"" in the Darwin to Katherine grid, where rooftop solar had ""exceeded expectations"" and 60 megawatts of large-scale solar was due for connection in coming months. The commission said it had to approve tough new technical requirements on large-scale solar generators to head off ""serious reliability and security issues"" on the system, partly because of a lack of government progress on its promised reforms. ""That's why it's been important for us to continue this work even throughout the COVID crisis,"" Ms Wakefield said. ""We want to make sure we've got a stable and strong power system that delivers what Territorians need."" The NT Government said its large-scale battery would save government-owned Territory Generation $6.4 million and 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. The author of the Government's Roadmap to Renewables report, Alan Langworthy, said Labor deserved credit for moving in the right direction, but he said there was much more reform work to be done. And he said there remained a ""very significant risk"" of a system crash on the Darwin to Katherine grid. ""It will be two years before the [large-scale] battery is up and going, and I'm not sure the current mechanisms for household use are going to change people's demand or generation model at all,"" he said. ""That still leaves the grid in quite a lot of vulnerability."" A Government spokesperson said the $800,000 set aside for battery subsidies would cover up to 130 grants. But about 12,000 households and businesses installed rooftop solar before the tariff change, according to retailer Jacana Energy. Under grandfathering arrangements, those customers will continue to receive the one-for-one rebate, surrendering it only if they move, upgrade their system capacity, or take up the battery subsidy. The Government said its tariff change was a recommendation from the roadmap report, but Mr Langworthy said the actual guidance was for the creation of a time-of-day feed-in tariff to encourage greater battery uptake. Using a time-of-day tariff, customers get paid more for their power if it is exported to the grid during a peak-demand period like the early evening. ""With net metering left in place there's no incentive for people to install a battery, so basically it's status quo,"" Mr Langworthy said. ""If the Government had in fact instituted a time-of-day tariff they could have gotten a good solid take-up of battery support delivering energy into the system when they really need it, which is in the 5:00 to 9:00 at night period."" Ms Wakefield said the Government was considering the time-of-day tariff proposal and would monitor the uptake of batteries going forward. She also said the Government would speak with small solar installers like Ms Fowkes, who were imploring the Government to allow a tariff-change grace period. ""We know that solar is still a great investment for people when people sit down and do the figures,"" she said. ""We know that solar business will continue to thrive in the Territory because Territorians have been voting with their feet because of the savings they can make on their bill.""",By Jacqueline Breen,"April 09, 2020"

2,/news/2020-04-09/online-gaming-hits-huge-numbers-during-coronavirus-pandemic/12135714?section=technology,Online gaming is getting a big boost from the coronavirus pandemic — and experts say it's just the beginning,"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, most Australian parents would agree that online gaming was a lot more than just a growing trend.   Already a hundred-billion-dollar global industry, online gaming has become a popular pastime for many, and even a full-blown profession for some. Dedicated esports arenas, huge tournaments and the migration of traditional sport into the virtual world in recent years have proven it was already here to stay. But off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, the proliferation of online gaming in households is predicted to go to the next level. James Birt, Associate Professor in Information and Computing Science at Bond University, has studied emerging technology for the past 20 years and says he is seeing record-breaking levels of participation.   Some game manufacturers across the world have reported downloads have more than doubled, while a staggering 1.2 billion hours of content was consumed on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""The number of people playing games is off the charts, we have never seen this many players streaming and playing simultaneously online, in the history of gaming,"" Associate Professor Birt said. Earlier this week, Twitch reported it had more than 4 million concurrent viewers on its platform for the first time, after the release of Valorant, by Riot Games. ""I think what COVID-19 has really created is this point in time that one could say, is when this movement happened,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""Kids, esports enthusiasts, just [the] general public are getting into games in a way that they have never done in history. ""What we see now is those people that hadn't engaged in esports and gaming prior to the pandemic are now driving in droves towards new opportunities new experiences, new collaborative opportunities with friends.""     Motorsport is one of a number of Australian sports well placed during the downtime to take advantage of the booming interest and willingness of fans to watch online games. The inaugural All Stars Eseries event took place on Wednesday night and saw drivers competing remotely against each other online, in the first of 10 rounds. It was broadcast live on Fox Sports and streamed across multiple social platforms.   The competition followed the script from recent years in Supercars, with 2018 and 2019 series champion Scott McLaughlin winning two of the three races. The first two races featured the Phillip Island virtual circuit, while the final race was held using a digital version of the famous Monza track, home of the Italian Formula One grand prix. Like almost all of Australian sport, the traditional Supercars series — in which drivers and teams compete on tracks around the country — is on hold because of the pandemic. Instead, simulators have been installed in the homes of 25 drivers, who are getting used to the idea of getting suited up and racing the competition from the comfort of their own living space.   Holden driver Chaz Mostert has welcomed the initiative. ""Supercars has done all that it can to set this up so we can at least keep the fans entertained at home … I'm sure it's killing people like myself who wish we were racing, on the track, but we're making do with what we can at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a bit different, strolling down the stairs and going into the garage [to the simulator], it's a bit more unique than getting on a plane and going to a round!"" Similar moves are taking place in the United States, where NBA players have been pitted against each other in a special NBA 2K tournament, set to broadcast on ESPN. It is an example of how esports can also showcase sports stars in a unique way, by cutting to player reactions and banter over a mix of gameplay. Associate Professor Birt says many sports should be looking to take advantage of the unique opportunities that online gaming presents, given sports entertainment can now easily cross digital borders. ""The increase in the power behind the computing and the capacity to present the materials in 4K, we really are moving towards photo-realism in our games,"" he said. ""We are going to see even more dramatic increases this year with the release of things like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox [Series X],"" he said.   Mostert himself has been blown away by the quality of the visuals in his gaming experience, and said he was interested in being able to see the races on replay to get a different perspective from the simulator. ""I think we [drivers] are like fans, we're still going to be watching [the replay] tomorrow, even though the race happened today,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to having good on-track battles as well, it's still the same competition that we're used to out in the real world, and no doubt we'll still be racing for sheep stations in the virtual world as well."" With traditional sport still in a pandemic-induced hiatus, esports is expected to further develop its role in the Australian sporting landscape in the months ahead. ""I think there is this incredible blend between the technical capacity of esports to essentially get into people's living rooms,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""What television hasn't been able to do is create that connection between players, the games and the brands.""    ",By Patrick Galloway,"April 09, 2020"

Never fear. There's a circuit-breaker on the way tonight and all have you have to do is look up. A supermoon tipped to be the biggest this year will grace southern hemisphere skies. It has already made an appearance in the northern hemisphere, where it was reported to be the largest supermoon of the year. A supermoon occurs when a full moon is especially close to the Earth, making it look up to 10 per cent bigger and brighter than normal. This one will be a mere 356,907 kilometres away. These moons have many types: super blue blood moon and super blood wolf moon are just two. Tonight's is called a pink supermoon. In northern climes, the April supermoon is so named because it often arrives at the same time as early spring pink phlox flowers. The best time to see it will be 11:00pm AEST. If you want to get ahead of the game, use a phone app to work out where it will be rising. You might have seen those seemingly massive moons rising early in the evening throughout March. They are an illusion and are just being tricky. The moon this time of year might look closer earlier in the evening, but the tip is to set the alarm for a bit later. By 11:00pm, it will be higher in the sky.   People in the northern hemisphere have reported the lack of pollution in some centres — where industry has been reduced or entirely shut down by coronavirus restrictions — has given them the best supermoon view for some time. Here, where pollution is not the main enemy, fingers will be crossed for a cloud-free night.  Sydney is not looking great and cloudy conditions are forecast in Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra as well. Darwin will have a bit of cloud around but Perth and Adelaide look to be clear. The best Tasmanian locations will be in the south. If you want to snap a photo at home, there are some things to remember: Don't expect wonders from your smartphone.  While their cameras are getting better and better, they can still distort the image and make the Moon look quite small. You could try zooming in (although digital zoom will reduce the quality) or attaching your phone to a telescope. A tripod or a solid surface like a windowsill can help get a sharp picture, and turning off lights nearby can also help. And remember, having something like a tree or building in the frame can give it more context. For those with DSLRs, you already know what you're doing; the longer the lens, the better.

It is a problem experts warn could worsen Australia's educational divide unless the government steps up. Seventy per cent of the families at Playford College in Adelaide's north are on welfare. Many families at the school can barely afford books, let alone a laptop or a decent home internet plan. It's not uncommon for four students to be sharing one laptop at home, according to the school's deputy principal Racha Makki.   She feared online schooling would further set back her students' educational outcomes. ""There is a chance that the only device at home is for the parents; you might have three to four children who attend primary school in the same household and all these children are expected to be online in many cases at the same time,"" she said. ""Internet is a problem as well; in many cases internet is on one device which is for the mum or the dad. ""If we don't provide for our kids what they need, they will be even more disadvantaged."" Like many schools, Playford College teachers are going above and beyond to find work around solutions, including staggering lesson times via year level so each student in a family can still get some time with their teacher each day.   The school, which opened four years ago, supplies a laptop for every middle school student and has loaned out all remaining laptops and tablets to families in need. But principal Chris Riemann said there was still a significant shortage. He said the school community had an added challenge, as most of its students spoke languages other than English at home. ""Our students already start behind many school populations just because of English … the school does very well with intensive English to get the children up to speed, but they can't do that in a home learning environment,"" he said. ""They're serious challenges for our community. ""If the government could provide technology at home for disadvantaged families like ours, families on welfare, then that would be incredibly helpful.""

8,/news/2020-04-08/whatsapp-youtube-coronavirus-conspiracies-5g-network/12131842?section=technology,WhatsApp and YouTube are cracking down on coronavirus conspiracies and misinformation,"While health authorities are working to stop the spread of coronavirus, social media giants are facing a contagion of their own: conspiracy theories.  And in a bid to crack down on what the World Health Organisation has labelled an ""infodemic"" of misinformation, you may find yourself facing restrictions in the digital world as well. WhatsApp, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, has announced it is tightening message forwarding limits, restricting users to sharing forwarded content one chat at a time. The decision follows a jump in messages touting bogus medical advice since the start of the coronavirus crisis.   ""Is all forwarding bad? Certainly not. We know many users forward helpful information, as well as funny videos, memes, and reflections or prayers they find meaningful,"" the company said in a statement. ""However, we've seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation.  ""We believe it's important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation.""     WhatsApp isn't alone in its bid to limit the spread of misinformation. YouTube has now banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G networks, according to the BBC.   The conspiracy, which claims there's a direct link between 5G equipment and the COVID-19 outbreak, has sparked arson attacks on mobile phone masts in the United Kingdom. In a live-streamed interview on YouTube on Monday, conspiracy theorist David Icke — who was last year banned from entering Australia — falsely claimed there is a ""link between 5G and this health crisis"". Following criticisms for allowing the video, which was watched by about 65,000 people, to be broadcast on its platform, the company told the BBC it would be removed, alongside any content disputing the ""existence or transmission"" of COVID-19. ""We have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment,"" a spokeswoman told the news outlet. ""Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of COVID-19, as described by the WHO and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies. ""This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G.""   YouTube has been contacted for further response. Facebook and Twitter have also responded to the deluge of inaccurate medical information posted in recent months by barring users from posting misleading information about coronavirus, including denials of expert guidance and encouragement of fake treatments.

9,/news/2020-04-08/whatsapp-youtube-coronavirus-conspiracies-5g-network/12131842?section=technology,WhatsApp and YouTube are cracking down on coronavirus conspiracies and misinformation,"While health authorities are working to stop the spread of coronavirus, social media giants are facing a contagion of their own: conspiracy theories.  And in a bid to crack down on what the World Health Organisation has labelled an ""infodemic"" of misinformation, you may find yourself facing restrictions in the digital world as well. WhatsApp, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, has announced it is tightening message forwarding limits, restricting users to sharing forwarded content one chat at a time. The decision follows a jump in messages touting bogus medical advice since the start of the coronavirus crisis.   ""Is all forwarding bad? Certainly not. We know many users forward helpful information, as well as funny videos, memes, and reflections or prayers they find meaningful,"" the company said in a statement. ""However, we've seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation.  ""We believe it's important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation.""     WhatsApp isn't alone in its bid to limit the spread of misinformation. YouTube has now banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G networks, according to the BBC.

Zoos, wildlife parks, museums and aquariums are among those offering tours, talks and live streams that allow people to holiday at home — quite literally. In New South Wales, Taronga Zoo has scrambled to set up live streams of some of its animal enclosures, including tigers, elephants, and seals. It has also put animal feeding and talks online.

""I couldn't say that virtual travel is the way of the future because there's nothing like tasting the salt air or seeing that kangaroo or sea lion in situ,"" Mr Turner said.   ""But at the same time I think it's making us reflect a little bit about how we connect with nature."" On the other side of the country, the Busselton Jetty in Western Australia's South West has also moved its tours and activities online.

12,/news/2020-04-08/future-tense-nuclear-fusion-sustainable-power-promise/12114948?section=technology,"Nuclear fusion promises a clean, green energy future — but there's a catch","It's a nuclear race like no other, involving billions of dollars and hundreds of scientists from across the globe. Their aim is as ambitious as it is monumental: to replicate the energy source that powers the solar system, effectively building a mini sun — a swirling mass of super-heated atomic plasma so hot that it can only be contained by a magnetic field. The process is called nuclear fusion. Scientists believe that if fusion technology can be successfully harnessed as a human energy source, it could help save the world from future environmental catastrophe. Just outside the port city of Marseille in the south of France work is underway on a giant nuclear fusion test facility known as ITER — Latin for ""the way"". Its construction is being funded by an international collaboration between 35 nations, and it's expected to cost somewhere between $27 billion and $36 billion when completed.   Australia isn't a member of the consortium, but it does have a research relationship with the project involving both the ANU and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). ""It's called the largest scientific engineering project in the world,"" says ANSTO's Richard Garrett. ""The site is many hectares. The tokomak itself — the doughnut-shaped chamber the plasma will be confined in — is just enormous, 100,000 kilometres of superconducting cable, because it uses superconducting magnets to confine this plasma as tightly as possible. ""It's about three or four Eiffel Towers' worth of steel. ""In fact, I think the world's production of superconducting wire had to be increased about 10 times to supply ITER.""   Conventional nuclear reactors harness energy from a process called fission, which involves splitting the nucleus of a large atom. Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, works by forcing atoms together in order to release energy. British physicist David Kingham says fusion technology has significant benefits over its established counterpart.   ""The advantages of fusion are: no risk of meltdown — it's very easy to stop it safely — no production of radioactive waste, and a very high energy density of the fuel,"" he says. ""In some ways fusion has all the advantages of nuclear fission without any of the drawbacks like risk of meltdown or long-lived radioactive waste."" But generating energy from nuclear fusion has proved far more difficult than scientists initially thought back in the 1960s when it was first mooted as a serious future energy source. Early test reactors managed to produce a fusion reaction, but not one that was sustainable or energy efficient. In other words, it took more energy to produce the reaction, than the reaction itself produced.   ITER was originally launched way back in 1985, amid great expectation. Its collaborative structure was designed to ensure the whole world would eventually benefit from the technology, not just one or two nations. But the initial stages of the project were problematic. On-site construction didn't begin until 2010. And even then, it was slow to get going. ""I think fundamentally that tells us that these international collaborations are quite difficult to achieve,"" Professor Garrett says. ""Five or six years ago, ITER was not in a good shape. It was late, it was over-budget. But a new directorate was put in on the project and they have really got the thing moving in the right direction.""   The first plasma experiments are now expected to begin in 2025. For ITER to be considered a success, according to Professor Garrett, it must demonstrate that it can achieve an energy gain of a factor of 10. ""ITER consumes 50 megawatts of power to produce this plasma at 150 million degrees, and the goal is to produce 500 megawatts of power from that plasma,"" he says. ""The second goal is to be able to maintain that condition for many minutes at a time, so maybe 10 minutes, up to an hour, and that's what you would need for a steady-state power reactor."" ITER isn't the only nuclear fusion initiative underway. In both North America and the United Kingdom there are numerous projects operating on a smaller scale. One of them involves the company Tokamak Energy, whose executive vice chairman is Dr Kingham. ""I think private investors can see solid scientific foundations for the business,"" he says. Tokamak Energy is yet to produce a fusion reaction at its test facility in Oxfordshire.   But that's not the immediate priority, Dr Kingham says. The company's researchers are using a spherically shaped tokamak chamber that they hope will deliver greater efficiencies than the donut-shaped one designed for ITER. The aim is to increase the plasma temperature during the fusion process.   ""The next big milestone for us is to achieve a 100 million degree (Celsius) plasma temperature,"" Dr Kingham says. After that, they'll then need to demonstrate that the enhanced superconducting magnets within the tokamak have the strength required to effectively contain the plasma. Dr Kingham expects both of those milestones to be met by the end of next year. He says the company will then need to raise the additional investment necessary to fast-track the development of a small fusion demonstrator device by 2025, the same year that ITER expects to begin its initial plasma testing. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is also seeking to outrun ITER in designing its own fusion reactor. Known as STEP, the UKAEA research collaboration has recently received a $430 million investment from the British Government.   Prime Minister Boris Johnson even made it part of his re-election pitch during December's election. Like Dr Kingham, STEP's boss Howard Wilson is cautiously critical of the approach taken by ITER. ""It looks like if you go down that route alone you'll end up with a very expensive solution which won't be commercially deployable, and that's why we are keen on innovations which will reduce the cost,"" he says. He also agrees with Dr Kingham that a focus on developing high-temperature superconducting magnets is a priority. ""If you can double the field strength of your device, reduce the size substantially, it becomes a lot cheaper but it can produce the same amount of power,"" he says. ""That really makes the difference to commercial deployability of the technology. We've got to be cost-competitive with oil, gas, coal and renewables."" Proponents of nuclear fusion believe it will end the world's dependence on fossil fuels once and forever. But the catch is that no-one involved in the research believes a fully operational, commercially viable nuclear fusion reactor will be operating before at least 2050. That fact has seen some question the level of financial investment, including Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, the director of Energy Research at Oxford University and a former director general of CERN. He once managed the UK's fusion program, but two years ago, in an interview with the Simons Centre for Geometry and Physics, he expressed doubts about ITER and the viability of the industry in general. ""I used to think that there was a reasonably good chance that fusion could compete with other low carbon sources of power, but while I would not say that it's impossible, the situation has changed,"" he said.  ""The cost of wind and solar power has decreased faster than anyone could have dreamed. Meanwhile ITER has gone way over budget. Fusion reactors will be intrinsically more expensive than we thought a decade ago.""   He argues that ITER needs to go ahead, but that a final cost comparison with renewables should be conducted before any construction on a full-scale reactor is begun. Dr Kingham understands the argument, but he believes the long-term economics still make sense. ""The point with renewables is that large-scale transmission of power across the world is not necessarily going to be feasible, and extremely large-scale storage looks prohibitively expensive and perhaps even technically not feasible,"" he says. ""So, I think fusion in the long-term sits alongside renewables as part of the low carbon solution we need to be developing and deploying.""   Professor Wilson adds that all projections indicate global energy needs are likely to dramatically increase as more and more people are lifted out of poverty in the developing world. ""Even now, Delhi consumes something like seven gigawatts of power,"" he says. ""That is a very high power density. It's hard to imagine delivering that through wind and solar."" Planning now for the mass energy requirements of the future, he argues, makes for prudent policy. ""We need to develop technologies, otherwise all we're doing is delaying the problem… leaving a problem for the next generation to try and fix,"" he says. ""Fusion is really the only clean reliable way of doing that. That's the gap that fusion is aiming to fill.""  ",ABC Radio National      By Antony Funnell for Future Tense,"April 08, 2020"

14,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-online-dating-apps-social-distancing-hinge-bumble/12128100?section=technology,Dating in isolation during a coronavirus pandemic has a surprising upside,"For single Australians looking for love, social distancing and self-isolating rules have drastically altered the dating scene. Instead of getting drinks at a bar, going for a walk in the park or meeting up for coffee, they've had to keep it to sending flirty texts and arranging virtual dates.   ""There's so many awesome things about having a first date by video chat,"" says Carissa Bennett, a women's mentor and life coach from Melbourne. ""For starters, you can wear your pyjama pants and do it from the comfort of your own couch."" With the exception of a recent six-month relationship, Carissa has been single and ""on the apps"" for the past seven years. When the coronavirus restrictions were announced, she had a moment of panic. ""The part of me that's been single for years doesn't care, and the other part of me is 34 years old and really would like to meet somebody."" So, Carissa is still on the apps — and she's not alone. As many as 70 per cent of users on the Hinge dating app have expressed interest in going on digital dates during the pandemic, according to a spokesperson.   The company is encouraging people to ""date from home"" using phone calls and video chats, and have even provided backgrounds to help Zoom dates feel like real dates. A Bumble representative says that globally there has already been a significant rise in the numbers of messages (by 23 per cent) and in-app video calls (by 31 per cent) between users since mid-March. More Tinder users are beginning to mention the coronavirus pandemic in their bios. The app has made their Passport feature available to all members, allowing users to meet anyone, anywhere in the world, and connect in this time of isolation.   People on the apps are also using the pandemic as a conversation starter.   ""Because of what's going on in the world right now, we're so deeply connected by this situation that's happening and we instantly have something in common to talk about,"" Carissa says. ""Very quickly you learn their political views, are they a pessimist or an optimist, are they open-minded."" Carissa matched with someone on Bumble who works at a major Australian bank, and who did not think that banks should be supporting businesses that were struggling because of the shutdowns. ""His perspective on what was happening was so different to mine, and I would never be interested in dating someone with that perspective,"" she says. Another person she met on an app about a year go — and went on ""a really amazing date"" with — recently reached out again to see how she was faring during the pandemic. Carissa suggested a video date, and he said yes.   Because they live in different states — she's in Victoria, he's in Queensland — they had kept in touch by text, and they couldn't believe that ""neither of us had thought about a virtual date before."" ""I think we will probably talk and maybe have a wine,"" she says. Dr Maria Scoda, a clinical psychologist who specialises in relationship counselling, says virtual dating may provide an opportunity for people to take things slow and get to know each other on a deeper level. For people who are genuinely interested in developing a connection with someone, Dr Scoda suggests creating parallel dating scenarios within the home like having dinner, playing a board game, or watching a movie together while on a video call. ""Even just talking about the mundane things together, describing your day or week, that's part of a normal relationship,"" she says.   The ""big unknown"" is whether a relationship built in the virtual world will translate in real life, Dr Scoda warns.   ""Once they meet in person, everything they've created may fall flat,"" she says. ""I know people don't want to hear that, but it's a possible reality."" May*, a 31-year-old musician from Melbourne started chatting to a woman on the dating app Raya a week ago, and they've already gone on three virtual dates. ""We're always texting and calling,"" May says. ""It's offering companionship and it's adding value to my isolation."" For their first video call, May decided to lay down in a local park and talk to her. They spoke for an hour. ""The time actually flew past, she says, ""I almost forgot that I was just lying there completely on my own."" They talk about everything from what they did that day, to dreaming up things they want to do together in the future.   ""The fact that we enjoy talking to one another and keep having things to share despite the fact that there's no physical affection is a really good sign,"" she says. ""But looking into the future too much is not really the best thing to do because there's so much uncertainty and it feels like I probably won't see her for months and months."" It's not just social distancing that's keeping May and her Raya date apart. May was meant to move to the US in April, where her Raya date lives, but the move has been put on hold indefinitely. ""I think we're trying to be as casual as possible, just enjoy it for what it is and not put too much pressure on it."" While this new dating paradigm can feel exciting, Dr Scoda says it important to understand that the risks and dangers of dating in person also present themselves when dating from home.   ""There will be people who take advantage of others and may move a video date in a sexual direction that the other person doesn't want."" If this happens, she advises to disconnect immediately.

15,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-online-dating-apps-social-distancing-hinge-bumble/12128100?section=technology,Dating in isolation during a coronavirus pandemic has a surprising upside,"For single Australians looking for love, social distancing and self-isolating rules have drastically altered the dating scene. Instead of getting drinks at a bar, going for a walk in the park or meeting up for coffee, they've had to keep it to sending flirty texts and arranging virtual dates.   ""There's so many awesome things about having a first date by video chat,"" says Carissa Bennett, a women's mentor and life coach from Melbourne. ""For starters, you can wear your pyjama pants and do it from the comfort of your own couch."" With the exception of a recent six-month relationship, Carissa has been single and ""on the apps"" for the past seven years. When the coronavirus restrictions were announced, she had a moment of panic. ""The part of me that's been single for years doesn't care, and the other part of me is 34 years old and really would like to meet somebody."" So, Carissa is still on the apps — and she's not alone. As many as 70 per cent of users on the Hinge dating app have expressed interest in going on digital dates during the pandemic, according to a spokesperson.   The company is encouraging people to ""date from home"" using phone calls and video chats, and have even provided backgrounds to help Zoom dates feel like real dates. A Bumble representative says that globally there has already been a significant rise in the numbers of messages (by 23 per cent) and in-app video calls (by 31 per cent) between users since mid-March. More Tinder users are beginning to mention the coronavirus pandemic in their bios. The app has made their Passport feature available to all members, allowing users to meet anyone, anywhere in the world, and connect in this time of isolation.   People on the apps are also using the pandemic as a conversation starter.   ""Because of what's going on in the world right now, we're so deeply connected by this situation that's happening and we instantly have something in common to talk about,"" Carissa says. ""Very quickly you learn their political views, are they a pessimist or an optimist, are they open-minded."" Carissa matched with someone on Bumble who works at a major Australian bank, and who did not think that banks should be supporting businesses that were struggling because of the shutdowns. ""His perspective on what was happening was so different to mine, and I would never be interested in dating someone with that perspective,"" she says. Another person she met on an app about a year go — and went on ""a really amazing date"" with — recently reached out again to see how she was faring during the pandemic. Carissa suggested a video date, and he said yes.   Because they live in different states — she's in Victoria, he's in Queensland — they had kept in touch by text, and they couldn't believe that ""neither of us had thought about a virtual date before."" ""I think we will probably talk and maybe have a wine,"" she says. Dr Maria Scoda, a clinical psychologist who specialises in relationship counselling, says virtual dating may provide an opportunity for people to take things slow and get to know each other on a deeper level. For people who are genuinely interested in developing a connection with someone, Dr Scoda suggests creating parallel dating scenarios within the home like having dinner, playing a board game, or watching a movie together while on a video call. ""Even just talking about the mundane things together, describing your day or week, that's part of a normal relationship,"" she says.   The ""big unknown"" is whether a relationship built in the virtual world will translate in real life, Dr Scoda warns.   ""Once they meet in person, everything they've created may fall flat,"" she says. ""I know people don't want to hear that, but it's a possible reality."" May*, a 31-year-old musician from Melbourne started chatting to a woman on the dating app Raya a week ago, and they've already gone on three virtual dates. ""We're always texting and calling,"" May says. ""It's offering companionship and it's adding value to my isolation."" For their first video call, May decided to lay down in a local park and talk to her. They spoke for an hour. ""The time actually flew past, she says, ""I almost forgot that I was just lying there completely on my own."" They talk about everything from what they did that day, to dreaming up things they want to do together in the future.   ""The fact that we enjoy talking to one another and keep having things to share despite the fact that there's no physical affection is a really good sign,"" she says. ""But looking into the future too much is not really the best thing to do because there's so much uncertainty and it feels like I probably won't see her for months and months."" It's not just social distancing that's keeping May and her Raya date apart. May was meant to move to the US in April, where her Raya date lives, but the move has been put on hold indefinitely. ""I think we're trying to be as casual as possible, just enjoy it for what it is and not put too much pressure on it."" While this new dating paradigm can feel exciting, Dr Scoda says it important to understand that the risks and dangers of dating in person also present themselves when dating from home.   ""There will be people who take advantage of others and may move a video date in a sexual direction that the other person doesn't want."" If this happens, she advises to disconnect immediately. ""Trust your gut feeling if it doesn't feel right,"" Dr Scoda says. ""People need to look after themselves while virtual dating as they would in real life dating."" There will also be single people who don't want to date right now, and Dr Scoda says this period of isolation may be a good time to reconnect with yourself.

16,/news/2020-04-07/antarctica-climate-change-law-dome-hunt-for-hydroxyl-radicals/12110980?section=technology,The hunt for hydroxyl radicals in Antarctica could reveal the secrets of our future climate ,"In every sense, gazing into an Antarctic time tunnel is a chilling experience. You lean over an icy entrance about the size of a dinner plate being exceptionally careful not to drop anything in.  It's hard to tell how far you are seeing. Five or 50 metres? A year, a decade, a century or more? As your eyes adjust they see beyond the snap-frozen present and deeper into the decades gone by.  The colour shifts from blinding white to electric blue and eventually to a darkness so unfathomable it could be a tunnel into deep space.  A core barrel is lowered into the cylindrical shaft, hanging on a cable. It travels at first through layers of hard-packed snow that still retain a connection to the atmosphere above.   Go deeper and those pore spaces close off under the weight of snow pushing down from above. The sheer compressive force compacts fluffy snowflakes into solid ice, trapping a tiny bubble of atmosphere from that moment.  Each bubble becomes a time capsule. The drill drops through the centuries, reaching for our pre-industrial past. To solve one of the enduring climate change riddles, we're going to need a lot of air from an awful lot of these bubbles.   In the summer of 2018-19, a team of Australian and US scientists headed ""deep field"" from the Australian Antarctic Division's Casey Station. They had set themselves a difficult challenge: haul hundreds of tonnes of delicate equipment, drilling rigs and enough supplies to the far side of distant Law Dome for three months to camp out in the ""home of the blizzard"". Their aim was to drill for a handful of atoms that could reveal how well the chemistry of the atmosphere had been removing problem greenhouse gases like methane. ""We know we're headed towards more [global] warming, but we don't know how exactly the atmosphere is going to behave as we continue to add more greenhouse gases to it,"" explains glaciologist Peter Neff.   Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is mostly removed from the atmosphere by plants and absorption into the ocean, but it's a slow process.  Other warming gases like methane and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are more chemically active. They are partly removed from the atmosphere by a highly reactive, naturally occurring molecule called hydroxyl (OH).   ""The hydroxyl radical is sometimes called the detergent of the atmosphere,"" says atmospheric chemist Vasilii Petrenko.  Direct atmospheric measurements of hydroxyl only date from the mid-1980s. What climate modellers need is information back to the beginning of the industrial period so we can work out what OH was up to before we started adding to its workload with ever-increasing emissions. ""We know that it's probably been keeping up over the last couple of decades, but before that there's no information,"" adds co-investigator David Etheridge from the CSIRO. There would be profound implications if this extremely helpful molecule is found to have been losing its capacity to scrub the skies over time. Corrections would be needed for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it will continue to build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter, much faster than currently predicted.    About six years ago, Petrenko and his colleagues realised they might have found a way to uncover hydroxyl's secret history. A technique they pioneered in Greenland to analyse tell-tale carbon 14 (14C) atoms in ice cores had allowed the underlying sources of our rising methane emissions to be pinpointed.  If they could now mine enough ice as quickly as possible, they reasoned, and from just the right spot in Antarctica, enough trapped 14C atoms could be recovered to reconstruct the OH chemistry of the past.  Just the right spot meant Law Dome.    Law Dome is not the sort of place most sensible people would choose to pitch a tent. Even penguins don't visit.  The weather can be truly awful — think -25C on a summer's day. That's before you add in wind chill from storm-force gales that sweep the summit and blizzards dumping more snow here than nearly anywhere else in Antarctica.  ""A lot of snowfall comes off the coast, hits this very, very slight incline and dumps a lot of snow,"" Etheridge, an atmospheric scientist, shouts over a blizzard, ""about 4 metres per year, which is enormous by Antarctic standards. ""It's what we want, it's just not very comfortable.""  Life expectancy for an exposed human caught out in bad weather here is counted in minutes, not days.  Of course, it's not the endless views of a white nothingness that attracted Etheridge and the team of polar veterans to such a challenging place. The lure is lying directly under the thin nylon floor of our tents.    ""Law Dome is a stack of ancient snow that has been compressed into ice,"" Neff explains. ""The snow that accumulates here never melts so it's just this layer cake of years, with the most recent year's snowfall on top of the dome and then successively older layers at depth.""  We sleep on nearly a kilometre and a half of layered ice holding an impeccable atmospheric record stretching back at least 80,000 years.  Bounded by a pair of glaciers that drain ice from the enormous East Antarctic ice sheet, the 1,400-metre-high dome sits apart from the complicated ice flows of the continent like an island in a stream. Cores drilled here by Etheridge in the 1980s revealed, with unparalleled clarity, the rapid increase in greenhouse gases expelled over the industrial period. Now the team hopes to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through this same interval.  The team begins a military-style operation to extract ice cores in all weather conditions, with constant speed and absolute cleanliness.    The clock is ticking from the moment each ice core arrives at the surface. Cosmic rays start to create new radiocarbon atoms that can compromise the final counts.  ""We drill a lot of ice and then we destroy it really quickly in a very precise way to capture those ancient air bubbles that are trapped in the ice,"" says Neff.    It's a surreal sight. In the whiteout of a blizzard, Petrenko and Neff emerge from what looks to be a white circus tent dressed in white cleanroom coveralls, hauling precious blueish cores on a sled behind them to the melter shelter.  Here they process the ice, placing core after core in a giant stainless-steel vessel that looks part space capsule, part pot still.  ""The Hot Tub Time Machine — I thought that was an appropriate descriptor,"" quips Neff. ""Once the hot tub melts the ice, your time machine is there in those air bubbles."" Each of the 20 sled runs sees about half a tonne of ice loaded into the melter, yielding around 50 litres of ancient air per sample for processing back in the US and Australia. The deepest ice is retrieved from about 240 metres, holding air from the world of the 1870s — the time of Ned Kelly, Edison's first lightbulb and the dawn of the Age of Oil.   The problem for scientists is that there is absolutely no hydroxyl left in it. ""The hydroxyl radical is naturally produced in the atmosphere via what's called photochemistry,"" explains Petrenko. ""Hydroxyl radicals are extremely reactive. They stick around for typically a small fraction of a second."" It's an instant reaction that helps scrub the atmosphere, but if an OH molecule in 1875 survived for less than a second, how can anyone hope to measure its fleeting existence so many years later?  Hydroxyl might be long gone but the air trapped in the bubbles should retain its lingering radioactive fingerprint in the form of individual carbon 14 atoms of carbon monoxide.    ""Carbon 14 monoxide is produced in the atmosphere through cosmic rays at a rate that we can pretty much understand,"" says Etheridge. ""It's removed almost entirely by hydroxyl. All we need then is to measure the concentration and we can balance the equation and work out the amount of hydroxyl.""  A year later, the processed gas samples arrive in a black plastic case at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Sydney. The timing is profound. Sydney is sweltering under a blanket of smoke from climate-fuelled fires burning up and down the coast. The ice was drilled during Australia's then-hottest summer on record. Now the air from it will be analysed during the Black Summer of 2019.    ""This carbon, if you put a price tag on it, is possibly the most expensive carbon there is on the planet,"" says Andrew Smith from ANSTO's Centre for Accelerator Science. Weight for weight, the atoms might be more expensive than diamond but their value to the world at large could be priceless.  ""Ten million dollars in the slot!"" Smith shouts over the roar of vacuum pumps as he loads a sample carousel into the ion source of the 10 million-volt ANTARES tandem accelerator. ""It's critical that we get this right … otherwise we'll have nothing."" Deep inside the machine, each sample in turn is hammered by a caesium plasma, liberating carbon 14 atoms and shooting them towards the detector at 10 per cent of the speed of light. The ANSTO accelerator runs for 50 straight hours. The tests deliver a good set of data and it's now a matter of interpreting the results. Over the coming months scientists will analyse how well hydroxyl has kept mopping up the pollutants we have been throwing at it over the last 150 years. We'll be able to chart hydroxyl alongside carbon dioxide and methane through the industrial age.   It could be that the final calculations will reveal hydroxyl continues to clean the atmosphere without hindrance. But the fear is that the ice reveals the opposite.  There will be profound implications if it's found that this detergent has been losing its capacity to clean the atmosphere over time. Climate modellers would need to make corrections for how long methane hangs around and how quickly it might build up in the future. In short, things could get hotter faster than currently predicted. ""We certainly are warming the planet,"" says Petrenko. ""The climate models are predicting [it is] going to result in things like sea-level rise and increases in extreme climate events, which are going to be dangerous and in some cases potentially catastrophic for our civilisation.""   Science, for the most part, is neither quick nor easy. Whether grappling with a viral pandemic or an angry atmosphere, both the scientific process and its practitioners construct an evolving framework of understanding based on evidence.  Now, more than ever, our civilisation depends on it. Watch Atom Hunters of Antarctica on Foreign Correspondent on ABC TV and iview.

18,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-shifts-consumer-behaviour-and-helps-businesses-boom/12119508?section=technology,Coronavirus shifts consumer behaviour and helps some businesses boom,"Social distancing measures and shutdowns introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic have forced everyone to rethink their everyday interactions. It may permanently change the we live and work, according to Australian business leaders.   Teleconferencing services like Zoom and Skype, food delivery services like Uber Eats and Deliveroo, and bricks and mortar businesses like Bunnings now see the future differently. They are a few of the fortunate businesses that have not just survived the biggest health and economic catastrophe of the century, but are booming. However, the crisis has also raised new questions about privacy and security. If more of us are online and using apps to do everything from birthday parties, weddings and funerals to high-level business board meetings and cabinet discussions, what responsibilities do companies have to protect our information?   This is a question that Zoom, which reports a big uptick in usage of its free video conferencing app, has had to answer in recent weeks. After some cases of so-called ""Zoombombing"" — where hackers or trolls hijack a public video call — the company's security and privacy protections have come under heavy scrutiny, including in its home country where the New York Attorney-General is running an investigation.   Zoom's head of APAC, Michael Chetner, says the company takes its security and privacy obligations seriously, and ""we comply with all the local laws of the jurisdictions we operate in"". But he agrees that as use of the app — and thereby scrutiny — increases, how the company treats and communicates these issues takes on a new meaning. ""Scrutiny will increase, and we have to make sure everyone's comfortable with our rigorous security and privacy policies in place,"" he told ABC News. ""If that means better communicating it then we have to continue communicating it for sure.""   Mr Chetner says videoconferencing never been accessed as it is now. Technology is now a requirement, not a wish list. ""This is the biggest remote working experiment that the world has ever seen,"" he said. He noted recent cases of Italians using Zoom to conduct a wedding, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern using the platform to pull together a cabinet meeting, and even senators in Brazil using it to vote on legislation. ""We're forcing elements of digital transformation to happen,"" he said.   In Australia there has been more demand for services in rural and regional areas and around education and health. Mr Chetner says once there is more widespread use — with educators teaching their students and health professionals using the medium to deliver e-health services — ""the increase will be exponential"". ""It's still very early to tell whether that free user growth is going to turn into paying customers,"" he said, but noted in time that could happen. ""As of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, conducted on Zoom was about 10 million. ""In March this year, we reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid."" The introduction of social distancing measures and related closures of businesses has hit the cafe and restaurant sector especially hard.   But companies like UberEats and Deliveroo — which for some time have faced heavy opposition from bricks and mortar businesses for not paying the industry enough of a cut — are now seeing droves of temporarily shut-down restaurants move onto their platform. Deliveroo chief executive Ed McManus said in the week after bans were introduced, the company saw an additional 1,700 restaurants come onto their platform. This includes higher-end restaurants, and those which in the non-coronavirus-period typically had long lines of customers waiting outside their doors, such as Melbourne's Chin Chin. Mr McManus says there has also been growth in the number of new consumers ordering through the app, as well as in the volume of deliveries. ""The restaurant and café business is open for delivery,"" he said. ""We have seen steady growth over past few weeks particularly in lunchtime demand."" He says coronavirus does raise interesting questions about whether consumer behaviour is now forever changed across industries, especially in retailing. ""It depends how long this lasts,"" he said, but added Australians loved dining out with friends and family, and that would likely always be the case.   Uber Eats regional general manager Jodie Auster says the platform already has more than 20,000 restaurant partners to choose from. ""Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic we have witnessed an influx of new restaurants … looking for ways to increase their digital business,"" she said. Uber Eats has deployed staff from other parts of its business, including New Zealand, to meet this increased demand. 'Leave at door' contactless delivery is now available in all Australian cities. But while this is an ""unprecedented time for businesses across the world"", according to Ms Auster, once the crisis ends she expects Australians will return to dining out. ""Dining out has always been an important part of our lives, and will continue to be,"" she said. Chapel Street Precinct Association general manager Chrissie Maus said businesses have been forced to pivot to home delivery to survive this pandemic period, but were reluctantly using the online delivery platforms which charged ""sky-high commissions"". Mr McManus said, ""we do hear that message, but we're not in a position to reduce commissioners because if we did, we'd have to pay delivery riders less"". Will Davies, chief executive and co-founder of car sharing platform Car Next Door, said at one point last month their service was up 70 per cent compared to the same time last year. While demand has since dropped off, he says Australians are still using car sharing, especially people in the healthcare industry who are still travelling to and from work but don't have a car and don't want to use public transport.   The retail sector, however, may have permanently changed. Bunnings managing director Mike Schneider says the retailer has seen unprecedented demand for goods as more Australians work and spend time at home. ""We're adapting to new ways of living and working at the moment,"" he said.   Mr Schneider says there has been a huge wave of people purchasing supplies to build home offices and home classrooms. But there has also been steady strong demand for cleaning products, seedlings and general garden supplies including seedlings. The company's online marketplace has also been booming, with people purchasing gym equipment and various home fittings and furnishings. Mr Schneider said in March there were about 30 million visits to the Bunnings website. ""That's started to flow through to increased products purchased through the website,"" he said. The percentage of customers opting for online delivery also increased. ""It's often said it takes three months to build a new habit, and this seems to have legs,"" he said. ""Our patterns of living our going to change, and if that changes then what you buy and how you buy it changes. ""That presents a challenge for business to adapt. ""There's no doubt that the online retailing space will.""   Businesses that have already been operating online have been unexpected winners in this crisis. Kate Morris, founder of adorebeauty.com.au, says her Melbourne-based business has never seen such a leap in demand for online beauty and skincare products.   She expects they will hit over the budget target of $100 million turnover this year, thanks to a huge spike in demand for products including handwash, hand sanitiser and soap and skincare. ""Premium handwash sales are up 342 per cent,"" she said.   Since beauty salons closed and people stopped going to hairdressers because of stricter social distancing measures, Ms Morris says sales of shampoo and conditioners as well as ""feel-good"" items like face masks have also soared. ""We don't know how long this [sales boom] will go on for, but it's fair to say the jump has been somewhat dramatic,"" she said. ""There's a big uplift in new customers shopping with us for the first time. It's possible that they were shopping online somewhere else before or they are first-time online shoppers."" It's not just the beauty industry benefitting. Australian online bookstore Booktopia's deputy CEO and CTO Wayne Baskin says they are hitting their budget targets because demand for some books has gone up. ""We're seeing more than 100 per cent growth in fiction titles,"" he said, noting that sales of education textbooks had declined steeply. ""A lot of the universities have delayed their courses as international students aren't coming in anymore."" Since mid-March, following a ban on open home inspections and on-site auctions, there's been some growth in online auctions and livestreaming of auctions. Peter Gibbons runs Openn Negotiation, which operates pre-contracted auctions where bidders participate on an online platform. ""We have been absolutely inundated by [enquiries from] agents since coronavirus,"" he said. ""We currently have over 200 live auctions in process … with 231 new trained agents in the past couple of weeks.""   David Scholes, the founder of another online bidding platform called SoldOnline, also reports more real estate agents are enquiring about using the platform. He describes SoldOnline as ""the eBay for property sales"", where the vendor typically pays a $399 fee to join up and buyers make real-time virtual bids for properties through a registered portal. Agents are watching what bidders are doing and can talk to them by phone or through a chat bot. In the online world, it is still entirely up to the agent to ensure people are not engaging in fake bidding. ""Since the Prime Minister's announcement, SoldOnline is also working closely with 35 individual agencies to switch to online auctions, with one agency already listing 16 properties with the online platform,"" he said. ""The first coronavirus-impacted auction went ahead last week, and it achieved $13,000 over reserve. ""We have seen enquires go through the roof — in the past week I estimate I have fielded about 150 phone calls from real estate agents."" He says not all of these phone calls translated to agents moving onto the platform. Some agents still prefer to use livestreaming options over an online bidding site. Brendan Condon, chief executive of Melbourne-based urban farming company Biofilta, has already seen people's living habits change. His business offers a ""Foodcube"" that allows communities to produce large volumes of fresh food in small city spaces including backyards, carparks and rooftops.   Mr Condon said since coronavirus, Biofilta had more than doubled the number of Foodcubes it sells each month from 150 to 300. He says each module grows around 25 kilograms of fresh produce annually and the average order is between five to 10 food cubes with soil. ""That's enough for 125 kilograms to 250 kilograms of fresh produce,"" he said. ""We will see lasting change [in how people behave] as we move through this period."" But it is not just consumer habits changing. Small businesses are also adapting. Suzi Jamil is the owner and director of Think Inc, an events touring company that has in the past brought international speakers including Jane Goodall and Richard Dawkins to Australia. She said the company used to charge about $70 to $80 a ticket for people to see live events at places like the Sydney Opera House. Now, she's moved the events online and charges about $10 to $20 a ticket. Online audiences can still engage with the star of the show in real-time, with a live Q&A, and chance to do online networking after the event. ""This is a major shift [in how people behave],"" she said. ""It is teaching people to link up online. And as a small business owner based in Sydney, I can reach a global demographic.""

19,/news/2020-04-06/coronavirus-shifts-consumer-behaviour-and-helps-businesses-boom/12119508?section=technology,Coronavirus shifts consumer behaviour and helps some businesses boom,"Social distancing measures and shutdowns introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic have forced everyone to rethink their everyday interactions. It may permanently change the we live and work, according to Australian business leaders.   Teleconferencing services like Zoom and Skype, food delivery services like Uber Eats and Deliveroo, and bricks and mortar businesses like Bunnings now see the future differently. They are a few of the fortunate businesses that have not just survived the biggest health and economic catastrophe of the century, but are booming. However, the crisis has also raised new questions about privacy and security. If more of us are online and using apps to do everything from birthday parties, weddings and funerals to high-level business board meetings and cabinet discussions, what responsibilities do companies have to protect our information?   This is a question that Zoom, which reports a big uptick in usage of its free video conferencing app, has had to answer in recent weeks. After some cases of so-called ""Zoombombing"" — where hackers or trolls hijack a public video call — the company's security and privacy protections have come under heavy scrutiny, including in its home country where the New York Attorney-General is running an investigation.   Zoom's head of APAC, Michael Chetner, says the company takes its security and privacy obligations seriously, and ""we comply with all the local laws of the jurisdictions we operate in"". But he agrees that as use of the app — and thereby scrutiny — increases, how the company treats and communicates these issues takes on a new meaning. ""Scrutiny will increase, and we have to make sure everyone's comfortable with our rigorous security and privacy policies in place,"" he told ABC News. ""If that means better communicating it then we have to continue communicating it for sure.""   Mr Chetner says videoconferencing never been accessed as it is now. Technology is now a requirement, not a wish list. ""This is the biggest remote working experiment that the world has ever seen,"" he said. He noted recent cases of Italians using Zoom to conduct a wedding, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern using the platform to pull together a cabinet meeting, and even senators in Brazil using it to vote on legislation. ""We're forcing elements of digital transformation to happen,"" he said.   In Australia there has been more demand for services in rural and regional areas and around education and health. Mr Chetner says once there is more widespread use — with educators teaching their students and health professionals using the medium to deliver e-health services — ""the increase will be exponential"". ""It's still very early to tell whether that free user growth is going to turn into paying customers,"" he said, but noted in time that could happen. ""As of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, conducted on Zoom was about 10 million. ""In March this year, we reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid."" The introduction of social distancing measures and related closures of businesses has hit the cafe and restaurant sector especially hard.   But companies like UberEats and Deliveroo — which for some time have faced heavy opposition from bricks and mortar businesses for not paying the industry enough of a cut — are now seeing droves of temporarily shut-down restaurants move onto their platform. Deliveroo chief executive Ed McManus said in the week after bans were introduced, the company saw an additional 1,700 restaurants come onto their platform. This includes higher-end restaurants, and those which in the non-coronavirus-period typically had long lines of customers waiting outside their doors, such as Melbourne's Chin Chin.

Ikaria wariootia lived during the Ediacaran period, when much of central Australia was under water. Fossils of it were found at Nilpena in South Australia's Flinders Ranges and studies published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed it was the earliest known bilaterian. Humans and most animals are bilaterians because they are symmetrical, have a mouth, an anus and a through-gut. Mary Droser, a geologist from the University of California-Riverside, said the discovery shed new light on the earliest period of history.

Professor Droser, who has done extensive research in the Flinders Ranges, said the world would have looked very different half a billion years ago.

Scientists knew an animal lived during the Ediacaran period and grazed on pond scum long before the Ikaria wariootia fossil was discovered. That's because the marks it made in the ground while moving and eating the scum had left a trail, which after millions of years became a trace fossil. ""Palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists had long accepted that whatever made this trail was a bilaterian,"" Professor Droser said.

Now a children's book author, Blake is creating lead female lead characters who work in male-dominated industries, like science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields, to encourage young girls into new career paths from an early age. ""When I was skiing, it made sense, because it seemed like I was doing stupid things and girls are too smart to be throwing themselves off jumps and living with stinky boys, and I was always hurting myself,"" she said. ""When I moved into the research field, I noticed there were less girls there too and even fewer in technology — something wasn't adding up."" Blake said she could see the problem started with girls from a young age. Girls were simply not even considering a career in a STEM field because they assumed they were jobs for men. ""We go all the way back to before girls have started school, and by the age of six, girls are less likely than boys to believe members of their gender are really smart,"" she said. ""When you ask kids to draw a scientist, two thirds of children aged 9 to 11 draw a man.""   Blake and her co-author, Deborah Ho have, made a concerted choice to feature women in lead roles in their Talu Tales children's books. The first instalment features a female astronaut, the second a marine biologist and an archaeologist in the third.   ""Today, only 11 per cent of space explorers are women,"" Blake said. ""So not only do we see an overwhelming minority, space is such an awesome thing to look at and anyone can look up — it's a gateway science."" She hopes the books will normalise women doing STEM jobs, so when girls start considering their options, they do not have gender stereotypes in mind. ""Play and storytelling play an important role in showing young kids who they can be and what's normal,"" Blake said. ""In the children's literature space, there are a lot of gendered play games and only one fifth of best-selling children's books feature women in the lead. ""We see that as a big problem in limiting girls' beliefs in their ability at a young age."" Annabel Blake says there is a ""leaky pipeline"" as girls slowly drop out of careers in STEM as they grow older, and by the time they are choosing their own subjects at high school, the gender imbalance is obvious.

Macinley Butson is one of Australia's most promising young scientists, currently planning for a clinical hospital trial of a protective shield she has developed for breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. She said while she was brought up in a supportive family featuring scientists and a librarian, there is a need for STEM role models for young girls. ""We've been brought up with a preconceived idea that it's [science] a male job and your scientist is an old guy with white frizzy hair in a lab coat,"" Ms Butson said. ""It can be a bit of fun, but it can potentially lead to women being more afraid to go into STEM. ""If we can have a little bit of exposure to these young minds at that age and challenge the status quo, those ideas will stick with them and it might be that one book that had a character that inspired them.

""We've been brought up with a preconceived idea that it's [science] a male job and your scientist is an old guy with white frizzy hair in a lab coat,"" Ms Butson said. ""It can be a bit of fun, but it can potentially lead to women being more afraid to go into STEM. ""If we can have a little bit of exposure to these young minds at that age and challenge the status quo, those ideas will stick with them and it might be that one book that had a character that inspired them.  ""Even that one role model can make such a difference, so I think it's incredible what Annabel [Blake] is doing and doing intentionally, and giving girls role models to push into whatever field they want to be in.""",ABC Illawarra      By Justin Huntsdale,"April 03, 2020"

Downloads of group-video app Houseparty surged in recent weeks as friends and family members, in a coronavirus-lockdown world, sought to move their IRL relationships online. But now Houseparty is facing a wave of deletions following rumours the platform is compromising users' data security. Here's what you need to know. In the past day, Twitter has been full of users claiming their Spotify, PayPal and iCloud accounts have been compromised and blaming Houseparty for the breach, though without proof.  Some share screenshots of notifications from those other apps alerting the user to a new, potentially suspicious log-in. Epic Games, which owns the app, said the claims Houseparty was responsible for this were inaccurate. ""We've found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,"" a spokesperson told the ABC. PayPal said no accounts globally had been compromised. In any case, ""how to delete Houseparty account"" became the number one worldwide trending search term on Google in the 24 hours to Wednesday morning after posts urging users to ditch the app spread quickly. The app's developers are now offering a $US1 million ($1.6 million) reward for proof of what it suspects was a ""paid commercial smear campaign"".   Epic Games said in a statement to the ABC that its investigation had found many of the original tweets spreading the claims had been deleted or the accounts suspended. However, others remain online. Houseparty said earlier this week ""all Houseparty accounts are safe"". ""The service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn't collect passwords for other sites,"" it said. Paul Haskell-Dowland, the associate dean for computing and security in the School of Science at Edith Cowan University, said users should not be concerned the app had compromised their data security.   ""The likelihood is this is not a breach of any kind of the Houseparty app,"" he told the ABC. ""If indeed there were, with an organisation behind it like Epic Games, it's very likely that that would have been addressed very quickly and they would be taking preventative measures and indeed reaching out to people to inform them.""   He also said that it was very unlikely a company with a reputation like Epic's would intentionally introduce a backdoor into its platform that would allow it to compromise other services on a user's device. Lukas Stefanko, from cybersecurity firm ESET, told Forbes the app ""doesn't provide a lot of in-app options and settings, which creates less scenarios for exploiting security issues"". Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said it was either going to be an example of a commercial smear, as Houseparty alleged, or a case where a handful of users had been compromised, possibly because of what is known as a credential stuffing attack. That is where log-in details for users have ended up on a database following a prior hack like the one that hit Canva last year. Criminals then simply use bots to try those passwords out on other apps, like Houseparty, working on the assumption many people re-use passwords across platforms. Deleting your account will not help you if someone actually has gained access to accounts other than your Houseparty one. Still, Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said uninstalling the app was the obvious solution if people were concerned about an app's security. To do that: As a standard protective measure, you should never use the same password for all your platforms, particularly if you are still using something like ""password1"" or ""12345"". Instead, use a password manager, which generates strong log-ins for all your platforms, and consider two-factor authentication. ""I am using 1Password and I have got over 350 unique passwords stored within that system,"" Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said. ""Should a particular set of credentials get lost or stolen, then it is only going to affect that one service.""",By music and pop culture reporter Paul Donoughue,"April 03, 2020"

But now Houseparty is facing a wave of deletions following rumours the platform is compromising users' data security. Here's what you need to know. In the past day, Twitter has been full of users claiming their Spotify, PayPal and iCloud accounts have been compromised and blaming Houseparty for the breach, though without proof.  Some share screenshots of notifications from those other apps alerting the user to a new, potentially suspicious log-in. Epic Games, which owns the app, said the claims Houseparty was responsible for this were inaccurate. ""We've found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,"" a spokesperson told the ABC. PayPal said no accounts globally had been compromised. In any case, ""how to delete Houseparty account"" became the number one worldwide trending search term on Google in the 24 hours to Wednesday morning after posts urging users to ditch the app spread quickly. The app's developers are now offering a $US1 million ($1.6 million) reward for proof of what it suspects was a ""paid commercial smear campaign"".   Epic Games said in a statement to the ABC that its investigation had found many of the original tweets spreading the claims had been deleted or the accounts suspended. However, others remain online. Houseparty said earlier this week ""all Houseparty accounts are safe"". ""The service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn't collect passwords for other sites,"" it said. Paul Haskell-Dowland, the associate dean for computing and security in the School of Science at Edith Cowan University, said users should not be concerned the app had compromised their data security.   ""The likelihood is this is not a breach of any kind of the Houseparty app,"" he told the ABC. ""If indeed there were, with an organisation behind it like Epic Games, it's very likely that that would have been addressed very quickly and they would be taking preventative measures and indeed reaching out to people to inform them.""   He also said that it was very unlikely a company with a reputation like Epic's would intentionally introduce a backdoor into its platform that would allow it to compromise other services on a user's device. Lukas Stefanko, from cybersecurity firm ESET, told Forbes the app ""doesn't provide a lot of in-app options and settings, which creates less scenarios for exploiting security issues"". Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said it was either going to be an example of a commercial smear, as Houseparty alleged, or a case where a handful of users had been compromised, possibly because of what is known as a credential stuffing attack. That is where log-in details for users have ended up on a database following a prior hack like the one that hit Canva last year. Criminals then simply use bots to try those passwords out on other apps, like Houseparty, working on the assumption many people re-use passwords across platforms. Deleting your account will not help you if someone actually has gained access to accounts other than your Houseparty one. Still, Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said uninstalling the app was the obvious solution if people were concerned about an app's security. To do that: As a standard protective measure, you should never use the same password for all your platforms, particularly if you are still using something like ""password1"" or ""12345"". Instead, use a password manager, which generates strong log-ins for all your platforms, and consider two-factor authentication. ""I am using 1Password and I have got over 350 unique passwords stored within that system,"" Associate Professor Haskell-Dowland said. ""Should a particular set of credentials get lost or stolen, then it is only going to affect that one service.""",By music and pop culture reporter Paul Donoughue,"April 03, 2020"

The Federal Government last month said it would fund 100 such private practice clinics around the country to assess and help people with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19.

Despite most sports postponing or ending their seasons, Racing and Wagering Western Australia (RWWA) said racing would proceed, albeit with stringent measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Earlier in March, racing officials around the country moved to continue meetings behind closed doors, with only essential participants allowed to attend such as stewards, trainers, jockeys and staff needed for on-course operations. Several race meetings are scheduled for WA this week despite regional travel restrictions coming into effect from midnight Tuesday. RWWA said because exemptions applied to people travelling for employment, it believed persons essential for racing would be exempt. Managing director for racing Charlotte Mills said it was in the interest of the animals' welfare to continue racing.  ""The point of difference I'd make very clearly is that we have a lot of animals under people who are employees' care — we have thoroughbreds, standardbreds and greyhounds,"" she said.  ""At the point of which racing would shut down, the care of those animals and the welfare of those animals is something we're contemplating at this time.  ""These animals are bred to race, and while horses can spell and dogs can be in kennels for a period of time, it's the ability for them to come back into the racing environment at a suitable time and the support that's given to provide that opportunity.""     Ms Mills said RWWA was adhering to strict social distancing requirements. ""It's actually a moving dynamic of people because they're there for a race and then they leave,"" she said. ""We are spacing out stalls, spacing out kennels, and we are asking people to race their animal and then leave the track."" She said, on average, there would be 80 people at a time on the track. ""But it's quite a large, open space as you'd appreciate at a racetrack.""     But Andrew Miller, president of the AMA's WA branch, said it was a disappointing decision and that horse racing ""should be put on hold to respect the rest of the community"".  ""It's very difficult to understand why you would send such mixed messages to the public when we're asking for everyone to stay at home at the moment,"" he said. ""I don't see why the horse racing can't wait; it seems like the kind of sport that can wait until we get what is a humanitarian health crisis under control."" Dr Miller said he believed it would be difficult for jockeys and staff at the racetracks to adhere to social distancing rules.   ""As soon as people get together, and travel, and be in other places than at home, then the virus can more easily spread,"" he said. ""We need to do everything we can to delay the spread so we can save lives, not just for the elderly and the vulnerable, but also for the fit and the health workers."" Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia said the State Government was going to ""work through the detail of the restrictions and is working with RWWA to define how they might apply to the racing industry"".

Residents in the South West, home to some of the state's most popular tourist towns, say people from Perth and surrounds have ignored calls by the State Government to cancel unnecessary travel to the region. People in Dunsborough, Margaret River and surrounding towns said they had noticed an influx of out-of-towners. They also said people who owned holiday homes had seemingly chosen to bunker down there instead of Perth. The influx has left residents furious and raised concerns about added pressure on limited regional health resources.     Regional travel restrictions start at midnight to stop the spread of coronavirus. Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said people who owned holiday homes were not exempt from the rules. ""If you've got a principal home in Perth, stay in your principal home,"" he said. ""If you think you can just holiday back and forward at will, you're not actually recognising that you are in a state of emergency."" WA Country Health Service chief operating officer Margaret Denton said people travelling to regional towns needed to consider the impact it would have on local communities and country hospitals.

""We all need to work together to slow the spread of COVID-19, and this type of behaviour is counterproductive."" Terry Redman, the Member for Warren-Blackwood, said the South West had limited health resources, and although towns were reliant on tourists, now was not the time to travel.   ""I'm deeply disappointed that people are seemingly going to make the decision to move to the South West, particularly following the advice we've got,"" he said. ""The South West and Great Southern is as ready as they can be with the resources they have. ""What they don't want, and what they can ill afford, is to have an influx of people, which puts much more pressure on those limited resources that they do have."" Shire of Augusta-Margaret River president Ian Earl said many of the grey nomads in his community would usually travel north for warmer weather at this time of year. But with the advice for elderly people to isolate at home, many were still in the South West.

Twenty years ago the South Australian spent 140 days in a Russian space station confined to a small space, breathing the same air with the same people 24 hours a day, seven days a week — and he remembered the challenges well. ""When I went up I thought 'this is going to be a tough duty',"" Mr Thomas said. But it turned out not to be as bad as he first expected. ""I thought I'd be crossing off days on the calendar, but it turned out to be a really good experience,"" he said.   Mr Thomas said there were two big milestones to conquer to get your basic needs met. ""You have to have a food plan,"" he said.  ""Understand where the food is, how to get what you need for basic nutrition and, if you're a homeowner, I imagine you'll have to figure out a plan for your family."" Then you need a plan for personal hygiene. ""Figuring out how to maintain a personal hygiene plan in the face of social isolation is also important,"" Mr Thomas said. He said it is important to have access to soap and individual towels, as well as washing consistency.     Mr Thomas was based on Mir Space Station, which operated in low Earth orbit from 1986-2001. He looks back on that time now with great fondness. ""It was one of the most peaceful times in my life,"" Mr Thomas said. ""Once you find that balance where you're producing useful work, meaningful work and your recreation is fulfilling, then the experience of confinement can be tranquil, serene."" The team onboard consisted of Thomas and two Russian cosmonauts, who spent 20 weeks together in zero gravity. ""We got on well. The space station was big enough so that if I ever needed some private time or some personal time I could find a place where I could be quiet,"" Mr Thomas said. Mr Thomas believes people who are socially isolating should take advantage of teleworking — working online to stay connected to other employees and work systems whilst working from home. ""If you can't telework you'll have to find other things to do around the house,"" he said.     Mr Thomas said routine was especially important when you are working from home, and recommended finding meaningful work and scheduling yourself to be productive each day. ""A day-to-day routine is what sustains us,"" Mr Thomas said. ""We (normally) have a five-day work week with two days for weekend, and I think it's good to maintain that, even if you're not able to go to work."" He said that social distancing did not mean you had to socially isolate yourself.   ""It's important for people who are socially isolated not to withdraw completely, but maintain contact through social media,"" Mr Thomas said. The astronaut strongly advised against lying on the sofa and binge watching television. ""What you need to avoid is sitting down and binge watching Netflix, instead you want to use social media productively and maintain physical activity, finding a balance between what your body needs — which is food, nutrition, hygiene and exercise,"" Mr Thomas said. ""Then focus on what your mind needs, which is work and recreation.""   ""I think the challenge for people now is the same challenge astronauts face, and that's how to be resourceful when you have limited opportunities and limited options available to you,"" Mr Thomas said. Mr Thomas stressed the importance of taking time for yourself. ""When you're in a confined environment and nothing changes, you have to take time to enjoy yourself a bit more,"" he said. When Mr Thomas was in the space station, he spent his recreation time watching movies, exercising and doing sketches, which he said found very rewarding, despite the challenges of doing it in zero gravity — something those of us on Earth do not have to worry about.

38,/news/2020-03-29/coronavirus-and-problem-gambling/12095714?section=technology,Gamblers in coronavirus isolation turn to betting on reality TV and even Russian table tennis,"With casinos shut and major sports cancelling or postponing their seasons, bookmakers and gambling sites are still finding ways to reach problem gamblers, experts have warned.   In the place of major sporting events provided by such codes as the AFL and NBA, more niche sports are already being marketed, according to Deakin gambling expert, Professor Samantha Thomas. ""Today in my Twitter feed, there was a promotion for table tennis overseas and when I clicked on that link, it took me to betting markets for a table tennis match in Russia,"" Dr Thomas said. ""This is from an Australian bookmaker and I anticipate that we'll see a lot more of those exotic markets, or more obscure international markets, being promoted because they're the only markets that are open at the moment.   ""Just because sporting matches have stopped in Australia, it doesn't mean that the marketing has stopped and we're definitely still seeing marketing from online gambling companies on television and particularly through social media."" Dr Thomas says the group she is most concerned about is young men, who are traditionally targeted by bookmakers. She wants to see more measures in place to protect them, including banning gambling on credit cards, routinely used to top up gambling accounts. ""Now would be a really good time to fast-track some of those measures to make sure that people are protected at this time,"" she said.     As well as niche sports, Esports, like competitive videogaming, have not faced the same slump as physical gambling. Sally Gainsbury, Associate Professor and co-director of the gambling treatment and research clinic at the University of Sydney, said novelty stakes could also gain popularity in the absence of anything else. ""There are other events that can be bet on — anything from reality TV to the weather to political betting, or other key decisions in society, so there will be options for betting,"" Dr Gainsbury said. ""People are going to be looking for something to fill that void, now if that is betting then they may switch to something different.

39,/news/2020-03-29/coronavirus-and-problem-gambling/12095714?section=technology,Gamblers in coronavirus isolation turn to betting on reality TV and even Russian table tennis,"With casinos shut and major sports cancelling or postponing their seasons, bookmakers and gambling sites are still finding ways to reach problem gamblers, experts have warned.   In the place of major sporting events provided by such codes as the AFL and NBA, more niche sports are already being marketed, according to Deakin gambling expert, Professor Samantha Thomas. ""Today in my Twitter feed, there was a promotion for table tennis overseas and when I clicked on that link, it took me to betting markets for a table tennis match in Russia,"" Dr Thomas said. ""This is from an Australian bookmaker and I anticipate that we'll see a lot more of those exotic markets, or more obscure international markets, being promoted because they're the only markets that are open at the moment.   ""Just because sporting matches have stopped in Australia, it doesn't mean that the marketing has stopped and we're definitely still seeing marketing from online gambling companies on television and particularly through social media."" Dr Thomas says the group she is most concerned about is young men, who are traditionally targeted by bookmakers. She wants to see more measures in place to protect them, including banning gambling on credit cards, routinely used to top up gambling accounts. ""Now would be a really good time to fast-track some of those measures to make sure that people are protected at this time,"" she said.     As well as niche sports, Esports, like competitive videogaming, have not faced the same slump as physical gambling. Sally Gainsbury, Associate Professor and co-director of the gambling treatment and research clinic at the University of Sydney, said novelty stakes could also gain popularity in the absence of anything else. ""There are other events that can be bet on — anything from reality TV to the weather to political betting, or other key decisions in society, so there will be options for betting,"" Dr Gainsbury said. ""People are going to be looking for something to fill that void, now if that is betting then they may switch to something different. ""What we don't know is the extent to which regular punters will switch over to these other types of betting, whether they'll reduce their betting or switch to some other form of gambling entirely.""

The consortium of Huawei Australia and UGL (HUGL) won the tender in July 2018 to upgrade the radio communications system for Perth's urban rail network. The plan had involved building about 80 radio masts and base stations throughout the metropolitan network and replacing radio devices in trains, security vehicles and handheld radios. But both parties have now mutually agreed not to continue the current arrangement.  In a statement, WA's Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said the HUGL consortium had earlier provided the State Government assurances that it could deliver the project in light of trade restrictions imposed by the US Government.   However, further restrictions imposed in August 2019 had led to a ""force majeure"" event which both companies could not overcome. The State Government said the measures required to overcome the situation would result in unacceptable uncertainty around the total cost of the project and completion time, while there was no guarantee the solution would be effective. ""It is extremely unfortunate that the State Government's project — which is limited to a radio network for train drivers and transit guards — has been caught up in the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China,"" Ms Saffioti said. ""The PTA will continue its plans to deliver a new digital radio system for our expanding public transport system."" Ms Saffioti said the decision was made before taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coronavirus is spreading rapidly through regional Victoria with 85 positive cases confirmed on Friday afternoon and potential hotspots building around Greater Geelong, Ballarat, and South Gippsland. But because the current testing criteria only allows a small number of people to be tested, with a particular focus on returned travellers, a true picture of how the disease is spreading is not clear. DHHS said in a statement that it had requested screening clinics across Victoria begin testing one in five people who presented at their clinics on top of testing those who met the criteria. ""This will give us a better picture of whether COVID-19 is circulating more broadly in the community,"" the statement said. ""To date it has been identified in returned travellers or close contacts of returned travellers.""       Bendigo hospital in Central Victoria was one of the first regional clinics to implement the expanded testing regime. So far only two people have tested positive at the hospital's clinic, and CEO Peter Faulkner hoped the expanded testing would give them a clearer picture of how the disease was spreading locally.  ""We've commenced a program of testing every fifth presentation to our screening clinic in an effort to identify COVID-19 that may not yet be symptomatic, and to try and identify what the prevalence is across our community generally,"" he said. Professor Bill Bowtell from the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity said gathering more detailed localised data was a big step forward. ""It's interesting to have the national figures and even the state figures, but it's town by town and city by city that gives us the best chance to see this thing off with the least disruption and the least illness or death,"" he said. ""Where [towns] say, 'Well we've got this many people, let's move swiftly so the cluster doesn't get into our community', those places really record tremendous results."" Mr Bowtell said randomised testing worked similarly to opinion polling. ""If you look at a sample size of, say, 500 or so, that will give you a pretty good indication of what's happening in the broader community around Bendigo,"" he said. ""And as you would expect if you get facts and figures, that really really helps.""     A number of other regional hospitals, including in Wangaratta, Albury Wodonga and Swan Hill, have also begun testing every fifth person who presents at their clinics.  Ballarat Hospital will begin the expanded testing regime at a new clinic from Monday.

44,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-data-australia-growth-factor-covid-19/12132478,One coronavirus number will let us know if Australia's outbreak is getting worse,"The vast array of data on the coronavirus pandemic can feel overwhelming, as we all try to make sense of how fast COVID-19 is spreading around the world and the relentless daily count of new cases and deaths. Helpfully, there's one number that can tell us quickly and clearly whether the coronavirus outbreak is getting better or worse. It's called the growth factor. The main thing to understand is this — to be sure we're staying on top of the outbreak, we must keep this number below one. And here is how the growth factor for Australia's outbreak currently looks.   Put simply, the growth factor measures how fast the number of new cases is going up or down. And here's the key point: Calculating the daily growth factor is as simple as taking today's new reported cases and dividing it by yesterday's new cases. Because these numbers can be a little volatile, we're using a five-day moving average of new cases for our calculations.   Of course, the growth factor will change over time. Even though Australia's current growth factor is below one — meaning there were fewer new cases today than there were yesterday — that could change. But for now at least, things are headed in the right direction. Australia looks to be successfully flattening the curve but as public health officials keep reminding us, the fight against coronavirus is likely to be a long one. Even if the number of people sick with COVID-19 gets quite low, the virus could start spreading quickly again without ongoing vigilance. [Want to see how Australia's growth factor compares to the US, the UK and other countries around the world? Keep reading, or skip ahead.] A figure like this is only ever as good as the data being collected. So when reading the growth factor, there are two extra parameters to keep in mind: community transmission and testing. The number of coronavirus cases originating overseas is starting to decrease drastically at the moment, and there's a risk those falling numbers could hide something more worrying — a smaller but rising number of cases caused by spread by community transmission. Experts say the rate of that local spread may be a better indicator of just how well our physical distancing measures are working. It's been difficult to compile data on community transmission. So far, the data we do have only starts in April. It shows little difference in the growth factors for imported cases and local spread. However, there are about 89 cases still 'under investigation', meaning their origin remains unclear.   Another question mark around the data is testing. We will only find cases where we look for them and much of Australia's testing has been focused on people arriving from overseas and their close contacts. Even though Australia has tested a high proportion of the population by international standards, Catherine Bennett, the chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, says our high testing rate and low positive rate are a ""red herring"".   ""If you're not testing the increasing number of people with symptoms in the community, then you only see what you test for. ""If we can look at that in more detail as we do the breakdown [of community transmission] within Australia I think that's going to be helpful, because I do think it ties to the lockdown. The lockdown is all about community acquisition, not about the boats that came in four weeks ago."" The unknown number of undetected cases currently in the community may prove crucial to keeping Australia's outbreak manageable. Several states have announced they're now expanding testing criteria to include a broader cross-section of the community. So it's important to remember that any rise in the growth factor could be, in part, a result of more widespread testing. ""As we expand our testing we expect it to go up but that doesn't necessarily mean community cases are going up, it means that testing is broadening to capture them,"" Professor Bennett said. Finally, it's worth remembering that even though the growth factor is a great litmus test for how well we're keeping Australia's outbreak in check, other numbers are important too. Now that we understand what growth factor means, it can also provide a useful insight into outbreaks around the world — and how different countries are faring in their efforts to bring coronavirus under control. The following charts focus on the countries with the largest overall coronavirus outbreaks around the world, as well as some of Australia's nearest neighbours.             As you compare those global figures, it’s even more important to factor testing regimes into your thinking. If one country is testing a lot and another is testing very little, it’s going to have a major impact on how their growth factors stack up.

45,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-triggers-struggle-between-donald-trump-and-china/12138772,Coronavirus is hurting America's place as a world leader while China appears to rise,"Yesterday in America, 1,940 people died from coronavirus. In a single day, 31,935 new infections were recorded. I personally know five people who have been told they have COVID-19. Only one of them was able to get a test and it came back inconclusive. The rest were told by their doctors ""don't bother"" because there weren't enough test kits to go around. On the testing front, things have improved greatly in recent weeks, but not everywhere.   A New York ambulance paramedic told the ABC this week tests were still hard to come by, even for frontline health workers.   And yet, since the start of the crisis, the President has boasted about America's testing capacity. ""Anyone who needs a test gets a test … and they're beautiful,"" Donald Trump said during a tour of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. That was five weeks ago. In New York, things are looking so dire that prison inmates are being asked to don protective gear as they dig mass graves on Hart Island in the Bronx.   The island has been used for decades to bury New Yorkers with no next of kin or no money to afford a proper funeral.  As COVID-19-related deaths surge, new trenches have been dug to cope with an expected influx of coffins. Furthermore, the official death toll in New York hasn't been counting those who died outside of hospital. On Monday, that was 280 people. So, it's very likely the real number of infections and deaths is much higher than the already-staggering published numbers.   The world is no longer measuring the ""worst-case scenario"" against Wuhan, Italy or Spain. For now, America is the benchmark. A nation accustomed to being a world-beater in business, innovation, sport and on the battlefield, has been reduced to its knees.   American friends have told me they've been shocked by what's happening in their country.   For them, and millions more, it's been a grim awakening. ""It's embarrassing"" said Michael Green, the senior vice-president for Asia at CSIS, a Washington-based think tank. ""The US was not prepared, particularly in terms of masks and basic equipment like ventilators."" America has even turned to its biggest strategic threat, China, for help. In response, China is sending 1,000 ventilators to New York and regular planeloads of other critical protective gear. Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes coronavirus has shattered the ""myth"" of American global supremacy. As a former senior director of strategy at the National Security Council — the President's most important advisory body — he offers a sobering assessment of America's place in the world today. ""I think the myth was that the US was still the main power acting throughout the world,"" he told the ABC.   He describes the current crisis, and America's less-than-optimal response, as a ""wow"" moment for many in Washington. ""All our pharmaceuticals are manufactured in China. All of our masks are manufactured in China. Basically everything is manufactured in China,"" he told ABC. ""We have this incredible logistics capability for deploying [military] forces abroad but it's all dependent on the help of the Chinese Communist Party."" And he sees that as a clear and present threat to the United States. ""We don't have to have a conflict in the traditional sense of the word to actually be threatened by the fact our supply chains are over there [in China]."" China has been extending a helping hand to other nations as well.   When Italy appealed for medical assistance, there was silence from the 26 other nations of the European Union. China answered the call with medical specialists and equipment. Chinese protective gear has also been sent to Ireland, and Serbia has welcomed Chinese ventilators.   Stepping up as a global citizen is a positive development for China. Perhaps it feels a greater burden of responsibility because the coronavirus is thought to have originated there. Michael Green, from CSIS, says China also sees the pandemic as an opportunity to project soft-power in the void created by a more isolationist America.   But he doesn't see a fundamental realignment of global power just yet. ""There may be small tactical gains [for China] here or there. There may be some losses. There's no fundamental shift,"" Mr Green said. He believes the pandemic will result in an intensification of US-China rivalries in the months and years ahead, with America being forced to step up as a global leader once more. Maintaining America's current course, he says, ""will have a tectonic effect on global relations"".   Robert Spalding also believes coronavirus has been a call to arms for America. ""The way we fight this next war over the next 10 years is going to be about rebuilding our country, rebuilding the economic vitality and productivity of it and reinvesting in science and technology."" He sees President Donald Trump's call for a $US2 trillion ($3.2 trillion) investment in infrastructure as a ""righting of the ship"".   ""So you're going to see a much different America coming out of the next five years than the last 20,"" Mr Spalding said. Whatever happens, that much is certain. In a matter of weeks, the pandemic has relentlessly exploited America's weak spots. Inadequate health care, rampant inequality, cumbersome bureaucracy, all-pervasive politics and millions of people who trust shock jocks and preachers more than scientists.   The United States of America is still a great nation. But the coronavirus has blown a hole in its reputation as a world leader. If this disaster can't drive a course correction, perhaps nothing will.    ",By Washington bureau chief David Lipson,"April 10, 2020"
46,/news/2020-04-10/australians-pool-cash-for-coronavirus-flights-out-of-india/12138010,"As coronavirus cases escalate in India, Australians pool their cash to arrange charter flights home","A group of expats and aviation experts have banded together to organise private charter flights to bring home hundreds of Australians stranded in India.   Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the Government for emergency flights.  ""I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,"" Mr Quinn told the ABC. ""People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.""   Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle.   ""But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,"" he said.  India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases.   ""People assume [Australians] hadn't heeded the calls from home,"" Mr Quinn said. ""The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn't."" As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts.  He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation.   Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" Mr Hempel said.   ""I know it's a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. ""I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out."" The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out.    ""[We're] elated, absolutely stoked,"" Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room.   ""We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare."" The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. ""We were nervous that it still wasn't real until we were literally in the car,"" Mr Munro said.   ""When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.""  Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through.  ""I think it should not have been their responsibility,"" he added.  Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx.   Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India's lockdown.   On April 9, Ms Payne said she had spoken with her Indian counterpart about organising a commercial flight to Australia. ""People think it's quite simple that you order charter flights,"" Mr Quinn said.

47,/news/2020-04-10/the-rules-of-driving-during-coronavirus/12132208,Can I drive under coronavirus restrictions? How many passengers? Answering your Easter weekend driving questions,"As the Easter weekend approaches, there is a great temptation to hit the road, but authorities have warned drivers to think carefully before grabbing their keys. Conscious of keeping coronavirus under control, police across the country have redoubled their efforts to crack down on non-essential travel. So what is essential? Can you drive to see a partner or a relative? What about a quick trip to a holiday home or for a leisurely cruise around town? Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings. NSW drivers could spend six months in prison, or be forced to pay $11,000 plus $5,500 per day if they continue to break the rules.

49,/news/2020-04-10/new-york-state-posts-record-coronavirus-death-rise-covid-19/12140380,Burial operations ramp up as New York posts record-breaking rise in coronavirus deaths,"Workers in protective gear are toiling to bury dozens of bodies in mass graves on an island in Long Island Sound, as New York City deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space.   Aerial images showed workers putting coffins into trenches on Hart Island — a 1.5 kilometre-long island off the Bronx where more than a million mostly homeless and poor New Yorkers have been buried over the years. Typically, about 25 bodies a week are buried on the island, mostly for people whose families can't afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Burials are now happening five days a week, with around 24 burials each day, according to the Department of Correction. About 40 coffins were lined up for burial on the island on Thursday, and two fresh trenches had been dug in recent days.   New York continues to be hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with the state posting a record-breaking increase in coronavirus deaths for a third consecutive day on Thursday, even as a surge of patients in overwhelmed hospitals slowed. The number of deaths in the state of New York rose by 799 to more than 7,000, after increases of 779 the day before, and 731 the day before that. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that if the city ran out of morgue space, bodies could be temporarily individually buried on Hart Island and families would be able to reclaim them at a later date. But the city's medical examiner's office said it did not anticipate running out of space in morgues.   New York Governor Andrew Cuomo described Thursday's death count as a lagging indicator, reflecting the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The snapshot of hospitalisations showed a less dire picture.  A net 200-patient increase in hospitalisations was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"", Mr Cuomo said, compared with daily increases of more than 1,000 last week.    More than 18,200 people were in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms on Thursday, and intensive care admissions were also down. ""Today we can say that we have lost many of our brothers and sisters, but we haven't lost anyone because they couldn't get the right and best health care that they could,"" Mr Cuomo said at his daily news briefing. Mr Cuomo and Mr de Blasio used the same metaphor that New York was not ""out of the woods"" yet at successive briefings on Thursday. ""It is good news. 'Well, now I can relax,' No, you can't relax,"" Mr Cuomo cautioned.  ""The flattening of the curve last night happened because of what we did yesterday and the day before and the day before that.""   Mr de Blasio said New York City needed to continue social distancing as well as adding more coronavirus testing capacity before the loosening of restrictions could be considered. ""If we really work hard we have a chance of seeing change in May or June,"" he said.   From Monday the city will release ongoing data on three key virus indicators: the number of people admitted to hospitals and suspected of having COVID-19; the number of intensive care unit admissions for the disease; and the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, Mr de Blasio said. All three numbers would have to go down in unison for 10 days to two weeks before the city could consider loosening social distancing restrictions. But in order to contemplate returning to anything approaching normalcy, the city would also need to be able to test more people for the virus, he added. ""We need some greater capacity,"" he said.  ""I think the Federal Government is still the most important part of this equation when it comes to testing.""   AP/ABC    ",,"April 10, 2020"
50,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-political-debate-turns-to-a-way-out/12140416,Coronavirus political debate turns to a way out while we endure Easter in a virtual monastery,"Remember how last year's Easter felt bizarre because the country was in election mode? How normal that seems, now everything is surreal, with the nation ""holidaying"" in this peculiar, unpleasant limbo. As we contemplate the grimness we should also remember it could be much worse.  It's early days but we've dodged the horror of Italy, France, Britain, and the US. So far in Australia, the virus is being contained, the ""curve"" of new cases flattened.   Nevertheless, this Easter millions of Australians see little but uncertainty ahead, as they worry about their health, their jobs or lack or them, their businesses. The economic fear inevitably remains dialled high despite a trimmed-down Parliament (only 50-plus House of Representatives MPs out of 151) on Wednesday passing the government's $130 billion wage subsidy package.   Earlier in the week, Scott Morrison had received a Newspoll bounce in his approval, just as Kevin Rudd did in the global financial crisis. Bad as the GFC was, it's clear this crisis will be much more fraught to exit. We are only just into the restrictions but already the debate is intensifying about how and when we get out of them — a result of the relatively good news and people's natural impatience. The question occupying cooped-up households, half-dead businesses, and anxious governments (and their health advisers) is: what now? The immediate answer is simple. We need to endure Easter in a virtual monastery.  When Health Minister Greg Hunt says ""this in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus"", it is likely only a minor exaggeration. The longer term answer to ""what now"" will involve practical and ethical judgements, and contested views.     The exit strategy is uppermost in Morrison's mind — he has always bracketed ""livelihoods"" (aka the economy) with ""lives"" in his language. We're not going to jump from where we are now to that ""other side"" he and others talk about.  We will walk on a long perilous journey requiring complex decisions about steps and timing, with the risk of serious mistakes, and the certainty of pain. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says: ""We are on a life raft. We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft.""  The national cabinet has asked its health experts for navigational advice. But the issue always comes back to the health-economics balance. The much-anticipated modelling the government has released didn't provide much of a compass. It told us the obvious: if we'd let the epidemic rip — which we were never going to — the health system would have been overwhelmed. The present policy is one of ""suppressing"" the virus — isolating cases, tracking contacts. Morrison believes it would be too costly to aim to eliminate COVID-19 here — the New Zealand route.   So the future choice is between attempted continued containment until there is a vaccine — a big operation in testing and tracing — or pursuing some form of ""herd immunity"".  The latter would allow the virus to move through the community (while protecting the most vulnerable).   The herd immunity path (there'd be a nicer name) would be very controversial and take more lives than attempting to maintain the suppression approach. Asked on Thursday whether it was possible, when we do unwind the various restrictions, to simultaneously pursue a suppression policy, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said: ""It's entirely possible, and that would need to be the aim. … The suppression strategy needs to be sustainable in the medium term whilst we work out things like when a vaccine becomes available, whilst we bring new molecules online to be able to treat the virus."" What is important as discussion gets underway about lifting some restrictions is that we get transparency on the health advice. This is being promised, but it's no good having modelling long after decisions are made.   There has been more than a dash of ""we know best"" in how the Government has explained things so far.  ""We're acting on medical advice"", it has said, to justify this or that measure.  But the official health advice has sometimes appeared less than consistent, and been criticised by some experts. Morrison has canvassed easing restrictions on a patchwork basis, first in places where and when it seems safest to do so. Those places would in effect be trials for elsewhere. This is logical but won't be easy.  If combined with the continuation of the suppression policy, governments must be willing to reimpose controls if case numbers increase again. And strict health protocols should be in place for how businesses and organisations deal with fresh cases. A present challenge is to manage the pressures from stakeholders and the community for an easing timetable. Innes Willox, chief of the Australian Industry Group, wrote this week in The Australian: ""We need a path back to getting the economy going again. … Businesses owners and their backers will quickly change direction, make other arrangements or move on if they don't have some hope or sense that the current restrictions aren't limitless.""   After an initial period when anyone who criticised the Government was likely to be attacked for betraying ""Team Australia"", a degree of political normality is returning, at a muted level.  Anthony Albanese has become more outspoken, and this week the Senate set up a Labor-chaired committee to examine the Government's response to the pandemic. On the current timetable, the Parliament is not due to meet again until August. The parliamentary hiatus is one restriction which is unnecessary and undesirable. Morrison says all who have jobs are essential workers. Federal parliamentarians have jobs and part of their remit is to hold regular collective deliberations in Canberra.  It's time they got back to doing so, with provisions for appropriate distancing. One-day dashes are not enough.

51,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-restrictions-fines-disobey-the-law-your-rights/12140644,Coronavirus restrictions mean on-the-spot fines if you disobey the law. These are your rights,"The message to everyone during the coronavirus pandemic is to stay at home and only leave if you really need to for, say, food, health care or exercise. Police now have powers to issue on-the-spot fines to people for breaches of public health orders as part of the coronavirus restrictions. Hundreds of fines have already been issued in many states, for example: Victorian police also pulled over and fined a 17-year-old learner driver for ""non-essential travel"", but later withdrew the fine. This last case shows penalty notices can be overturned. So, what should you do if you have been issued with a notice by police, especially if you think you have been unfairly fined?   Penalty notice schemes allow police to swiftly impose a fixed fine and avoid prosecuting the matter in court. Police and politicians tend to describe their benefit as reducing red tape and cutting costs. But many Australians are unaware of their rights and options if they receive a penalty notice. The following information is not intended to replace independent legal advice. You should also check your state or territory's rules and procedures.   Check the notice for the payment due date.  If you are experiencing financial hardship and cannot pay the fine, contact the fines administration agency to see if you can request an extension or ask to pay by instalments.     The directions of some COVID-19 orders are vague and have been hastily drafted. Many Australians are struggling to keep up with what's allowed and what isn't. Police have also had insufficient time and training to understand the orders, including what constitutes a reasonable excuse. This can give rise to arbitrary — and perhaps incorrect — interpretations of the provisions. You can request an independent review of the police officer's decision to issue a penalty notice. The request should be directed to the relevant fines administration agency before the penalty due date.   If successful, your penalty notice may be withdrawn or you could receive a caution in place of the fine. Grounds for a review may include: Review processes often allow you to provide copies of evidence to support your claim, such as photos and documents. If you disagree with the findings of the independent reviewer you can elect to go to court. A court may find you guilty or not guilty. If convicted of the offence, you may be liable for a larger fine and imprisonment for up to six months. You should seek legal advice if you intend to go to court. The right to seek an independent review or go to court is rarely exercised. As the NSW Law Reform Commission observed in 2012: The penalty notice system does not have the transparency normally associated with justice systems in democratic societies … Most people simply pay the penalty. Only 1 per cent elect to go to court, so that the guilt or innocence of the recipient is rarely scrutinised. If you don't pay the fine by the due date, you will usually be given a reminder notice and may incur additional financial penalties. If you still do not pay the fine by the extended due date, you may receive fines enforcement sanctions, including driver licence or vehicle registration suspension or cancellation, or property seizure.   In the rush to quickly enforce social distancing and social isolation rules, the flaws of on-the-spot fines regimes have received little attention. They do not punish everyone equally. A wealthy person is much less likely to feel the weight of a $1,000 fine — and suffer the consequences of fines enforcement sanctions — than someone who is unemployed or has had their income drastically reduced.   There is also insufficient evidence of the deterrent effect of penalty notices, particularly on those who do not understand the law or what they did wrong, those who are too poor to pay the fine or, alternatively, those who are so wealthy that the fine has a negligible impact. An important aspect of the rule of law is that citizens are made aware of the law so they can moderate their behaviour to comply with it. The speed at which the COVID-19 orders have been introduced, their breadth and their arbitrary interpretation by individual police officers can result in people unwittingly breaching the law and being unfairly punished.

52,/news/2020-04-10/gardening-australia-costa-georgiadis-tips-for-covid-19-isolation/12132902,Gardening Australia's Costa Georgiadis shares four tips for living in coronavirus isolation,"Costa Georgiadis's chooks are pretty happy right now. Like the rest of Australia, the gardening guru is spending a lot more time at home and, unsurprisingly, in his backyard. ""They're spending a lot more time in the broader garden and actually out on the street as I do work on my street garden,"" he said. ""Their definition of lockdown is free range."" These are troubling times, but for Costa there is ""a big silver lining"", and that's seeing how many people are getting back into their gardens.   So to help you make the most of it, Costa has some ideas on everything from what to plant now to how many chooks you can have (if you can find them), and what to do if you live in an apartment. First of all, Costa wants you to just take a moment to get to know your garden.   ""It's really such a special time in the sense that without the pressures of having to go anywhere, there's this chance to slow down,"" he said. ""One of the smallest and simplest things from a gardening point of view is to actually go out into your garden and just observe what's going on."" It might sound basic, but Costa says most of the time we're just moving through the space — taking the bins out or watering the plants while staring at our phones. So he wants you to try these simple ideas: In other words, look at your garden as a living thing, rather than just a space. ""I talk to children about doing that, but I equally share it with adults because there's so much going on in our gardens that we tend to miss,"" Costa said. There are a lot of things that can go into the ground at the moment. The typically cooler parts of the country haven't yet become too cold, and the hotter northern areas are now starting to become more mild. ""So there's this wonderful, almost spring window,"" Costa said.  ""As far as gardening goes and growing, this is one of the prime slots similar to when we come out in in early spring."" Here are a few options to plant now:   Some of these are quick turnaround and you will be able to start ""repeat havesting"" within 30-50 days. That is, picking off outer leaves and leaving the rest to continue growing. Then you can turn to longer-term vegetables like snow peas, broad beans, broccoli and cauliflower.  ""There's things that we can wait for the full term and there's other things that we can harvest along the way, and those salad greens are a great place to start,"" Costa said. A lack of space doesn't have to mean a lack of garden, and there is still plenty you can grow. Just get experimental, Costa says.   ""Get your celery or your spinach or even your Asian greens, cut them off from the base with about two centimetres or so, then put them on the window sill in a little bit of water,"" he said. ""Things like spring onions — and I've got it going on at the moment with some silverbeet — they'll reshoot and you can literally watch them start growing from the central core. ""Then once they get up a bit and you see little roots you can go out and plant them into the soil and it's just a nice little project."" Other things you can grow in jars on your window sill include mung beans and lentils. Costa says there's no shortage of online tutorials for sprouts. ""That's a great little science project for the kids.""   Costa's chooks like a bit of gardening themselves, especially when he tries to put the mulch out. ""They didn't go to the school of colouring in between the lines, they spread the mulch outside the garden beds,"" he said. ""But hey, they're happy.""   If you're looking to buy some chickens, chances are you're not alone. At the same time there was a run on toilet paper, chicken breeders around the country were also being inundated. If you do want to get some chooks consider how you will keep them. ""You can have a pre-made coop and some of them come on wheels, so you can actually move them across the yard so that they're not fixed in one point,"" Costa said.   In terms of space, Costa says a smaller coop is OK as long as the chickens have space they can be let out to roam around in. About 10 square metres is a good guide. ""That would be enough to have a couple of chickens, and it's always nice to have two rather than one so they've got some company,"" he said.    ",ABC News Breakfast,"April 10, 2020"
53,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-claiming-tax-rent-mortgage/12135048,Coronavirus is changing how we claim tax this year. But what about rent or mortgage?,"If your office is now at home, you may be wondering: does this mean I can claim my rent or mortgage at tax time? In an effort to get you through uncharted waters, we recently published this piece on what you can claim when working from home. With many of us now sharing our work space with our kids, our cats and our dirty dishes, the ATO has introduced a new, simpler method for people to make claims at tax time. It's an 80-cents-per-hour method, which includes all running expenses like the phone, power bills, heating and cooling. But many of you sent through some questions about particular household items. You were worried that if you claimed any home office expenses now that you might have to pay more tax when it comes time to sell your property. So we went back to our experts to find out.   So now that your work space and living space has combined, can you also claim your rent or the interest on your mortgage? Well, it's complicated. But in general, no.   That's because in most cases, your house isn't the main office, studio or place of business, says Andrew Gardiner, spokesperson for the National Tax and Accountants' Association. ""This is the case even though you might be highly encouraged or forced to work from home when dealing with the coronavirus crisis,"" he said. The main exception is if you legitimately run your small business from a dedicated space in your home or your employer does not provide you with an office or work station at their business premises. ""The classic example would be someone who runs a hairdressing salon out of part of their house and they have it dedicated for that purpose,"" Mr Gardiner said. But even then, you can't claim your total rent or the full amount of your interest on your mortgage. You can still only claim a portion, worked out by calculating the floor area of the business space compared to the total property size. Many people sent questions into us, worried that if they made any home office claims, they might get a sting in the tail when it comes time to sell their home — meaning they might have to pay capital gains tax.   Capital gains tax is basically a tax that you pay to the Government when you make a profit on an investment — usually a property or shares. You don't usually have to pay capital gains tax when you sell the home that you live in — it's called the main residence exemption. Fortunately, even if you make claims for home office expenses like the internet, phone, heating and cooling, you won't have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the family home, tax accountant Paula Hart says. ""Capital gains only comes into effect when you are running your business from home, or not provided with an office or work station by your employer,"" she said.   So, if you run your hair salon out of a room in your house, you may have to pay some capital gains tax when it comes time to sell your family home. In that case, she says it's important to keep good records on ""the date you purchased the property, the date you started or stopped using the property to produce income"". ""Even if you stopped using the property as your principal place of business,"" she added. This is where it gets a little bit tricky. Mr Gardiner says it can be hard to prove you're running a legitimate small business when it might just be classified as a hobby. ""[The ATO] has become even more aggressive again when you're also a full-time employee,"" he warned.   So be careful when trying to claim a deduction for rent or the interest on your mortgage if you're running a side hustle out of your front room. He says the advantage of not claiming the rent or interest on your mortgage is that you probably won't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell. When it comes to making claims, the tax office has three golden rules. ""Taxpayers must have spent the money themselves and not have been reimbursed, the claim must be directly related to earning income and there must be a record to substantiate the claim,"" said ATO assistant commissioner Karen Foat. But, of course, if you're still confused, make sure you check with your accountant.     This article contains general information only. It should not be relied on as financial advice.

54,/news/2020-04-10/south-australia-concern-people-travel-despite-coronavirus-rules/12140466,Holidaymakers continuing to travel despite coronavirus advice ahead of Easter,"Residents on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula have expressed dismay at the number of holidaymakers continuing to arrive in coastal towns, despite advice not to travel this Easter.   Authorities including the Premier and the Police Commissioner have repeatedly urged people to cancel their long weekend travel plans and not to take unnecessary journeys, to protect the community from the spread of coronavirus. ""This Easter, this school holidays, travel around this state is completely and utterly off. We do not want people heading out,"" Premier Steven Marshall said on Sunday. However, Goolwa resident Polly Green told ABC News Breakfast locals in popular south coast tourist towns including Port Elliott and Victor Harbor, and on the other side of the peninsula in Normanville, have noticed a rise in travellers.   She said while it was so far less busy than the typical Easter, a stream of tourists had begun arriving in recent weeks, and the local population was still continuing to swell. ""We've got quite a few hundred here at the moment, which is less than thousands and thousands, but we're very concerned,"" Ms Green said. ""Going down the beaches, families, a lot of young kids, surfing — the locals have been talking [about this] on social media."" Ms Green said she saw caravans heading into town yesterday, despite the fact local accommodation was closed.   She said while some of them were ratepayers who owned holiday houses in the area, she urged anyone who did not need to be in the area to stay away. ""The shops are just packed and no-one's taking the social-distancing rules into consideration, and it's not fair to us,"" she said. ""It's a bit concerning because we've got such an elderly population here, it's one of the high risk areas. ""We want you to come but just not at the moment.""   Coronavirus has so far claimed three lives in South Australia and there have been 421 confirmed cases. ""At the locations people tend to holiday we'll be out in force. We'll have police horses, we'll be using the police helicopter, the police plane, and also drones to monitor areas where we believe crowds are likely to gather,"" Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. ""We've also been in touch with most holiday camps and caravan parks. ""People are not welcome in those areas and some shops are refusing to serve people who do not reside in those areas."" Extra police will monitor border control points, ""limiting the opportunity for people to visit those well-known holiday areas"".   Police yesterday confirmed eleven people had been fined after a house party in Port Augusta on Tuesday night, after the group repeatedly ignored directives from officers. ""The crowd were forcibly dispersed,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""We are prepared to show some tolerance … but where this is a blatant disregard for those warnings, we will take action.""     The Commissioner also warned people who spit or deliberately cough to scare others on public transport could be committing an offence. It follows anecdotal reports of people intentionally coughing near drivers or other passengers to cause distress. ""Any action like that, that is done to cause fear of infection may well constitute a criminal offence,"" Commissioner Stevens said. ""If those matters are reported and we're able to identify those people we will take action. This is an abhorrent act.""      ",,"April 10, 2020"

Officers pulled over a ute towing a trailer during peak hour on Wednesday on the Pacific Highway at Tugun, on the Gold Coast. They said they found 93 kilograms of cannabis, stuffed in plastic bags, and more than $4,000 cash, bound for Queensland. The drugs have an estimated street value of $450,000. The 31-year-old driver, from the Gold Coast suburb of Palm Beach, is facing numerous charges and was also fined $13,000 for breaching the Chief Health Officer's direction regarding border crossings.   He is on bail and is due to face the Coolangatta Magistrates Court in early July. Of the 70,993 vehicles intercepted at Queensland state borders as of midnight, more than 1,000 have been denied entry to the state. Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast Criminal Investigation Branch said any person attempting to enter the state, even if they were a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny.

In Australia, two more deaths have been confirmed, a new $5,000 fine for spitting on health workers has come into effect in New South Wales, and people have been warned to stay at home over Easter. This story is being updated regularly. You can also stay informed with the latest episode of the Coronacast podcast. One in 10 US workers lose their job in just three weeks   Yesterday, Australia recorded its lowest rise in infections in almost a month, with just 96 new cases. But leaders across the country are warning that progress could be reversed if people don't stay at home over Easter. Police are out in force, slapping fines on anyone found to be breaching the rules on physical distancing and non-essential travel. In Tasmania, the Premier warned there would be ""eyes in the sky"". That includes NSW Arts Minister Don Harwin, who has now been fined $1,000 for going to his beach house. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's rate of new infections was only dropping because people had been observing physical-distancing rules. ""It's important because we cannot undo the tremendous progress we have made together in recent times. So this Easter we are staying at home. Don't travel. Don't go away,"" he said. Two more deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed today, one in Victoria and one in New South Wales, taking the national toll to 53. A man who allegedly spat at a Brisbane nurse has been charged with serious assault of a public officer. Police said the incident happened at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's fever clinic on Wednesday. In New South Wales, police will be able to issue $5,000 on-the-spot fines from today for spitting or coughing on emergency service workers or employees going about their duties in a hospital or pharmacy. ""If you had said some time ago, when this crisis started, that people would go out and cough and spit on emergency service workers and people working in pharmacies and hospitals, I would have thought that was remote,"" NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said. ""But we already have seen this sort of activity."" The change under the Public Health Regulation 2012 was signed yesterday after an ""urgent"" request from NSW Health and representatives from unions for healthcare services and police.   The number of deaths in the state of New York has risen by 799, a record high for a third straight day. Meanwhile, New York City increased burial operations on Hart Island, an island where unknown and homeless people are buried, as it deals with dwindling morgue space. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said social distancing was working, and the latest death count reflected the loss of people who became sick earlier in the outbreak. The number of patients newly admitted to hospital in the state dropped for a second day, to 200. Mr Cuomo said that was ""the lowest number we've had since this nightmare started"". New York has now recorded more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19, or nearly half of the total across the country. A University of Washington model often cited by US and state officials projects that COVID-19 will claim 60,415 American lives by August 4, with the peak coming on Easter Sunday. More than 450,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far.   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is now out of intensive care, where he was being treated for COVID-19. The spokesman said Mr Johnson was ""in good spirits"", but he remained in hospital and would continue to be closely monitored. The news came as Britain recorded a slightly lower daily death toll from the virus, with 881 people losing their lives. The day prior, the figure was 938. However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for Mr Johnson, said the UK had not reached the peak of its coronavirus crisis and it was too early too lift its lockdown. UK officials have suggested restrictions could be tightened if people flock to parks and outdoor spaces over what is forecast to be a warm, sunny Easter weekend. Mr Raab led a nationwide show of appreciation for health service workers, with people across Britain giving a round of applause — many from their front doors and windows — for the National Health Service as part of the #ClapForCarers campaign. According to a Johns Hopkins University database, the UK has recorded 65,863 cases of coronavirus and 7,992 deaths.   The Federal Government says it won't be relaxing coronavirus social restrictions so the nation's sporting codes can start playing again unless medical advice says it is safe to do so. The NRL yesterday said it wanted to restart its competition at the end of May, but Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told Sky News he expected the NRL would have to change its plans again if social restrictions remain in force. ""I'm sure that the NRL would not want to breach plans, I think that they would not want to breach legal requirements,"" he said. ""I suspect that they are making assumptions on where Australia would be at that point in time, and that's fair enough for them. I mean, of course, they've got to plan."" The NRL, along with other major sporting codes such as the AFL, suspended its season as tough rules to stop the spread of coronavirus came into force.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned the country will not return to normal until a vaccine is developed, saying that could be ""a very long way off"". The warning came after Canada lost a record 1 million jobs in March and unemployment soared to 7.8 per cent — with Canadian Government data suggesting the real jobless rate was closer to 25 per cent. Local governments across Canada have ordered non-essential businesses shut to combat the spread. Health officials in the country say the death toll is set to soar from more than 500 currently, with the two most likely scenarios showing between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths by the end of the pandemic. ""While some of the numbers released today may seem stark, Canada's modelling demonstrates that the country still has an opportunity to control the epidemic,"" Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said. Canadian officials say if all goes well, the first wave of the outbreak could end by July or August, but that there would be subsequent smaller waves.   Tired of waiting for a rescue from Canberra, a group of Australian travellers and aviation specialists have come together to organise charter flights for a rescue mission out of India. India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb its rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases. About 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, decided to help. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" he said. The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar.   The United States has reached a grim milestone: roughly one in 10 workers has lost their job in the past three weeks. Another 6.6 million people sought unemployment benefits last week, taking the total number of applicants to 16.8 million since the pandemic hit. It's the largest and fastest string of job losses in records dating back to 1948, and economists in the United States expect job losses could hit 20 million in April. With more than 95 per cent of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, businesses have shut down across the country. Nevertheless, Wall Street closed out its best week in 45 years, with the S&P 500 surging by 12 per cent. The US Federal Reserve has launched its latest effort to support the economy through the crisis, announcing programs to provide up to $US2.3 trillion ($3.63 trillion) in loans to households, local governments and businesses. The death toll in France has risen by 1,341 to 12,210 people, the fourth highest tally in the world after Italy, the United States and Spain. That figure includes people who died in care homes over the last two days. More encouragingly, the number of people in intensive care has fallen — albeit slightly — for the first time since the outbreak began. In Italy and Spain, which together have about 33,000 deaths, new infections, hospitalisations and deaths have been levelling off. But Spain's Prime Minister warned that nationwide confinement would likely last until May. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has surpassed 1.5 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.   The International Monetary Fund says the pandemic sweeping the world will turn global economic growth ""sharply negative"" in 2020, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021. Even though governments have already undertaken fiscal stimulus measures of $US8 trillion ($12.6 trillion), the IMF said it was likely that more would be needed. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" she said. Ms Georgieva said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF would expect a partial recovery in 2021, but she also warned the situation could actually get worse. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook. It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic,"" she said. The IMF will release its detailed World Economic Outlook forecasts on Tuesday.   Australian churches will be live streaming — and, in some cases, televising — their Easter services so the faithful can still experience them despite the bans on physical attendance. A Good Friday service from St John's Cathedral in Brisbane will be broadcast on ABC TV at 4:00pm. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney will live stream an Easter Vigil Mass at 6:30pm on Saturday, while its Easter Sunday Mass at 10:30am will also be broadcast on Channel Seven. As well, synagogues that will be streaming Passover services include the Great Synagogue in Sydney, Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, ACT Jewish Centre in Canberra, and Temple David in Perth. Across the globe, Pope Francis will celebrate Easter Mass in a nearly-empty St Peter's Basilica instead of the huge square outside, while in England, the Archbishop of Canterbury will deliver his Easter sermon by video.   UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned the Security Council that the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a rise in ""social unrest and violence"". He said the United Nations faced its ""gravest test"" since the organisation was founded 75 years ago. ""This is the fight of a generation — and the raison d'etre of the United Nations itself,"" he said. The Security Council, which had been silent so far on COVID-19, issued its first brief press statement after a closed meeting. It expressed ""support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected"".   Australia's ambassador to Indonesia is being evacuated based on medical advice, as the spread of coronavirus in the country continues to surge. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has assessed that the risk of coronavirus in Indonesia is now too high for diplomats regarded as most vulnerable. It's understood Ambassador Gary Quinlan is regarded as a high risk for acute illness if he were to catch the virus. He's being relocated back home temporarily but will continue as ambassador from Canberra.   Australia's consul in Bali has already returned for similar reasons. The ABC has also learnt that an Australian man has died in Jakarta with symptoms of COVID-19, although he was not tested for the disease. At least one other Australian is known to have been severely ill. There have been 280 confirmed deaths in Indonesia, with 3,293 cases. But a low rate of testing means the true number of deaths and cases is likely to be far higher. The number of cases in Indonesia is expected to peak around May.   Iran's Supreme Leader has called on Iranians to create the sense of Ramadan in their homes, since public gatherings are banned as the country tries to contain one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Schools and universities remain closed in the Islamic Republic and a ban on cultural, religious and sports gatherings has been imposed. Ramadan begins at sundown on April 23 and lasts for 30 days. ""Because of being deprived of public prayings, speeches and so on during Ramadan, we should create the same senses in our homes,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech. His remarks came as Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur announced that Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen by 117 to 4,110. There are now 66,220 coronavirus cases, he said, noting that 32,309 people have recovered.            ",,"April 10, 2020"
57,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"
58,/news/2020-04-10/visa-holders-in-tasmania-fear-being-forced-home-amid-coronavirus/12140780,Foreign visa holders struggling after missing out on coronavirus JobKeeper package,"The list of things Rosan Bhattarai loves about his adopted home is long.   The Nepali national loves Australia's education system, career opportunities and lifestyle, but chief among his reasons for living and working in the ""lucky country"" for the past seven years is that everyone is treated equally. ""My boss or my manager, I still can put my opinions to them, and that's what really drove me to come to Australia,"" Mr Bhattarai said. From the end of this month, Mr Bhattarai will be without any source of income because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on his tourist-dependent job. Mr Bhattarai is on a foreign visa, meaning he is ineligible for a share in the $130 billion in wage support that passed both houses of the Federal Parliament this week.   The Hobart resident applied for permanent residency two years ago but he is yet to learn whether he has been successful. ""There are people like me who want to contribute to the economy, who are looking forward to the development of themselves and the community as they have been here for so many years,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""We want to help Australia, we want to help create a good version of Australia … and I would request that the Government not put everyone in the same basket."" The Tasmanian Government has worked hard to attract overseas residents to help boost the ageing population and fill gaps in the workforce. The entire state is classed regional, which can help a person's case in applying to become a permanent resident. The Greens tried to amend the Federal Government's JobKeeper package in Parliament on Wednesday to include income support for temporary migrants. Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim said: ""Tasmania has a significant number of foreign workers, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. ""Some business owners are doing their best to look after temporary visa holders with no income, but that should be the Government's job."" People on temporary visas are also ineligible for the JobSeeker payment.   Tasmanian state MP Madeleine Ogilvie described the situation as a ""crisis"", with staff in her office in Hobart's northern suburbs working around the clock to provide support to people like Mr Bhattarai. ""The reality is that we've invited these people here to come study with us, come work with us, come help us and be part of the community, and now things have gotten to a very, very bad stage,"" Ms Ogilvie said. ""At the moment, I don't believe that we as a country and as a state are living up to what we've offered them."" Unions Tasmania has been similarly flooded with calls from people on temporary visas unsure how they will survive without a stable income. ""They pay tax while they're here, they make a contribution, and whilst many of them are not going to be here forever, lots are building their lives here, they're building their home,"" secretary Jessica Munday said. ""We're literally talking about forcing people into destitution and homelessness at a time when we're asking them to stay at home, isolate and stay safe.""   Tasmanian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Simone Zell said member organisations were supporting overseas workers with food and welfare checks. ""The Government is in a position to offer assistance to our migrant visa holders,"" Ms Zell said. ""These people are contributing to our communities and our local economies."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier this week the Government tried to create the broadest and fairest possible JobKeeker scheme but had to ""draw the line somewhere"". The Federal Government will allow migrant workers to access up to $10,000 from their superannuation funds.   Diem Doan has been in Tasmania for about six months, describing it as ""one of the most beautiful states in Australia"". ""It's peaceful, the people here are friendly and lovely and nice, and that drew me,"" Ms Doan said from her Hobart home. ""Also, I want to get permanent residency for the long-term, and Tasmania offers state sponsorship."" After being stood down from her restaurant job, Ms Doan is unsure how she will continue to live in Australia — her home for the past six years.   Her family in Vietnam will provide some financial support, and she will continue to hunt for a new job, she said. ""I still have to go get groceries, I still have to pay for all the bills every month,"" Ms Doan said. ""Luckily my landlord reduced my rent for us, so that's a little support but it really means a lot to us."" Mr Bhattarai said Population Minister Alan Tudge's comment that people who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home was ""heartbreaking"". He and Ms Doan said they were not sure how they would even return to Asia given widespread lockdowns and a lack of flights. ""Australia is one of the countries that has taught me more than my home because I basically did my first job here, I studied my bachelor's here, I have my sisters and in-laws here,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""I don't want to leave Australia because I still want to progress my career, and it's home."" Premier Peter Gutwein said the Tasmanian Government would provide support where it could.

59,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-enforcement-warning-for-easter-weekend/12138518,Easter is 'the most important weekend' in Australia's coronavirus fight as police warn of fines,"On a crucial weekend for Australia's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, leaders have warned there will be no tolerance for breaches of strict self-isolation measures.   Australia's containment controls — including the mandatory quarantine of international visitors, closed state borders and fines for people being outside without a valid reason — have helped ""flatten the curve"" and resulted in fewer than 100 new cases in 24 hours for the first time in three weeks. But Health Minister Greg Hunt warned the Easter weekend was not a time to ease the restrictions. ""As we go into Easter with welcome news for Australia, the virus does not take a holiday, therefore none of us can relax what we do,"" he said. ""This, in many ways, is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus.  ""If we can lock in the gains that we've made as a nation through the courage and sacrifice of those on the health, medical and policing frontlines, but also through the immense goodwill and discipline of Australians, then we can help really protect Australian lives going forward and give ourselves the pathway through."" The restrictions will apply to visits to the beach, attending church services, going interstate or holding large family gatherings.     Each state and territory has announced its own penalties and fines for breaching the restrictions on gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances. State governments have issued strong warnings that police will have helicopters in the air, patrols of holiday destinations and will be using numberplate technology this weekend to find people who are gathering in large groups or who are a long way from their homes.   It comes after several flagrant breaches of the restrictions — including 58 COVID-19 fines for a car rally south of Brisbane, a party at a Sunshine Coast hotel and a man escaping enforced self-isolation in a hotel in Perth and travelling around the city.   Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein warned ""the gloves [had] come off"", announcing a statewide blitz this weekend, including the use of helicopters and police visits to holiday shacks, after reports people were taking campers and trailers to the coast. ""We still have Tasmanians that are flouting the rules,"" he said. ""I have been fair, I have been reasonable and I have taken every step and every precaution that we can to save lives. But we will only save lives if Tasmanians follow the rules.   ""Today we'll be putting helicopters up. There will be eyes in the sky.""   Officers in Victoria will also be checking holiday destinations to enforce compliance, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said. ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you.""   Queensland has introduced a permit for residents returning to the state, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warning ""now is not the time to go into New South Wales"" and refusing to rule out stricter border controls. Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said there were still too many people trying to use beaches, which were closed to ""out-of-towners"". ""Last weekend, we had so many people descend onto the Gold Coast that those social-distancing measures were so extraordinarily difficult to enforce, people were still sunbaking, congregating, and this is what we want to avoid,"" she said. ""What we're saying is please can you just stay home for these next few weeks. You can still get out and do your exercise, but do it locally. New South Wales Arts Minister Don Harwin was forced to apologise and return to Sydney after being sprung at his Central Coast holiday house, despite bans on non-essential travel. The state has also announced $5,000 fines for people who deliberately spit or cough on frontline workers in response to reports of abuse and assault towards people in uniform. Police around Australia have already issued hundreds of fines for breaching the self-isolation legislation.    ",By Liam Butterworth,"April 10, 2020"
60,/news/2020-03-17/coronavirus-cases-data-reveals-how-covid-19-spreads-in-australia/12060704,ABC coronavirus data charts COVID-19 spread in Australia,"The charts below provide a guide to how Australia is faring in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. They use figures from a national dataset of every confirmed case since January 25, when the country's first four cases were reported.  The data, compiled by ABC News, tracks confirmed cases by gender, age, location, source of infection and other information published in case reports from state and federal health authorities. It is supplemented with additional reporting by ABC News and updated daily to show the spread of the disease across Australia's states and territories. The latest update was at ___  (Tap/hover on any chart for more information.) To date, state and territory health authorities have reported  ___ confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia, including __ deaths. Roughly ___ , or ___ new cases, were reported in the past 48 hours.  (Note that national daily and cumulative counts are likely to be lower earlier in the day, as some states/territories will not have reported their figures yet.) But the number of confirmed cases is only part of the story. An important measure of the spread of infectious disease is the growth rate. One way of tracking growth is by looking at the daily percentage change in total confirmed cases. This shows Australia's growth rate has fallen from a peak of more than 25 per cent in mid-March to less than 5 per cent in early April, based on the five-day moving average. The aim is to reach zero — and stay there. Another way of measuring the spread of disease is by how long it takes the number of confirmed cases to double — also known as the ""doubling time"". This is easier to see when the number of confirmed cases is plotted on a log scale.  On the chart above, each tick on the vertical axis is 10 times the value of the previous tick. The slope of the line shows how long it takes the number of cases to rise from 10 to 100 to 1000, and so on. The steeper the line, the faster the growth rate. It shows that for most of March, Australia's count of confirmed cases doubled every 3-4 days. However, there are signs it is slowing — although experts warn the trend may not be sustained. Here is the same chart but for each of the states and territories. It shows the largest states are on roughly the same growth trajectory. A similar kind of chart can be used to compare Australia's growth rate to other countries.  This one uses the same log scale but rather than exact dates, it tracks each country's cumulative case count from the day that country reached 100 cases. This brings each country onto the same timeline. It shows that in many countries, including Australia, the number of confirmed infections grew rapidly early in the outbreak, doubling every 3 days or less.  In other countries, such as Japan and Singapore, initial growth rates were slower, with cases taking a week or more to double . The chart also shows that countries such as South Korea and China started with very steep growth rates but now have much flatter lines, which means they have successfully slowed their growth rates. (For more on how other countries are winning the fight against COVID-19, read this analysis.) Figures for Australia show ___ has the most confirmed cases, making up ___ of the total number of infections, followed by ___ and ___. However, the picture shifts when population size is taken into account.  Adjusting the figures for the number of residents shows ___ still has the highest number of infections per 100,000 residents, but it is followed by ___, then ___. ___ has the lowest infections per 100,000, followed by ___. Nationally, ___ people have died — __. At least 17 deaths across the country were of cruise ships passengers. Figures show __ people have recovered from the disease, leaving ___ confirmed cases still current or ""active"". The vast majority of current cases do not require hospitalisation.  The chart below shows the number of people in hospital (including in ICU and ventilated) as a percentage of current cases in each state and territory. Nationally, __ people (or __ per cent of current cases) are receiving hospital care, including __ (or __ per cent of current cases) in ICU.  Of those in ICU, __ (__ per cent of current cases) are ventilated. (Figures for the number of ventilated patients in WA are pending.) These hospitalisation figures are based on a snapshot of a point in time, rather than a cumulative count of patients hospitalised since the virus was first detected in Australia. It is important to note that case numbers and diagnosis rates are heavily influenced by the rate of testing.  At roughly 1,250 tests per 100,000 residents, Australia's rate of testing per capita is among the highest in the world, according to figures from Our World in Data. However, federal government figures show the number of tests added each day — think of this as similar to the daily ""growth rate"" of tests — has fallen in recent weeks. It is unclear how much this has influenced the apparent slowdown in new diagnoses. The bars in this chart show the cumulative number of samples tested each day in Australia. The lines show the percentage change (or ""growth rate"") in the cumulative number of tests. Nationally, the number of tests added each day has fallen from a peak of 8 per cent on March 26 to less than 4 per cent since April 7, based on the 5-day moving average. Notably, this decline has coincided with the expansion of coronavirus testing criteria.  Some experts have linked the fall to lower numbers of returned travellers. Others have attributed it to fewer people presenting with symptoms. A breakdown of total tests by jurisdiction shows ___ has tested the most samples of any state or territory, followed by ___ then ___. However, adjusting for population shows ___ has the highest rate of testing, at roughly ___ the rate in ___, which has the nation's lowest rate of testing. ___ and ___ have the second- and third-highest rates of testing, respectively. Data on the percentage of tests that come back positive for COVID-19 show __, then __ and ___, have the highest positive test rates, while ___ and ___ have the lowest.  Again, this is influenced by testing rates, since the broader the testing regime, the lower the odds of finding positive cases.  Another way of looking at rates of testing is to compare the number of residents to the number of tests, both as a share of the national total. ___ accounts for ___ of Australia’s population but ___ of samples tested in Australia, while __ accounts for ___ of the population but ___ of tests. By contrast, ___ makes up ___ of the population but only ___ of tests. Similarly, ___ accounts for just over ___ of Australia's population, but only ___ of tests. People ___ have the most confirmed cases of any age group. However, adjusting these numbers for the size of each age group shows people __ have the highest rate of confirmed cases.  They are followed by people __ and people  __, and then those ___. When a case is confirmed, health authorities undertake detailed tracing to identify the source of transmission. Nationally, ___ of cases were acquired overseas, while ___ were acquired locally. This includes ___ transmitted locally with no known link to a confirmed case or cluster. A breakdown of the data by gender suggests little difference in the rate of diagnosis between men and women.     Dates refer to the date the case was reported by authorities, except in these instances: - The 5th, 6th and 7th confirmed cases in Victoria have been assigned to the date they were first cited in official press releases. These cases were first announced on March 1, as having recovered from the virus. - Dates for the 7th and 8th confirmed cases in Queensland (Diamond Princess cruise ship evacuees) are based on ABC News reports. The 9th confirmed Queensland case, another Diamond Princess evacuee, was first announced in a press release on March 3.

61,/news/2020-04-10/imf-tips-coronavirus-causing-worst-downturn-since-depression/12140392,"Coronavirus to cause worst economic downturn since Great Depression, IMF forecasts","The coronavirus pandemic will push the global economy into the deepest recession since the Great Depression, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says.   IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the world's poorest countries would suffer the most if the COVID-19 fallout drove markets to their lowest levels since the 1930s. ""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" Ms Georgieva said, speaking ahead of next week's virtual meetings of the 189-nation IMF and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank. She said the IMF would release an updated world economic forecast on Tuesday that would show just how quickly the coronavirus outbreak had turned what had been expected to be a solid year of growth into a deep downturn.    Just three months ago, the IMF was forecasting 160 nations would enjoy positive income growth on a per capita basis.  Now the expectation is more than 170 nations will have negative per capita income growth this year.    Emerging markets and low-income nations across Africa, Latin America and much of Asia were at high risk, she said.   ""With weak health systems to begin with, many face the dreadful challenge of fighting the virus in densely populated cities and poverty-stricken slums, where social distancing is hardly an option,"" Ms Georgieva said. Investors have grown fearful of leaving their money in emerging economies that could be hit hard by a global recession.  As a result, capital outflows from emerging-market countries has totalled more than $US100 billion ($158 billion) over the past two months, more than three times larger than the same period at the start of the global financial crisis, Ms Georgieva noted. In addition, countries that depend on exporting commodities have taken a double blow because of the steep fall in commodity prices.   Numbers released on Thursday by the US Government showed 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.  That amounts to about one in 10 American workers — the biggest, fastest pile-up of job losses since the world's largest economy began keeping records in 1948. And still more job cuts are expected.  The US unemployment rate in April could hit 15 per cent, a number not seen since the tail end of the Great Depression. Ms Georgieva said there was no question 2020 would be an ""exceptionally difficult"" year. She said if the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, allowing the gradual lifting of containment measures and the reopening of the global economy, the IMF was forecasting a partial recovery in 2021. ""I stress there is tremendous uncertainty around the outlook,"" she said.  ""It could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.""   She said she and World Bank president David Malpass would pursue at next week's virtual meetings an agreement to adopt a standstill on debt payments over the next year by the world's poorest nations, freeing up money they could use for critical health needs. She also said the IMF was prepared to commit its $US1 trillion in lending capacity to providing support to nations that needed help dealing with the pandemic. ""We are responding to an unprecedented number of calls for emergency financing from over 90 countries so far,"" she said. The IMF's executive board agreed to double the loan levels it would provide from its emergency facilities that she said should allow the IMF to provide about $US100 billion in financing to low-income countries.

62,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-second-wave/12138482,"What causes a 'second wave' outbreak of coronavirus, and could we see this in Australia?","Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing. However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection. As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.     Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one. If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away. When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity. If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.   Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection. Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last. The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely. As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.   A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission. If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave. When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.   Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate. Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection. In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound. We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave. However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19. Australia's current efforts are focused on ""flattening the curve"" of the first wave of COVID-19. Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising. But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave. And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward. We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

63,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-lessons-we-can-learn-from-history/12134044,Coronavirus lessons we can learn from other dark times in history,"""One thing I've learned in life is, money can be a very lonely companion. Kindness matters most."" Those are words of advice from 96-year-old Joy Wheatley, who has witnessed multiple crises, including World War II and the Great Depression — events that were devastating, but united many people against a single challenge. She said, alongside the poverty and desperation, were acts of generosity as the entire population came together. ""I went to school with boys who didn't have shoes,"" she said. ""But we were all in it together, and there was no stigma to being poor."" Then came World War II. ""Drastic measures came in about rationing and other things overnight,"" she said. ""Suddenly [people in authority] had the ability to send people to work where they'd decided they were most useful. ""I think that was the swiftest reaction to the change of our way of life."" For Joy, the coronavirus pandemic does not feel new, only different. And she can sum up her advice to others facing a global crisis in three words: ""Resilience, hope, kindness."" It is a joyful perspective that historians say is reflective of the way governments have long responded to the most significant crises. They say history tells us positivity is key to our ability to successfully overcome the social and economic challenges coronavirus brings.   ""The most terrible thing was the despair into which people fell."" According to Professor Frank Bongiorno from the Australian National University School of History, Thucydides's description of the plague that struck Athens in 460BC bears a strong resemblance to the current pandemic — not because COVID-19 is as deadly, but in the way people worked to help each other. Since the beginning of coronavirus's impact on Australia, the country's leaders have made the effort to inject positive messaging into their press conferences and updates. Amid the uncertainty, there have been constant reminders of how, if we work together, we can overcome this, flatten the curve.   That positivity is a vital component of leaders' responses, according to Professor Bongiorno. He said the optimism shown by Joy Wheatley was reminiscent of the kind of morale-boosting advertising she would have been exposed to during WWII. ""Governments knew that the morale of society more generally could win or lose a war,"" he said. ""One of the reasons Germany lost the war was that it couldn't feed itself, and that collapse of home front morale was critical because it affected the troops as well — they knew that their families were back in Berlin starving."" Professor Buongiorno said the recent panic-buying and abuse aimed at healthcare workers in hospitals and pharmacies was not simply poor behaviour, but a sign that some were struggling to trust the overarching system of governance. ""There was rationing in World War II and when word got out that clothing was about to be rationed, people just went into the department stores and went berserk,"" he said. ""It's really important that governments provide a sense they know what's going on and that they do know how to manage a critical shortage of something like medical supplies, so that people's generosity is cultivated.""   Whether it is clapping for healthcare workers or Spotify promoting Ben Lee's We're All in This Together, Professor Buongiorno said rally cries mattered. ""There's been effectively a kind of science on this — government advertising campaigns are a part of that,"" he said. ""They're not just about telling people they need to wash their hands, they're about telling people things are under control, and we'll get through it. ""It is effectively propaganda and we need propaganda in situations like this, we just usually call it government advertising.""  But he said strict penalties imposed by NSW Police in recent weeks had been ""hugely damaging"" to this effort. ""The imposition of fines for people sitting on park benches has been incredibly damaging, because it's undermined a sense of government authority, of being able to prioritise and follow the science,"" he said. ""You don't want these stories circulating. You want to know that the rules they're enforcing make sense or you'll get all sorts of problems, like evasion of the rules.""   Where Joy Wheatley witnessed a high employment rate in the 1940s, in 2020, we are seeing the opposite. Today, the country's service industry is much larger than at any other time in history, which has led to huge job losses and a radical transformation of Australian life. Even 20 years ago, Australia's cafe culture and restaurant industry was not nearly as booming as it was two months ago, Professor Bongiorno said. ""In some ways I can see why our economy is so vulnerable now, because of that,"" he said.   With cafes and restaurants closed, the home has now become the primary source of both entertainment and productivity.  Whereas during the Great Depression people would have turned to extended family if they were evicted or lost work, families are now forced to stay connected via technology. But the result of this physical disconnection has seen the emergence of smaller acts of kindness that are reminiscent of the war effort — like when people were encouraged to drink less beer to support sailors. Organising free coffees for healthcare workers echoes the campaign to ""make do and mend"" instead of buying new clothes, Professor Bongiorno said. Economically, we are worlds apart, but essentially, little has changed. ""We're having to be weaned off the lifestyle to which we've become accustomed,"" Professor Bongiorno said. And those smaller acts of solidarity will see people through, Mrs Wheatley said. ""I don't like texts and emails very much because they're so impersonal — when you ring someone up and have a chat with them, it's amazing how it lifts their spirits,"" she said.   When the plague struck Athens in 430BC, many chose not to isolate but headed out to care for the sick and fell ill themselves. They felt there was honour in this caring role, and therefore honour in contracting plague. Professor Bongiorno said the description of this event shared some characteristics with the current pandemic, including in how healthcare has taken on a new significance. And with the changes to Centrelink payments, he said an ideological shift had likely taken place in how Australians viewed welfare.   World War I forced a radical transformation of the workforce as able-bodied men headed overseas to join conflict. Those who were left, many of them women, had no choice but to step up and take on roles formerly considered beyond their capabilities.   ""Far from people staying at home, they were being drawn out,"" he said. ""You didn't have the sense of economic insecurity that people are experiencing now — people had lots and lots of money but nothing to spend it on."" Society began to view women differently, just as certain shifts are happening now. But the real question is: After COVID-19, which changes will last? Greater support for jobseekers, hospitality workers and artists, and higher wages for those on the frontlines of healthcare, could become long-lasting changes, in the way conflict once transformed society's views about women in the workforce. ""What people are asking now is, what comes after COVID-19?"" Professor Bongiorno said. ""There's a sense that the pandemic has exposed all sorts of gaps in policy ""A whole series of things that people have been advocating for years but got nowhere, are they going to become possible after this?""

64,/news/2020-04-10/darwin-ranger-jailed-for-drug-importation/12137930,Darwin council ranger sentenced in NT Supreme Court for supply of dangerous drugs,"A former Darwin council ranger, who used her job to scope out vacant properties for drug deliveries, has been sentenced in the Northern Territory Supreme Court for the ""careful and methodical"" supply of dangerous drugs.    Kirsten Rose Strickland, 41, worked for the City of Darwin when she organised for more than 100 parcels of drugs ordered on the dark web to be delivered to empty Darwin properties and Australia Post offices. ""The addresses were not randomly chosen by you, rather, you operated in a careful and methodical fashion,"" Justice Peter Barr said in sentencing. ""You identified unoccupied dwellings which were advertised for rent or for sale, to which you could have drugs delivered.  ""You also acquainted yourself with Australia Post mail routes and the timing of postal deliveries."" Between June 2018 and January 2019, Strickland ordered 154 packages of drugs from 41 international vendors and had them delivered to 30 different Darwin properties, addressed to 74 different identities.    The Northern Territory Supreme Court heard police located detailed maps of Darwin city, postal timetables and drug paraphernalia during a search of Strickland's Darwin CBD apartment.  In November 2018, after investigations by a joint taskforce of NT Police, Australian Border Force, Australian Federal Police and others, officers followed Strickland as she collected parcels from empty letterboxes around Darwin while driving a council vehicle and wearing her ranger uniform.  An empty package, containing traces of MDMA, was recovered in a bin outside the Darwin Council offices.  ""At the time of your arrest on 16 November 2018, Australian Border Force and NT Police had identified and intercepted 32 consignments of drugs ordered by you addressed to non-existent recipients,"" Justice Barr said. A further seven packages were delivered after Strickland had been taken into custody.  The court heard Strickland had never used drugs until she ""became deeply depressed"" and began using ecstasy in January 2018 at the age of 40.  A mental health report indicated a link between Strickland's mental health issues and drug use, however, Justice Barr rejected any argument that it led to her supply of commercial quantities of drugs.    ""Your depressive illness does not explain your venture into drug importation and commercial supply in what was a well-organised and methodical operation, both logistically and in terms of meticulous record keeping,"" Justice Barr said.  The court heard there was a ""significant element of fraud and dishonesty"" as well as Strickland's drug supply crimes. Strickland profited about $100,000 from the sale of dangerous drugs over six months. ""You somehow convinced yourself at the time of offending that you were not a drug dealer and you were just ensuring high-quality drugs for yourself and your friends,"" said Justice Barr.  ""However, rationalisations and excuses for criminal conduct are common."" Strickland pleaded guilty to three counts of supplying dangerous drugs, including cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and almost 50 times the commercial threshold of MDMA.  She was sentenced to six years in jail, with a four year and three-month non-parole period. The 41-year-old is no longer an employee of the City of Darwin.",By Melissa Mackay,"April 10, 2020"

66,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-empty-nest-full-again/12123600,Coronavirus self-isolation with my adult children is like a blast from the past,"A lot of us are in lockdown with kids in the house. But what do you do when those kids are university students who haven't lived at home for months? In a city where rents are expensive, and the interstate university colleges where they used to live are closed, my family finds itself in self-isolation with two university students who are studying online. Suddenly, we are a family of four again. I was delighted to have our beautiful young adults back with us. We were hoping to take advantage of reassimilating and getting to know each other again, doing the quality-time thing.  But it's a different landscape to raising school-age children. For one, the hours are different.   As I write this it's about 2.30 in the afternoon.  I've been up with my husband since before 7am and Uni Student One, who is 20, has just got out of bed.  The younger one is still asleep. We don't expect him to grace us with his presence before 5pm.   Living with uni students is like living with perpetual jetlag except that it is not your own. We aren't operating on the same time zones. Now let me qualify this: they haven't been out disobeying the Government's directions to not socialise in groups of more than two. They haven't had any mates to the house — we are self-isolating after all. They haven't even left the house in over a week.  So far, so legally good. Yet neither of them were in bed until after 5am so they are catching up on their eight hours. Like the possums and bats that frequent the nightscape around where we live, I've discovered my sons are nocturnal: their natural hours of wakefulness barely coincide with mine.  I'm used to a little coming and going during the night (okay sometimes more than a little) but it's an adjustment having them back, and for them too after the freedoms of living away.   It's not just the time zones that are different. The culture shock is real too. While in lockdown, one son has decided to take up a hobby: he's learning guitar.  And while it might be lovely to be strummed to sleep it's far less enjoyable being awoken in the middle of the night to the sound of someone attempting to learn a Jimmy Hendrix riff. (And I stress that's not ""playing"", just ""learning"", which means repeating the same series of chords over and over and over again, and singing the same lyrics on repeat).   Uni Student 2, traditionally the more sporty of the two, has set up a home gym out the back of the house and in the garage using whatever he can cobble together. This means some old weights, some kitchen items, the broom, a back pack with what I think must be dirt inside. Frankly, I don't want to know. I was so looking forward to life with my children again. But instead, life with the uni students means every four bars of Hendrix's Foxy Lady is punctuated with the great thud of a dropped weight on the concrete or a loud grunt of exertion. My sons' body clocks make it impossible for us to time meals together (so much for that quality time).  Hubby and I eat regularly at 7.30pm and the meal we choose at that time is called dinner. Not breakfast.   Dinner for the nocturnal members of the household occurs around 3am and involves microwaving the prepared family meal that they couldn't eat at their ""breakfast"" time. If they are still hungry, I can look forward to a cacophony of banging. It's not weights or music this time, but pots and pans, kitchen drawers, microwave oven doors and fridge doors, over and over again. It finishes not long before my day to begins again, at 6am, with the aftermath from this 3am banquet they didn't quite manage to clean up. So what to do with people who are vibrantly alive in the middle of the night while us parents are trying to sleep in order to be ready to work from home in the morning?  There's plenty of advice for home schooling or entertaining 10-year-olds with online trips to the zoo or recycled craft projects. But what do you do with young people who are a little too old to be sent to bed or the naughty corner? In this household, it's a dilemma that has added a strange new layer to self-isolation. And even though they're young adults it reminds of a time when we used to be awoken to the cries of hunger or the dirty nappy and the argument about who had to get up earlier for work tomorrow and who could do without sleep and get up and change the baby! We'll be thankful they toilet themselves now and feed themselves at whatever time. Because for the first time in a while we're all back together, in the one nest, with time to laugh about who was the loudest baby, who was the most terrible two year old and who made Mum angry. Best of all we get to enjoy those Dad jokes all over again! Who would have thought that there was a silver lining to coronavirus lockdown but it's nice to have time to be ""us four"" again.  So we continue to be patient, as much as we can, for as long as this time lasts.    ",By Mary-Elizabeth Brien,"April 10, 2020"

What a radical idea … but one that is increasingly true of today's generation of grandmothers.  A sweet memory of my time as president of the Australian Human Rights Commission was being asked by my executive assistant to look down from my Pitt Street office to the Grandmothers for Refugees singing in the street below to support the commission and its advocacy for refugees detained indefinitely in offshore detention camps. What a delight to see the men in their suits walk by in bemused wonderment. How mistaken to dismiss these grandmothers as having passed their use-by date. Why should we be surprised? This generation of grandmothers came from the '60s and '70s, many — and for the first time in history — spending formative years at university with free or minimal fees, marching against Vietnam, experimenting with sexual liberation, burning our bras and ""making love not war"". Political activism is mother's milk to many of the women from those times. Over the following years, this unique generation of women rode the crest of a wave of opportunity and optimism. The Sex Discrimination Act was passed in 1984 — problem of equality fixed. The future was ours. And, to a significant degree, so it has been. Today, women over 60 are often well-educated and financially independent, having had a fruitful career while also doing a decent job of raising their children. Today, the '60s generation of women is emerging as a political force to be reckoned with.   But wait. How can it be that the position of women in Australia has been in regression over the past 15 years or so? Here are some disturbing facts. The fastest-growing group of homeless people in Australia is not 18-year-old youths sleeping under a bridge, but women over 55. How ignominious and sad to have to ask your son or niece if you can sleep on their sofa for a few weeks as you can no longer pay the rent or the mortgage. Women retire today on 46 per cent of the superannuation available to men. Why? Because we agree to accept flexible, casual and contract work with little job security or opportunities for promotion. We fall off the superannuation ladder and never catch up, despite providing most unpaid caring work across the nation. Women are still at the bottom of the employment pyramid in female-dominated industries — as hospital paramedics and cleaners, factory workers, maids and waitresses, in hotels and restaurants and in low-paid teaching and nursing positions. The gender pay gap of around 16 per cent is narrowing with glacial speed. In 2006, the World Economic Forum's Gender Index placed Australia 15th globally, broadly among the nations we would most expect to be compared with — New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and the Scandinavian countries. Ten years later, in 2016, we had slipped to 46th. By 2018, we had gone up a few points to 39th. Our 2020 ranking is 44th. We remain today stubbornly consigned to the lower ranks, below Serbia, Bolivia, Laos, Latvia, Cuba and Burundi.   The WEF Global Index is measured against four indices: economic participation, health and survival, educational attainment and political empowerment. The good news is that, not surprisingly, Australian women and girls are ranked first in the world for educational attainment. But now the bad news: we are a 103rd for health, 77th for ministerial positions in government, 49th for political empowerment and 46th for economic participation. Our hopes for fair access to work were raised by Tony Abbott's promise, as leader of the opposition, of a ""rolled-gold"" six months' maternity leave, only to be dashed when the political debate descended into allegations women were ""double dippers"" and ""welfare cheats"". The law for Australian women remains at 18 weeks' paid maternity leave at minimum wage, compared with Sweden's paternity leave of 480 days at 80 per cent of salary. How has it come to this? Why has education not ensured genuine equality? Why are Australia's women not in the streets demanding fairness from a male-dominated government and corporate sector? Are we, at heart, just like our grandmothers? Has very little really changed? Are grandmothers, by culture or by a law of nature, destined merely to be sweet, passive, caring and kind; to stand behind their men, support the family, love their grandchildren and seek little for themselves?   My grandmother, Sarah-Jane, met all these clichéd standards. She was born in the reign of Queen Victoria, in 1899. She admirably met the traditional image of a grandmother: pretty, even in old age, white-haired and blue-eyed. In 1958, as we stood on the deck of the Iberia, the flagship of the Orient and Pacific Line, leaving from Tilbury Docks for Australia, my mother said, ""Give your grandmother a special wave. She is old and we may not see her again."" Sarah-Jane was 62, dressed in black, wearing pearl earrings and 60-denier lisle stockings, wrinkled at her ankles. Widowed at 53, with few financial resources, she had never been employed. Sarah-Jane was largely dependent on her daughters and sons-in-law.   She came to Melbourne several times to visit us and lived to be 89. Sarah-Jane avoided any sort of disagreement or controversy in private, let alone in the public arena. ""A lady's name should appear in the newspapers only three times in her life: on birth, marriage and death."" She would have been horrified to know that her granddaughter was the subject of 42 satirical cartoons and more than 60,000 words (and counting) of newsprint castigating me for my work as president of the AHRC. For Sarah-Jane, family was all. She believed wholeheartedly in the adage that blood is thicker than water. As one of a typically large Victorian family of eight siblings, she was never particularly interested in widening her small group of friends. I have followed her directions for a successful dinner party. It was bad form, she believed, to engage in one-to-one private conversations; a general conversation among the group on a neutral topic was the desired objective. Sex and religion should never be discussed. In this, I have strayed from her protocol. But I also prefer a wide-ranging debate at dinner. When I was first married to my husband and joined international diplomatic life as a ""trailing spouse"", I remember him accusing me of conducting seminars at official dinner parties! Sarah-Jane might have been surprised to know that she has been a driving motivator in my life. As a teenager in the early '60s, I have a vivid memory of one of her visits. She was sitting up in bed, counting out her small change on the bedspread to see if she could stretch her money to buy a Christmas present for each member of the family. The sum total was pitiful. Sarah-Jane had no means to increase her funds beyond whatever the family's largesse had provided her. Mercifully, my parents were in business as jewellers and were, indeed, generous. At Christmas, we each received a modest gift from Sarah-Jane, and I treasured mine. Yet another seemingly insignificant incident compounded my understanding of my grandmother's loss of autonomy. Like Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Sarah-Jane always wore pearls: three-strand necklaces and earrings. As the earrings were clipped on (pierced ears were vulgar), she was constantly losing one. To go out in public without her pearls was unthinkable. She would ask my father, through the agency of my mother, to buy her new ones. As the saga of the lost earring was oft-repeated, my father became increasingly annoyed, but would eventually relent and provide another. I was struck at the time by the ignominy of Sarah-Jane's position.   Today, if I had lost such an item, I would simply buy a replacement without a second thought. I doubt she was ever able to enjoy that freedom. Such minuscule details of ordinary life mark how things have changed for women today who have financial autonomy. Even as a young girl, I was mortified by the evident frustration of an older woman who had so little financial independence. I vowed never to be in that position. I knew, instinctively, that to reach whatever potential one might have, it was essential, as Virginia Woolf well understood, to have ""a room of one's own"". That is not to say that money has been a catalyst for my work over the decades, but rather that a reliable income is vital to achieving autonomy. Sarah-Jane also had a steely inner core. Arriving home after school one day, I was shocked when she asked me, ""Will you do the ironing or shall I?"" As she'd left the house for work that morning, my mother had apparently airily asked my grandmother to iron the ever-mounting pile of sheets, shirts and napkins, always the last household chore to be tackled. From my mother's point of view, as Sarah-Jane was at home all day, this seemed to be an entirely reasonable request. Not so for Sarah-Jane. The heat of the summer was inescapable and enervating. She was probably about 70 years old. Far better to ask a healthy teenager. I, of course, agreed to do the ironing, but filed away for future reference that my grandmother was smarter than others gave her credit for! As Sarah-Jane sank into the oblivion of Alzheimer's, she lived out her last years in an aged-care residence in London. Whenever I returned to England, I would visit my tranquil, beautifully dressed grandmother, who, having no idea who I was, said to me, ""You're a nice young girl. Do come to see me again."" I would leave in tears, but grateful that Sarah-Jane had at least found some sort of serenity.   Delving into these sepia-tinted flashes from the past, I am surprised by how powerful — even hurtful — they remain. Why would I care today about such fleeting incidents, which one might have imagined would quickly fade? I do not know. But perhaps the psychologists would say that such early experiences shape our adult lives in profound, lasting and unexpected ways. Sarah-Jane would not recognise my 21st-century role as a grandmother. At 74, I am working, travelling and continuing to be outspoken. My grandchildren, Sia (aged four) and Leonard (aged two), live an international life in Paris and are becoming bilingual. I speak to them by Skype and babysit for a couple of weeks in July when the creches and schools are closed for the summer. Every second year, they come to Australia for Christmas. I have some French and would love to speak to my grandchildren in their first language. Rightly, their parents, my son James and his French partner, Marie, insist that I speak only English, otherwise Sia and Leonard will adopt the easy option of French. Sia thinks I am intellectually rather slow. If I mispronounce a word in French or make a grammatical error (quelle horreur), she corrects me and, in exasperation, employs both the English and French words to ensure I get her point. I love being with such bright, energetic children and am sometimes sad that I am a distant, fly-in, fly-out spectre in their lives. My relationship with my grandchildren will be very different from many grandparenting relationships of the past. Different but, I hope, just as special. The geographical distance means that I will not be part of the day-to-day lives of Sia and Leonard. I will not be able to pick them up from school and hear their triumphs and woes. I will always be the visitor who swans into town, breaks the household rules with forbidden treats and goes away again. I will not be there to listen to whispered hopes and fears, nor will I be a gentle, calm and constant presence in their lives. But I will bring to Sia and Leonard that fierce loyalty for family that Sarah-Jane maintained, rightly or wrongly, as well as her warmth and integrity. I hope to be a strong influence in their lives; to stimulate, excite and support them in every way possible. Perhaps I can show them what a woman can achieve in her lifetime, given the opportunity and a dash of determination.   I suspect many women today grapple with finding a new version of the contemporary grandmother, as they retain a traditional view of a caring woman with little autonomy or life beyond her family. Grandmothers today are likely to be healthy, relatively fit and up for a game of tennis or a ski trip (on the moderate slopes). With some significant exceptions (for example, those who have no superannuation, live alone or have high medical expenses), today's grandmother will have financial means of her own, a career and a fruitful, active life. She will nurture her grandchildren, but will be less passive, more actively engaged with the world, freer to rise to her own potential and, I suggest, happier than many grandmothers in the past, with greater self-confidence. While my generation has been uniquely privileged in so many ways, I believe that, as grandmothers, we should use our remaining years and decades to reach out to our less privileged sisters to bring them with us. Too many women have been left behind. The promises of the '60s and '70s have not been met fully for all Australian women. We grandmothers now have a responsibility to advocate, to be politically active in using our education and financial independence to ensure equality of opportunity and outcome. For all women.   How dismaying that I should have studied for a law degree, a Master of Laws and a PhD, all at the expense of the Australian, American and British taxpayers, while law students today will finish their JD degree $100,000 in debt. As grandmothers, we should be demanding affordable childcare, full superannuation even when on maternity and carers leave, equal pay for equal work, freedom from sexual harassment and bullying in employment, and protection from domestic violence at home. As grandmothers, what do we have to lose? We are not looking for advancement in our careers. We are strong, healthy and independent. Bravo to Grandmothers for Refugees, the Older Women's Network and the scores of other women's advocacy and networking groups. Let us work together to harness the power of today's generation of grandmothers, who can and will speak up for social justice. Let us work together to achieve the vision of gender equality that we and our political leaders had in the 60s and 70s. I like to think that, in Sarah-Jane's quiet way, she would have supported my outspokenness on human rights and forgiven me my notorious media presence. I now understand better the continuing influence she has had on my life, and thank her for it. Postscript: I am about to leave for Geneva to take up a new role in the United Nations as Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. For the first time in my grandchildren's lives, I will be only three hours by train from Paris. It seems one should never say never. Maybe in the future I can be a more real presence in their lives than I had believed possible.

69,/news/2020-04-10/for-these-women-religion-is-an-everyday-part-of-work/12032680,"For these women, religion is an everyday part of work — and they wouldn't change it","No matter which aged care organisation Jihan Lazki works in, as a physiotherapist she's doing the same thing. She's being kind to elderly patients, providing them with the best quality of movement she can, and making their interactions pleasant by chatting and caring. But the religious character of her place of work makes a difference to Jihan's experience. She has worked in a Christian aged care setting in the past, but now works at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first aged care home serving Muslim residents. Jihan says the ethos of respect for the elderly and putting residents' needs first is the same as at any other facility. But she tells me there's something particularly comforting about working in a Muslim organisation.   I spoke to Jihan because I wanted to explore how working within your own religious community can impact a person's sense of belonging and purpose. It can be a fraught discussion — hypotheticals swirled around the Federal Government's religious discrimination bill before coronavirus took over. The second draft of this legislation was released late last year, and changes include allowing religious bodies like hospitals and aged care providers to preference employees who belong to the same religion. The bill says this kind of discrimination is aimed at allowing these organisations to maintain their religious ethos. What I wanted to investigate was something different: employees' experience of working in a religious organisation and the impact of combining work and spiritual beliefs. On the other side of the discussion are people who work in a religious setting without sharing those beliefs. The people I spoke to emphasised the ""Christian values"" and ""Muslim philosophy"" inherent in their work — but these are principles that are shared across religious lines, and of course by people who don't subscribe to any faith at all. Jihan grew up in a Lebanese Muslim household, where her parents taught her the importance of giving back to the community. She works as a physiotherapist at Gallipoli Home, Sydney's first Muslim-focused aged care facility. Staff members speak Turkish, Arabic, Hindi and Urdu to cater to a culturally diverse Muslim community. Residents ""feel at home when they know that someone can speak their language"", Jihan says. Islamic artwork decorates the home, which has dedicated prayer rooms available for residents and staff and sits next door to the Gallipoli Mosque. Staff members organise residents' treatments around their prayer times, mindful of avoiding a clash and maintaining their Muslim rituals.   Reflecting on her previous workplace, Jihan recalls having to navigate social expectations that didn't match up with her religious practices. Though she was a part of the team and liked social outings to celebrate the end of the week, as a non-drinker she felt she had to ""sit on the side"" when colleagues went to the pub. At Gallipoli Home, she says, ""they work around the religious needs that we have"". ""I can pray next door at the mosque, or I can go and pray in the prayer room, whereas at another workplace, you're scrambling to find the storeroom to pray [only] once or twice a day."" This sensitivity to religious practices means there's no extra pressure on employees like Jihan. ""I can order food straight from our kitchen and I know it's halal, whereas over there, you're looking for somewhere to get some halal food."" Breann Fallon sits on the other end of the spectrum — she works at the Sydney Jewish Museum.   ""If you're going to ask me what I tick on the census, I would tick 'other Christian',"" she says. ""Prior to working at the museum, my connections to the Jewish community were pretty much zilch."" Breann says it was a visit during her school years that prompted her interest in working at the museum. The team's ""strong mission to try and learn from the horrors of the past"" appealed to her. And she says it's their shared goal to ""try and turn it into something that we can learn from and create a better world"".   Rather than being excluded, being part of a religious workplace has given Breann a wider view of tradition and culture. ""I've been so accepted by the Jewish community here. At Easter I would do Pesach [Passover] as well as Easter. I celebrate the Jewish High Holidays as well as Christian traditions,"" she says. ""I also see value in philosophies from other faiths as well. So it's a real mixed bag for me."" Tash Holmes works at Uniting, in a job that links churches in the NSW and ACT presbyteries to the community to facilitate social justice programs. She grew up in the Baptist Church and went to a religious high school, then became involved with Hillsong through worship music.   It's been a rather roundabout route to the Uniting Church and an organisation that she says is ""anchored in compassion, respect, being bold and imaginative"". In fact, when she came out several years ago, Tash didn't see a place for herself socially in any church, let alone making her career in the community. She describes realising and sharing that she was gay while a member of Hillsong as ""coming out into a desert land"", and says she didn't know who she could rely on for support. ""There weren't a lot of accepting churches out there. And faith was still important to me,"" she explains. ""I was still wrestling between faith and sexuality and just trying to find a place where you could even talk to someone about it.""   Though she doesn't belong to the Pentecostal group anymore, it's vital for Tash to be visible as a member of the LBGTIQ+ community in a religious context. ""Uniting was the only Christian organisation that would accept me in the workplace and in their churches,"" she says. She knows there are secular social justice organisations that could offer her the same professional fulfilment, but she's able to also meet her spiritual needs through the work that she does. ""I think the church still has a lot of work to do in this space around LGBTI people of faith,"" she says. ""This is my passion. This is this is the work that I want to see out. And there's no other place to do it.""  ",ABC Radio National      By Alice Moldovan for ABC Religion and Ethics,"April 10, 2020"
