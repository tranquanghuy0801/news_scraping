Fake news and misinformation seem to be spreading as fast and as far as the virus itself, infecting our newsfeeds and timelines at this crucial moment. For this reason, RMIT ABC Fact Check has launched CoronaCheck, an email newsletter in which we will bring you the latest in fact-checking from around the world in relation to the coronavirus. You can read the latest edition below, and subscribe to have the next newsletter delivered straight to your inbox. We open today's newsletter with a pointer to our latest fact file, which examines the key differences in COVID-19 containment measures between Australia and Singapore, a country that is often cited as an exemplar in the fight against the coronavirus. We also check in with everyone's new favourite Netflix star, Joe Exotic, aka Tiger King, rumoured to have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and highlight a fake news story emanating from Italy.   Singapore has announced strict new measures around movements and social gatherings. Over the next two days, churches, businesses and schools will close as households are asked to stay home. Why is that significant? Because the Asian city state had been hailed for its efforts to arrest the spread of coronavirus while still affording its residents some semblance of normal life. It's also been held up as a model for Australia's own schools policy.   But while Singapore has been first to move on some measures, it has lagged Australia on others. With infections now on the rise there, and the government anxious about community spread, Fact Check takes a look at what Singapore's been doing and what's changed.   With the country in lockdown, Australians are turning to streaming services such as Netflix to keep them entertained. One runaway hit has been Tiger King: Murder, mayhem and madness, a true crime documentary series about a man named Joe Exotic and the seedy underworld of big-cat breeding. In a true sign of the times, rumours are swirling that the Tiger King himself has been laid low with COVID-19 in a Texas prison. Fact checkers at Snopes and PolitiFact found that while Exotic had not tested positive to the virus, he was in isolation in a new prison after being transferred from a prison facility with confirmed cases. As scientists work to learn all they can about the novel coronavirus, it remains unclear exactly how the virus spreads, causing confusion among the public.   One Facebook post playing into this uncertainty claims the virus has been confirmed as airborne and can remain in the air for up to eight hours. This post has been debunked by fact checkers at PolitiFact, Africa Check and factcheck.org. As experts told health reporters at the ABC, the virus is thought to spread mainly via respiratory droplets, which are secreted when we sneeze or cough, but there's no evidence that these droplets linger for a very long in the air. ""There is no credible evidence at this stage that proved airborne particles could spread the virus in the community,"" La Trobe University epidemiologist Dr Hassan Vally told the ABC. In fact, the World Health Organisation says that these droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and will fall quickly to the floor or surfaces. That's not to say there's no risk of catching the virus from these droplets before they reach a surface — standing too close to a person who coughs or sneezes may put you at risk of breathing in the droplets, which is why social distancing is considered so important. Fact checkers who looked into the claim found one scientific study that suggested that, in some specific hospital settings, the virus could survive (and remain infectious) in the air for three hours.     An article shared widely on Facebook claiming an Italian doctor was arrested for intentionally killing more than 3,000 coronavirus patients is fake news, according to fact checkers at Reuters and PolitiFact. The article claims ""Dr Sergio Kerr"", a ""known member of the Italian opposition Democratic Party"", ignored medical procedures and administered drugs known to worsen pneumonia. But fact checkers found no evidence of such an arrest, and discovered the photo accompanying the article was of an American physician charged with drug offences in 2014. While it certainly sounds like something he would say, US President Donald Trump did not call the coronavirus a ""hoax"", fact checkers at Snopes and Lead Stories have determined. In a news conference on February 28, the President took aim at his political adversaries, saying it was ""their new hoax"" to claim that he wasn't doing anything about the coronavirus.   But audio of the event has been edited to make it appear as if he was calling the existence of the virus a hoax. In one such ad, viewed more than 15 million times on Twitter, a left-leaning lobby group edited the audio to make it appear that Mr Trump said: ""The coronavirus, this is their new hoax."" Lead Stories went on to point out: ""While Trump did not explicitly call the coronavirus a hoax, critics say he downplayed the threat of the virus in the first couple of months of the year, comparing it to the flu, for example.""

1,/news/2020-04-07/comparing-australia-with-singapore-coronavirus/12107106,Singapore is often praised for its coronavirus response. How does it compare to Australia's?,"As the world grapples with COVID-19, Singapore has been praised for its ability to keep a lid on new coronavirus infections without imposing major social and economic restrictions. But with its government now ""very concerned"" by a rise in locally transmitted cases, Singapore has ratcheted up its response.   On April 3 it announced strict new measures to curb further spread. They include shutting non-essential businesses and schools. On some fronts, Singapore took earlier, tougher action than Australia. But now on issues such as outdoor exercise, it is catching up.  So, what has been Singapore's approach to date, and what's changed? RMIT ABC Fact Check examines the key areas of its response.   Singapore had introduced a range of measures into schools before deciding to close them from April 8. On March 19, for example, the government announced ""wipe-down routines"" would be introduced to classes, kids would be assigned seats in the canteen and groups split up in the playground following term break (March 14 to March 23).   Recess times were already being staggered and group activities such as assemblies cancelled, and now any non-classroom activities would also cease. Schools had also been conducting daily temperature checks of students. The decision to close was announced just a week after the government said on March 27 that schools would start transitioning to one day per week of study from home from April 1. Now, all primary and secondary students will move to full ""home-based learning"" and all preschools and kindergartens will ""suspend their general services"". The Ministry of Education said parents ""working in essential services such as healthcare, who are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, may approach their children's primary schools and preschools for assistance"".  Before the closure, Australian political leaders including Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan had pointed to Singapore as a model for Australia's schools policy.     Singapore began temperature screening all plane arrivals from the Chinese city of Wuhan on January 3 and by later that month pre-schools were checking temperatures for all children, staff and visitors. The country reported its first case on January 23, two days before Australia. By January 29, Singapore was temperature screening anyone arriving by land, air or sea and by early February, company employees and even taxi drivers were being screened.   As of February 3, Singapore had conducted more than 300 laboratory tests, with 240 people cleared, 43 ""suspect cases"" waiting on results and 18 cases confirmed. On March 25 the Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said it had a test rate of 6,800 per million people.   At that time Australia had conducted almost 163,000 tests for a population of 25.6 million, a rate of just under 6,400 per million people. Australia has since surpassed Singapore's test rate, which on April 5 stood at 7,000 tests per million people, according to local news reports. By March 31, Australia had conducted 209,000 tests, a rate of nearly 8,200 per million people. Singapore began isolating people from January 20. At first this applied only to those with symptoms travelling from Wuhan and by January 22 to anyone with symptoms travelling from China.  Between February 2 and March 16, it progressively barred visitors from specific countries (China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Spain, France, Germany) and denied entry to cruise ships. On March 24, it shut the door to all visitors, four days after Australia did the same. Locals returning home or foreigners who arrived in Singapore before the bans took effect were initially required to avoid work for 14 days but allowed to leave the house to buy essentials. From February 19, however, the government began issuing stricter ""stay-home notices"". These notices allowed family visitors but forced people to ""remain in their place of residence at all times"", and were soon issued to anyone coming from Italy, Iran or South Korea. By March 21, they were served to anyone returning from abroad.   Locals returning from some countries were subsequently required to serve out their ""stay-home notice"" at a dedicated facility, such as a hotel, rather than in their own residence. Australia introduced self-isolation for all returning travellers on March 16.   Meanwhile, travellers to Singapore from China's Hubei province, along with confirmed cases or their close contacts, were put into full quarantine. That meant no physical interaction with anyone. If that wasn't possible at home, they were sent to a government facility for two weeks. Unlike Australia, Singapore put people with mild symptoms in hospital rather than sending them home to self-isolate. Writing for The Conversation, National University of Singapore's Professor Dale Fisher said that Australia, Europe and the US were sending home ""mild cases"". ""In Singapore, we think it's better to hive those people off and look after them elsewhere until the virus is clear."" On April 5, Singapore's health ministry said it had quarantined a total 17,345 people who had been in close contact with a confirmed case. After the government became more concerned about local transmission, it declared two sites housing almost 20,000 foreign workers to be ""isolation areas"", preventing residents from going to work and restricting recreational activity. The Singapore government has deported and permanently banned foreign workers caught flouting isolation rules and punished their employers. At least one person who breached their stay-home notice has been stripped of their permanent residency. Stay-home notices (for travellers with no symptoms and no suspected contact with confirmed cases) and quarantine orders (for travellers from China's Hubei province or confirmed cases and their close contacts), both have legal force, with breaches attracting fines as high as $10,000 SGD (roughly $11,000 AUD) or up to six months in jail.   Those who don't comply with the stricter quarantine order can also be forced to wear an electronic tag. Lawrence Wong, the head of Singapore's cross-government coronavirus taskforce, has said the government ""will use a whole range of methods to enforce and make sure that there is compliance with the regime."" ""We can do so through video calls, through their phones, identifying where their locations are, through spot checks,"" he said. In Australia, states began introducing legal sanctions for breaching isolation rules on March 16. Singapore has been noted for its ability to quickly track down people who have been in contact, wittingly or not, with someone who has COVID-19. Evaluating Singapore's early response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published research showing contact tracing had identified 53 of the country's first 100 cases, of whom roughly a quarter were caught before showing symptoms. According to local news reports, every day between 30 and 50 Singapore police assist health officials in piecing together timelines and transmission networks by trawling data, scanning CCTV footage and conducting interviews. Those numbers can be quickly doubled if needed, and police are assisted by Singapore's embrace of technology.   On March 20, the government launched an app that records whenever users come near each other. This phone data can be shared if a user develops COVID-19. (The Singapore government says the app requires user consent.) Businesses serving food and drinks have also been encouraged to log customer details using a government registration system. Singapore's government has released potentially identifying personal information alongside each confirmed case, making it possible for others to map the spread of the coronavirus in detail. Australia has been more cautious about releasing personal information, with the expert health advisory panel arguing it may erode public cooperation. Still, there are examples of using technology to track cases. In February, the ABC reported South Australia Police had tracked an infected couple through Adelaide using their phone data for the state's health department. Australia's contact tracing efforts have ramped up since the outbreak of coronavirus, with Victoria boosting its contact tracing personnel from 57 to 230, for example, and the Australian Defence Force starting to assist the states. In January, Singapore established a whole-of-government coronavirus taskforce and on February 16 launched a campaign to raise awareness of good public hygiene. By comparison, Australia launched a public awareness campaign on March 14.  With Singapore's doctors already being asked to write 5-day medical certificates for anyone with respiratory symptoms, on February 18 the government began activating 900 ""public health preparedness clinics"", designed to provide subsidised treatments during outbreaks. More recently, the government has significantly increased its social distancing restrictions. From March 13, gatherings larger than 250 people were ""advised"" to cancel or take precautionary steps. By March 20, they were banned, and anything smaller required at least one metre between people. From March 27, groups larger than 10 were banned and the government closed all bars and entertainment venues like night clubs, cinemas, theatres and karaoke outlets, ""where there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time"".   However, other public venues ""such as retail malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient"" could remain open. On April 3, the government announced that, starting April 7, food and beverage outlets would be restricted to takeaway and delivery only. All attractions, sports and recreation facilities would close, along with churches and non-essential businesses. Sport Singapore, a government agency, said on April 5: ""If you wish to exercise outdoors, exercise on your own or only with members of your own household around your immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places."" Additionally, the government said, ""The general public is advised to stay home and avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in the same household.""  Australia banned outdoor gatherings of 500 people on March 18, began shutting down pubs, gyms and cinemas and restricting restaurants and cafes on March 23, and limited both indoor and outdoor gatherings to two persons only on March 31.     Academics at the University of Oxford have attempted to quantify and compare the steps taken by governments around the world to control the spread of COVID-19.  They have created a composite index tracking the stringency of government responses.  The index tracks seven policy measures — closures of schools, workplaces or public transport, cancellations of events, restrictions on travel or internal movement, and public messaging — and four financial indicators, covering fiscal and monetary measures and public spending on emergency healthcare and vaccines. The authors say: ""Where data for one of the seven indicators are missing, they contribute ""0"" to the index ... Our conservative approach therefore ""punishes"" countries for which less information is available, but also avoids the risk of over-generalizing from limited information."" On the day Singapore recorded its first case, it had a stringency score of 29 out of 100 and Australia scored 7. For most of February, Singapore's score was 33 while Australia's rose to 29. By March 15, the most recent data available for Singapore, it scored 38 while Australia remained on 29. Australia's strongest measures have been introduced since that date, and accordingly its score has risen progressively to 71 on April 2. No comparable figures are yet available for Singapore. Before the outbreak, the 2019 Global Health Security Index — produced by the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, among others — ranked Singapore 11th in the world for countries most prepared to respond to an epidemic, and Australia 10th.

Fake news and misinformation seem to be spreading as fast and as far as the virus itself, infecting our newsfeeds and timelines at this crucial moment. For this reason, RMIT ABC Fact Check has launched CoronaCheck, an email newsletter in which we will bring you the latest in fact-checking from around the world in relation to the coronavirus. You can read the latest edition below, and subscribe to have the next newsletter delivered straight to your inbox. Today's newsletter deals with a crossover of conspiracies as we delve into claims of a connection between 5G and the spread of the coronavirus. We also feature a deep dive into coronavirus stats and data from around the world, written by our own economics and finance editor, Josh Gordon.   And we've taken a break from the White House to bring you the latest from Buckingham Palace. There has been much focus on data in recent weeks, which is understandable. People naturally want to know how Australia is tracking in its fight against coronavirus compared to other countries. Are we managing to flatten the so-called COVID-19 curve? And what lies ahead? Prime Minister Scott Morrison this week suggested the stringent measures put in place to slow the spread of the disease are finally starting to bite. But what can the data really tell us? RMIT ABC Fact Check delved into the numbers, and the assumptions underpinning them. What we found, when it comes to figures such as death rates and case numbers, is the need for an abundance of caution. Online conspiracies linked to the worldwide rollout of 5G technology existed long before the coronavirus pandemic. But now two strands of misinformation are becoming entwined, with some people claiming 5G networks are responsible for the spread of the virus.   Australia's Communications Minister, Paul Fletcher, this week used twitter to pass on a statement from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), saying: ""Suggestions that 5G has caused or is linked to coronavirus are utterly baseless. Spreading this information is reckless."" Meanwhile, fact checkers at Full Fact in the UK debunked three (one, two, three) 5G/coronavirus crossover claims, finding in each case that there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to people's health, and is not linked to the coronavirus. Reuters also investigated these claims, concluding: ""There is no connection between the outbreak of COVID-19 and possible 5G health effects."" And a video supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down by people in China to stop the spread of coronavirus was wrongly captioned, according to Snopes. ""The video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers."" Concerned readers have inquired about all manner of supposed preventions and treatments for the coronavirus, but one has come up more than others: vitamin C.   Fact checkers at factcheck.org and USA Today found that while vitamin C had been proven to reduce marginally the length of a cold, there was no evidence yet that it would be effective in treating COVID-19. Closer to home, Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said it was aware of a report that claimed high-dose vitamin C administered intravenously may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19. ""We have investigated this report and found there is no robust scientific evidence to support the usage of this vitamin in the management of COVID-19,"" it said in an alert. And, on the likelihood of the vitamin being effective, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen, Peter McCaffrey, wrote in The Conversation: ""Although vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it's unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection – or have a large effect at all."" The economic fallout of the coronavirus has drawn comparisons to the Great Depression, which began during the final years of prohibition in America.   But despite rumours to the contrary, it seems we're not headed towards another dry spell, with fact checkers finding claims of alcohol bans in the UK and multiple states in America to be false. PolitiFact found states including Illinois, North Carolina, Mississippi and California had not banned the sale of alcohol, with California actually loosening alcohol rules for restaurants. Also in the US, fact checkers at Lead Stories investigated a similar claim about Florida, and found it originated on a prank website. The same claims are also not true in the UK, according to Reuters. Closer to home, a number of Facebook users seemed to be fooled by an April Fools Day prank, which saw an article declaring bottle shops would close at midnight shared widely. The article was the work of a cyber-security firm, which clearly declared it was a prank, though this would not have been obvious to Facebook users who only read the headline without clicking through. MediaWise is an initiative of the US-based Poynter Institute, which says it's mission is to ""empower people of all ages to be more critical consumers of content online"".   Part of the initiative involves a teen fact-checking network, where dozens of young people work virtually to fact check online content by asking ""is it legit?"", posting the result to Instagram and Tik Tok in order to engage a young audience. If the initiative itself isn't good news enough, the team recently looked at a list of 10 positive coronavirus stories, and found that eight of them were indeed ""legit"" while the remaining two needed more context. The 10 claims included stories on the hunt for a vaccine, a decline in cases in South Korea, and a woman aged 103 making a full recovery from the virus.   No, the Queen does not have coronavirus. With her son Prince Charles now recovered from the virus, and reports that her royal footman (i.e. dog walker) has fallen ill, new rumours suggest the Queen herself, at 93, has been diagnosed with COVID-19. PolitiFact and AFP Fact Check looked into claims the Queen had tested positive for the virus, and found they had no basis in fact. According to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson quoted by AFP, as of March 27 the Queen remained in good health and was ""following all the appropriate advice with regards to her welfare"".

3,/news/2020-04-03/fact-file-are-we-turning-coronavirus-corner-flatten-the-curv/12113410,Scott Morrison says the coronavirus curve is flattening. Are we turning the corner?,"As the spread of the COVID-19 virus wreaks havoc, the question of how Australia is faring compared to other countries — and what might lie ahead — is being much discussed. But with the numbers changing by the day, and with countries fighting and tracking the disease in different ways, the figures can, at best, only tell us so much. At worst, the data has the potential to mislead. On March 30, Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested the stringent measures that had been put in place to slow the spread were finally starting to work.   ""It is clear the epidemiology curve is beginning to flatten,"" Mr Morrison said in a news release. ""But it is too early to determine whether such movements will be significant or sustained."" What can the data usefully tell us? How does Australia compare? And are we starting to flatten the curve? RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a look at the numbers, and the assumptions underpinning them.  We don't know the actual number of COVID-19 cases, only the number of cases confirmed by testing. These are two very different things.   Countries are often compared by tracking the spread of the virus from the time of their 100th confirmed case. This can be useful, because it places different nations at the same starting point, just when the virus is starting to take hold, providing a reference point from which to compare the spread of the disease. But relying on confirmed numbers, as opposed to actual numbers, can be fraught. More on that later. First: the raw data. The following chart compares the number of confirmed cases by country. It uses data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), an agency set up by the European Union in 2004 to track and monitor infectious diseases.   In Australia, the number of confirmed infections has steadily risen. As of April 5, there were 5,687 confirmed cases in Australia. According to estimates released by Oxford University-based organisation Our World In Data, the number of cases in Australia is now doubling every 10 days. This compares to a doubling every six days in the US, where confirmed cases have risen to 312,237 (April 5). The number of infections has risen more slowly elsewhere. In Japan, for example, there are 3,271 confirmed cases, with infections currently doubling every 8 days, while in Singapore there are just 1,189 confirmed cases, with the number doubling every 9 days.  To state the obvious, some countries have much bigger populations. The raw numbers tell us little about the proportional impact. Combining the ECDC figures for the number of confirmed cases with population figures published by the United Nations, it is possible to track the number of confirmed cases per million people, by country.   On this measure, Spain has been proportionately hit hardest, with 2,668 cases per million people, followed by Switzerland (2,367 cases per million people) and Italy (2,061 cases per million people), as at April 5. In the US, there are about 943 cases per million, while in the UK the figure is 617 cases per million. The Scandinavian countries also have high numbers in proportional terms, with 1,016 cases per million people in Norway, 704 in Denmark and 638 in Sweden. Australia currently has recorded about 223 cases per million people. By international standards, that's comparatively low, but still higher than China (57 cases per million), Singapore (203) and Japan (26).  Another way to analyse the impact of the virus is to compare mortality, by country. Again, there are several ways to carve up the figures. Below is a graph comparing the total number of confirmed deaths by country.   By this measure, Italy has been the hardest hit country with 15,362 confirmed deaths, followed by Spain, the US, France, the UK, Iran and China. In Australia, the number of deaths has been comparatively low, with 34 fatalities recorded (as at April 5). What about the rate? This is where things get more complicated. There are a number of ways to analyse the death rate. The first is to look at the number of confirmed deaths, expressed as a proportion of population. On this basis, Australia is still — at this early stage — ahead of many other countries, with about 1.3 deaths per million people.   That compares to 254 confirmed deaths per million people in Italy, 251 in Spain and 116 in France. The US has recorded 26 deaths per million, compared to 2.3 per million reported by China. There is a second type of death rate. This is sometimes referred to as the ""case fatality rate"". This tells us the number of people who are dying as a proportion of confirmed cases. This measure has received a lot of attention, particularly in the media. Case fatality rates appear to vary considerably between countries.   For example, in Australia, at this stage, the case fatality would appear to be relatively low, at 0.6 per cent (April 5). This compares to a case fatality rate as high as 12.3 per cent in Italy, 9.4 per cent (Spain), 10.3 per cent (UK), 4.0 per cent (China) and 2.7 per cent (US). There has been much speculation as to why case mortality rates differ so markedly between countries. Why is the case mortality rate, for example, relatively low in Germany (1.5 per cent) and Norway (0.9 per cent), but 5.8 per cent in Sweden and 11.0 per cent in France?  The reality is that, as a measure, the case mortality rate should be treated with an abundance of caution. Crucially, the case fatality rate is not the same as an actual mortality rate. It can only tell us the number of deaths as a proportion of confirmed cases, and at a particular point in time. First, the number of actual cases may differ wildly to the number of confirmed cases, particularly if testing rates are low.   As the World Health Organisation defines it, a ""confirmed case"" represents a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. A recent article published in the science journal Nature cites estimates suggesting that asymptomatic or mild cases could represent about 40 to 50 per cent of all infections. The point is, at this stage we simply don't know how many people are infected with the virus. So, countries with limited levels of testing might appear to have higher mortality rates — particularly if that limited testing is being restricted to those patients with more severe symptoms. Data relating to testing can be sketchy and difficult to compare. But what is clear is that test rates between countries can vary dramatically. At this stage, Australia appears to have one of the highest testing rates in the world. According to the Department of Health, Australia has now conducted more than 268,000 tests as at April 1. That implies a cumulative testing rate of more than 10,551 tests per million. According to other figures complied by Our World in Data, the testing rate in the US is now 3,345 per million, the UK (2,126), Italy (8,573) and South Korea (7,971). Although these figures are not directly comparable due to different testing methodologies, the data shows how widely testing varies between countries.  In an article in The Conversation, Sanjaya Senanayake, an associate professor of medicine and infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University, says variations in case fatality rates between countries ""may partially be explained by whether hospitals have been overwhelmed or not"". Even with relatively high testing rates, in countries severely affected by the crisis, such as Italy, it is probable that testing is confirming the more severe cases while failing to identify less severe ones. This might explain Italy's alarmingly high case fatality rate (currently 12.3 per cent). There is a second important reason why comparing case fatality rates could be fraught. Case fatality rates tend to change over time, often dramatically. So, taking a single rate, at a single point in time, and using it as a basis to compare countries or to estimate the likelihood of dying can be misleading. Different countries are at different stages in terms of the progression of the virus, as the following chart demonstrates.   One recent study published by medical journal The Lancet, estimated it takes an average of 17.8 days from when a person first experiences symptoms of COVID-19 to when they die. The World Health Organisation's Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) found in fatal cases it took patients between two and eight weeks to die. The implication is that many people who are currently recorded as infected will eventually show up in the fatality statistics. This could cause the case fatality rate to rise over time. As another article published in the American Journal of Epidemiology put it: ""Simple estimates of the case fatality ratio ... can be misleading if, at the time of analysis, the outcome is unknown for a nonnegligible proportion of patients.""   This is what happened during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As has been pointed out, during the early stage of the SARS outbreak, the case fatality rate was estimated at 3 to 5 per cent. By the end, the estimates had been revised up to 9.6 per cent. During the SARS epidemic, the rise in the case fatality rate initially led some people to wrongly conclude that the disease had evolved and was becoming more deadly over time. But as medical studies later established, this was not the case. Rather, it simply took time for some people to die. The same could conceivably be true of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In proportional terms, Australia is, at this stage, being hit less severely by the virus than many other countries. And, as Mr Morrison has noted, there are some early promising signs that the daily rate of increase is slowing, though the total numbers are still rising and the situation is changing rapidly. In reality, relying on figures such as confirmed case numbers and case fatality rates is likely to paint a misleading picture. Australia and the rest of the world won't be able to properly assess the disease until we have a sound understanding of the final numbers of deaths and actual infections. That will require both time — potentially months, even years — and extensive research.

We've also looked at a couple of rumours which won't go away—that China (or another party) created and released the coronavirus and that petrol pumps are ""super spreaders"" of the disease.   One pervasive coronavirus conspiracy theory suggests the virus was ""created"" in order to bring down economies and achieve world domination. In most cases, the theories suggest China is behind the purposeful spread of the virus, which is sometimes referred to as a bioweapon. Readers have pointed to one such theory, spread on Facebook, which claims, among other things:     ""China's vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE."" Conservative lobby group Advance Australia have also published an article detailing a theory that the virus may have ""escaped from"" a military laboratory in Wuhan. There's currently no evidence to suggest the coronavirus originated anywhere other than in nature.  Fact checkers at USA Today looked to a recent report from the Scripps Research Institute which concluded that the coronavirus ""mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins."" And in a statement published in the medical journal The Lancet, public health scientists from across the globe said they had also decided ""overwhelmingly … that this coronavirus originated in wildlife"". Meanwhile, PolitFact found no evidence to support a claim that COVID-19 was created in a lab, adding that ""scientists who have isolated the genetic makeup of the 2019 coronavirus say its likely source is bats"".   In potentially distressing news for asthma sufferers, a claim that Australians with pre-existing respiratory conditions are entitled to a ""rescue pack"" from their GP is a viral piece of misinformation originally spread in the UK, according to AAP Fact Check.   A Department of Health spokesperson told AAP: ""Patients cannot receive a 'rescue pack' from their GP, unless previously prescribed."" The Lung Foundation of Australia also addressed the claims on its website:  ""This scheme is not available in Australia and people living with asthma or COPD unfortunately cannot receive a pack from a pharmacy, GP or hospital at this point.""  Reuters debunked the same claim when it spread throughout the UK. Headlines declaring that studies of the ill-fated Diamond Princess cruise ship showed that the coronavirus could survive on surfaces up to 17 days were misleading, according to fact checkers. PolitiFact found that while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had detected traces of the virus 17 days after cruise ship passengers had vacated their cabins, these were parts of viral RNA and not the live virus.  Dr Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at Yale University, told PolitiFact: ""A piece of viral RNA is not the same thing as a live infectious virus. In order for a virus to be infectious, it has to have intact membrane, spike protein and the whole intact genome (there are close to 30,000 bases of genetic code in the viral genome)."" We've had a fair number of emails asking about petrol pumps and whether they are ""super spreaders"". These emails appear to be the result of messages shared on Facebook and Whatsapp claiming the pumps are responsible for coronavirus being spread widely.   The ABC looked into the claims earlier this week and found no public health authorities in Australia had issued specific warnings about petrol pumps. A spokesperson for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Queensland, which has been cited in some posts and messages as a source of the petrol pumps claim, told the ABC the text message was a ""complete fake"". However, health authorities continue to advise that people should regularly and thoroughly wash their hands after touching any public surface. AFP Fact Check also debunked the claim, while Snopes and USA Today looked at similar claims in the US.     Readers who have been keeping up to date with CoronaCheck will have noticed there is a lot of misinformation and fake news circulating about coronavirus.  RMIT ABC Fact Check will continue to bring you as much factual information as possible, but it's also important that you stay vigilant to stop fake news spreading in the first place.  As part of the ABC Education program, Fact Check has previously produced a series of interactive lessons to help you spot, verify and debunk information. While originally designed for use in high schools, the series is perfect for anyone looking to improve their fact-checking skills. Helpfully, some of our IFCN friends have also put together guides to help spot misinformation online:  ""I know South Korea better than anybody,"" US President Donald Trump declared during a recent coronavirus briefing. ""You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is?"" the President asked, before answering his own question. ""Thirty-eight million people. That's bigger than anything we have; 38 million people all tightly wound together."" However, as Snopes pointed out, Seoul has a population of 9.8 million people or 25 million people if you're including the greater metropolitan area. It's unclear where President Trump got the figure of 38 million from, but it does closely match the population of the greater Tokyo area.  Got a fact that needs checking?

5,/news/2020-04-01/corona-check-ibuprofen-vaccine-pets/12105792,"Ibuprofen, furry friends and a COVID-19 vaccine. Coronavirus misinformation, debunked","As the world grapples with an unprecedented health crisis, it is now more important than ever to ensure that the information we share is accurate and fact-based. Fake news and misinformation seem to be spreading as fast and as far as the virus itself, infecting our newsfeeds and timelines at this crucial moment. For this reason, RMIT ABC Fact Check has launched CoronaCheck, an email newsletter in which we will bring you the latest in fact-checking from around the world in relation to the coronavirus. You can read the latest edition below, and subscribe to have the next newsletter delivered straight to your inbox. Thank you to the many readers who have sent emails alerting us to a variety of claims regarding the coronavirus. The claim that we have received most emails about relates to ibuprofen and whether it has an adverse affect on people who contract COVID-19, so that's where we begin this edition of the newsletter.   We also take a look at how the virus affects our furry friends and feature an RMIT ABC Fact Check fact file on workers without paid leave. This newsletter draws on our own resources and those of our colleagues within the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), of which RMIT ABC Fact Check is a member. Many people have sent us versions of a text claiming that ""information from Vienna's laboratory studying COVID-19"" suggests that the ""vast majority"" of people dying from coronavirus have ibuprofen in their systems.   Fact checkers have been unable to find a basis for this claim, and the Medical University of Vienna has called it ""fake news"". Additionally, a spokesperson for Vancouver Coastal Health, which is also cited in the post as advising against ibuprofen, told the ABC, the hospital had not issued advice to that effect ""at all"". PolitiFact, Full Fact and BBC Reality Check found there had not been enough research to know whether ibuprofen had any adverse affect on coronavirus sufferers Some experts noted, however, that ibuprofen could compromise the body's immune response.  Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration says it is aware of anecdotal reports around ibuprofen and coronavirus and will continue to monitor the issue. ""We have investigated this safety concern and found that there is currently no published peer-reviewed scientific evidence to support a direct link between use of ibuprofen and more severe infection with COVID-19.""   Britain's National Health Service currently recommends taking paracetamol unless a person has been instructed by their doctor that paracetamol is unsuitable for them. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation says it ""does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen"". Images reminiscent of the Great Depression dominated the media in the past week, with newly unemployed Australians queuing outside Centrelink offices in a bid to access welfare payments. Many were likely to be workers without paid leave entitlements, such as casuals and the self-employed. RMIT ABC Fact Check examined the issue of insecure work in a fact file published this week. We found that combining the estimated number of self-employed workers with those in casual employment suggests as many as 4.8 million Australian workers (37 per cent of the national workforce) did not have access to paid leave entitlements in the lead-up to the coronavirus outbreak. Many of us stuck at home are taking comfort in the fact that we get to spend more time with our favourite four-legged friends.   Some people have expressed concern, however, that our pets may be able to pass on the coronavirus to humans. A number of fact checks — by our IFCN colleagues at USA Today, Africa Check, PolitiFact and Full Fact, among others — found that while at least one dog did test ""weak positive"" for coronavirus in Hong Kong, there were questions over the validity of the test and no evidence pets could transmit the virus to humans. Scientists around the world, including researchers at the University of Queensland, are hard at work on a COVID-19 vaccine. But posts shared on social media claiming a vaccine is ready for use are false, according to fact checkers at Full Fact and Reuters. The image included in the posts, which appears to show a packaged vaccine, is actually a photo of a COVID-19 testing kit.  The Department of Health says that, according to the WHO, a publicly available vaccine is 18 months away.   March 24 was a busy day for US President Donald Trump, who spent much of his time in front of the camera appearing in a Fox News ""virtual town hall"", a Fox News interview, and in a televised daily coronavirus task force briefing.   IFCN-accredited fact checkers at the Washington Post ran the rule over the President's entire day, and found that of the 11 claims made by Mr Trump that they checked, most were either false or misleading. Take, for example, his claim that it was his ""instinct"" that led him to block people coming into the US from China, and that ""almost everybody"" was against the idea. The Post found this narrative conflicted with reports of how the decision was reached and who was on board (staff from the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Department, for instance), and that the President was reluctant when the idea was first presented to him.

Fake news and misinformation seem to be spreading as fast and as far as the virus itself, infecting our newsfeeds and timelines at this crucial moment.

Read the latest edition below, and subscribe to have the next newsletter delivered straight to your inbox. Our colleagues from the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) have been covering a lot of ground, from lions in Russia to shoppers in Australia. In this edition of CoronaCheck we've covered what to do if you're feeling ill (hint — it's unlikely to involve Facebook advice) and investigated a viral email claiming to be from the Royal Melbourne Hospital. We've also checked in with the US presidential election race, and brought you a light-hearted story from Belgium. While teams of researchers around the world are working at full throttle to develop a coronavirus vaccine, Australians are heading to their local GP for this year's flu shot. But one Facebook post, shared more than 2,500 times, claims that the flu vaccine increases your chances of getting the coronavirus by 36 per cent.  The claim has been deemed false by the fact checkers at Lead Stories, who quoted Dr David Webber, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, as saying: ""The influenza vaccine neither protects against coronavirus nor increases one's risk of catching it."" The Royal Melbourne Hospital has taken to Twitter to distance itself from a message circulating online attributed to a ""friend who works for the Royal Melbourne Hospital in HR"".   The message contains a number of claims, including that sipping water will help ""destroy"" the virus (debunked here) and that being able to breathe deeply is a sign that a person is not infected (debunked here). The hospital labelled the message ""completely false"" and said: ""This is not from the Royal Melbourne Hospital or the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital @MetroNorthHHS and the details are untrue."" A collective madness seems to have gripped Australia, as evidenced by supermarket shelves left bare in the wake of an onslaught of panic shoppers. One video shared on social media in recent days appears to show shoppers stockpiling baby formula at a Melbourne supermarket. The video, posted to YouTube on March 18, is undated. Captions and comments on Facebook posts that feature the video suggest some viewers assumed the footage was captured during the coronavirus outbreak. But our IFCN-accredited colleagues at AFP Fact Check determined that while the video does show shoppers buying tins of formula, it was originally published on December 21, 2019 — more than a week before the first reported cases of coronavirus. Struggling with the thought of being locked inside your house for the foreseeable future? Tempted to sneak outside for a break? What if there were lions outside patrolling the streets? Would you want to leave?   One viral story, complete with photos, claims that President Vladimir Putin released more than 500 lions onto Russian streets in order to keep people inside during the coronavirus pandemic. Fact checkers at Reuters and Rappler marked the story as false and identified the photo of a lion on city streets as having been taken in South Africa in 2016, when the animal was allowed to wander through Johannesburg as part of a film production.  Confused about what to do if you think you might have coronavirus? Incorrect advice and misinformation being spread on social media may be partly to blame.   Take, for example, a Facebook post claiming that Australians who call their local ""communicable disease control branch"" would be seen at home by a doctor for free. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that's because it is, according to AFP Fact Check, which found no evidence of any Australian state offering free GP visits.  If you do feel unwell and have symptoms matching those of coronavirus, the number you should call is the National Coronavirus Helpline: 1800 020 080 ""People who have never died before are now dying from coronavirus."" That's the nonsensical quote being attributed to both President Trump and his likely opponent in this year's US presidential election, Joe Biden. But which one of them actually said it?  Neither, according to Politifact, which found no evidence of the quote being used in any speech, campaign ad or media interview by either man. They did discover, however, that Ernest Hemingway was apparently fond of the phrase (sans the coronavirus reference, of course). No, Belgium's health minister did not ban ""non-essential group sex"", though it might be a good idea to put such activities on hold for now.   That particular piece of fake news, contained in an article by World News Daily Report, was taken as gospel and shared widely on social media, including by verified accounts on Twitter.  But, as The Quint discovered, the article was actually satire — the tagline of World News Daily Report is ""where facts don't matter"". We'll keep saying it until it sticks: check the source!

7,/news/2020-03-30/fact-file-casual-employment-paid-leave-entitlements/12089056,COVID-19 has put jobs in danger. How many workers don't have leave entitlements?,"As the world struggles to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, workers without paid leave entitlements are clearly among the most vulnerable in the sudden economic downturn.  Many thousands have already lost their jobs, while others face the prospect of unpaid time off should they need to self-isolate or become sick, can no longer work from home or their places of work are shuttered in response to increasingly strict bans on gatherings.  But how many such workers are there in Australia?   The ACTU has repeatedly said 3.3 million Australians, or one in three workers, are ""casuals, contractors, labour hire and gig workers"", a number repeated by Labor politicians such as Tanya Plibersek, Tony Burke and Linda Burney. Others, such as Labor's Stephen Jones and Attorney General Christian Porter, have suggested the proportion of the workforce made up of casual workers is closer to one in four.  So, which count is correct? In this fact file, RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a look at casual workers and others without paid leave — how their work is defined, how many there are, and what their entitlements include. As Fact Check has previously pointed out, there is no formal legal definition of casual employment.  Rather, casual employment ""has generally been regarded as employment in which there is an absence of entitlement to paid annual leave or sick leave"", according to a guide published by the Australian Parliamentary Library.   This is the definition used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as its primary measure of casual employment, data for which is contained in the bureau's annual publication Characteristics of Employment.  ""An employee with paid leave entitlements has access to either paid holiday leave or paid sick leave, or both,"" the ABS says.  ""An employee is considered to be without leave entitlements if they identify as not having access to both paid sick leave and holiday leave, or did not know their entitlements.  ""This is an objective measure that can be collected consistently.""  Along with a lack of paid leave, casual employees generally have no guaranteed hours of work, work irregular hours and can have their employment ended without notice, according to the Fair Work Ombudsman.  To compensate, casual workers receive a higher hourly rate of pay that includes a so-called casual loading, usually amounting to an additional 25 per cent.  Casuals are also entitled to some unpaid leave, such as two days of carer's or compassionate leave per occasion, and 5 days' unpaid family and domestic violence leave within a 12-month period.   According to the latest Characteristics of Employment figures from the ABS, there were 2.6 million employees in Australia without paid leave entitlements in August 2019, compared to 8.1 million employees with paid leave entitlements.  That puts the rate of casual work at 24 per cent, in line with the proportion cited by Mr Porter and Mr Jones.  It's important to note that this rate only includes employees and not all workers — self-employed Australians and the owners of businesses with employees are not included in this measure.  As a proportion of all workers in Australia — of which there are around 12.8 million — casual workers make up 20 per cent, or one in five.  In April 2018, Fact Check found that a claim, made by then workplace and deregulation minister Craig Laundy, that the rate of casualisation of the Australian workforce had remained steady at 25 per cent over the past 20 years, checked out.  ""The lie is that the rate of insecure work in this country is lifting,"" Mr Laundy said. ""It's not. It's completely where it was 20 years ago.""  In checking Mr Laundy's claim, Fact Check found that since 1997 around 24 to 25 per cent of all employees were employed on a casual basis, according to ABS data.  The same sources of data used in checking that claim have now been updated to include 2018 and 2019, showing employees without paid leave entitlements continued to account for around 24 per cent of all employees.  But while the rate of casualisation has remained steady for the past couple of decades, experts have previously pointed to a marked increase that occurred in the late 1980s and early 90s.  John Quiggin, from the School of Economics at the University of Queensland, said the impact of recession and weakening of unions explained the growth and eventual stabilisation of the extent of casual employment.  ""In general, the period from the 1980s to the mid-1990s was one in which workers lost ground over working conditions,"" he said. ""The prevalence of long working hours, unpaid overtime and casualisation all increased.  ""This reflected the combined effects of two major recessions and the weakening of unions, both of which weakened workers' bargaining power. The gradual improvement in the labour market since the mid-1990s has led to a stabilisation, but no improvement [in casualisation rates].""   It's not just casual workers who are likely to be forced to take leave without pay as coronavirus takes hold: self-employed Australians also lack the paid-leave entitlements available to employees on part-time or full-time contracts.  A Grattan Institute blog post authored by the director of its Household Finances Program, Brendan Coates, and senior associate Matt Cowgill, put the number of self-employed Australians at 2.2 million.  Mr Cowgill told Fact Check this number included ""people whose status in employment is either owner-manager of incorporated business, or owner-manager of unincorporated business"" and would generally include those working in the gig economy, such as Uber drivers.  He added that international guidelines for classifying employment had been revised in a way that would make it easier to separately identify people in the gig economy.  ""These classification guidelines have not yet been adopted in Australia,"" he said.  The ACTU's claim that 3.3 million Australian workers were without paid leave entitlements is likely an understatement.  Combining the estimated number of self-employed workers with those in casual employment would suggest as many as 4.8 million Australian workers, or 37 per cent of the national workforce, did not have access to paid leave entitlements in the lead-up to the coronavirus outbreak.  The University of Melbourne's Jeff Borland told Fact Check that combining these figures ""seems like a sensible approach"" and the method was ""a good way to calculate the total number of workers who don't have paid leave in their main job"".  Professor Borland, who researches labour markets in Australia, added: ""There shouldn't be any overlap as they are mutually exclusive categories in the ABS data collection for that survey.""  The figure includes labour hire workers, contractors and workers in the gig economy as referenced in claims made by the ACTU and Labor politicians such as Tanya Plibersek, and more closely aligns with claims that one in three workers have no paid leave.   According to a statistical snapshot published by the Parliamentary Library in 2018, casual employees are likely to be younger and work in the hospitality and retail industries.  ""Young workers aged 15 to 24 years are much more likely to be contracted on a casual basis compared with people aged 25 to 64 years,"" the snapshot says.  ""Some industries such as hospitality and retail trade have very high concentrations of casual workers, while others such as the finance sector have much lower rates.""  The Grattan Institute blog post concurs.  ""Young people are disproportionately likely to be in casual work and not have paid leave,"" Mr Coates and Mr Cowgill say.  ""But casual work is not just for young people who are putting themselves through university. More than a quarter of people in their 30s, 40s and 50s do not have paid sick leave — either because they're casual workers or they're self-employed.""  Mr Coates and Mr Cowgill found that most workers without paid leave were in industries ""especially vulnerable to shutdown"" such as cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services.  ""Not many of the 20 industries with the largest number of workers without paid leave entitlements are likely to be able to continue as normal over a period of widespread self-isolation,"" they said.

This is why RMIT ABC Fact Check is launching CoronaCheck, an email newsletter in which we will bring you the latest in fact-checking from around the world in relation to the coronavirus.  Subscribe and keep reading for a taste of what's to come. Today we've looked at how misinformation is being shared and by whom — something which can be very hard to track once false information goes viral.   We've also got some bad news about those photos of wild animals in the canals of Venice, and we'll bring you an update from the White House. In addition, we've included a fact check — which we're sure will be the first of many — debunking an ""apparent"" cure for the virus.   A Facebook post, shared more than 100,000 times, claims a factory in Footscray is hoarding grocery items to be sent overseas. But Victoria Police have discredited the post. In a Facebook post of their own they said: ""We are aware of a social media post being shared claiming a freight company was stockpiling food and sanitary items in a Footscray factory for overseas export. Police have spoken to the company and found these claims to be false."" While we know there is plenty of misinformation around about the coronavirus, as evidenced by this newsletter, it can be very hard to tell where a lot of it is coming from. But in an op-ed for Wired, Gabby Deutch from online trust website NewsGuard writes that she and her colleagues were able to track one fake article — ""Coronavirus Bioweapon–How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It"" — back to its source.   It's a fascinating read, and a good example of how fake news goes viral and why it's so hard to track. Some of the misleading coronavirus news is also being shared by climate change deniers, according to Desmog, a website devoted to spreading accurate climate science. A claim attributed to Stanford University that being able to hold your breath for ten seconds ""proves there is no (COVID-19 caused) Fibrosis in the lungs"" has been deemed false by a number of fact checkers, including Africa Check, AP, Full Fact and USA Today. Before you try the ""test"" out at home, know that Stanford University has said the information did not come from them and as one expert put it: ""Most young patients with Coronavirus will be able to hold their breaths for much longer than 10 seconds. And many elderly without the virus won't be able to do it.   In news that is a bit disheartening, those photos of dolphins and swans swimming in the canals of Venice are misleading, according to National Geographic and fact checkers at The Quint. The photos of dolphins were actually taken in Sardinia, hundreds of kilometres away, and the swans were in Burano, in the greater Venice area, where they have been for 20 years.   In tragic news a man is dead and his wife is making a recovery in the US after they ingested a version of chloroquine, a substance Donald Trump falsely claimed had been approved to treat coronavirus. President Trump claimed at a press conference on March 19 that the US would be making chloroquine, used to treat malaria, ""available almost immediately"" and that it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.   But according to AP Fact Check, CNN's Facts First, and factcheck.org, the FDA is only investigating whether the drug can be used to treat COVID-19 and has not approved it as a treatment for the disease.   Those fact checks clearly didn't reach one American couple, who ingested a parasite treatment for pet fish containing chloroquine phosphate after seeing Mr Trump's comments on TV. A doctor at the clinic which treated the couple offered some good advice:  ""You need to listen to the scientists.""  ",RMIT ABC Fact Check,"March 27, 2020"
9,/news/2020-03-12/fact-check-pauline-hanson-transgender-children-census/12044974,Pauline Hanson says just 57 students under the age of 15 identified as transgender in the census. Is she correct?,"One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has introduced her Australian Education Legislation Amendment (Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children) Bill to the Parliament, telling the Senate ""some teachers and schools [are] pushing the idea that a child's biological sex does not determine whether you are male or female"". ""How many transgender children are there in schools in Australia?"" the senator asked.   ""According to the 2016 census, just 57 students under the age of 15 identified as transgender."" Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check finds out. Senator Hanson's claim is wrong. The 2016 census did not contain a question on whether or not respondents identified as transgender. Rather, a question asked: ""is [the person] male, female or other?"" Of the responses to that question for people aged 0 to 14, ""other"" accounted for 57. This figure does not account for respondents who may have reported as male or female, but whose sex assigned at birth did not match that response. The Australian Bureau of Statistics makes clear the census statistics are not an accurate representation of the true number of trans and gender diverse people in Australia. This is because people completing the census had to take extra steps to access a specialised form with an option to answer other than male or female. Further, the ABS state that ""people who have been treated with disrespect, abuse and discrimination because of their sex or gender may be unwilling to reveal their sex in an official document"". Experts also noted that transgender people may be more likely to select the option aligning with their gender identity rather than the 'other' option on a form such as the census. While there is no official count of transgender people in Australia, experts pointed Fact Check to a number of sources which indicated far more than 57 young Australians identified as trans or gender diverse. For example, the Royal Children's Hospital Gender Service in Melbourne, Australia's largest such service, had 267 referrals in 2018 of children under 18 identifying as transgender, the bulk of whom would have been aged under 15, according to a spokeswoman for the service. And while not a count of students under 15, a 2019 survey of older Australian secondary students found 2.3 per cent identified as transgender. Further, a 2014 New Zealand study found 1.2 per cent of secondary students identified as transgender.   Firstly, it is important to understand the difference between ""sex"" and ""gender"". According to the Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender, sex refers to ""the chromosomal, gonadal and anatomical characteristics associated with biological sex"". Meanwhile, ""Gender is part of a person's social and personal identity. It refers to each person's deeply felt internal and individual identity and the way a person presents and is recognised within the community,"" the guidelines state. ""A person's sex and gender may not necessarily be the same."" When it comes to the definition of ""transgender"", advocacy groups say it is a broad term used to describe a number of gender identities. Trans and gender diverse advocacy group Transgender Victoria says transgender people have gender identities and expressions that differ from their sex assigned at birth. ""For example, someone who was assigned male at birth and is transgender may be female, genderqueer, non-binary, agender, or any other gender that is not male,"" a document on the group's website says. ""Transgender is often used as an umbrella term, either on its own or as part of the larger term 'trans and gender diverse', but may also be used as a gender in and of itself."" Similarly, a 2017 report on the mental health experiences of young trans people says that ""trans individuals describe their gender in different ways"". ""Trans people generally experience or identify their gender as not matching their sex assigned at birth. This includes people who identify as transgender, non-binary, agender, genderqueer and more,"" the report, from the Telethon Kids Institute, states. Media representiative for Transgender Victoria Sally Goldner told Fact Check the term ""trans and gender diverse"" encompasses anyone whose sense of identity and expression differed from expectations given their sex assigned at birth, but that the general public would likely understand ""transgender"" to fit this definition.  An ABS information page regarding sex and gender diversity in the 2016 census contains the following definitions: The Australian Census of Population and Housing has included a question on sex since its inception in 1911. The latest census, conducted in 2016, was the first to include an option to answer that question with 'other', as well as the traditional options of 'male' and 'female'. As explained by the ABS, neither the standard paper nor online census forms in 2016 allowed households to select an option for sex other than male or female. An ABS spokesman told Fact Check, ""respondents generally needed to take extra steps and have knowledge of special procedures to report their sex as other than male or female"". When completing the census online, households needed to contact the ABS, either by phone or online, to receive a code which would grant them access to a specialised version of the online form including the ""other"" option. To understand how to nominate an answer other than male or female on the paper census form, households needed to take initiative to access ""how to answer"" instructions, which were available on the ABS website or in fact sheets.   These instructions explained respondents could leave the male and female boxes unticked on the paper form and write in the space next to those boxes instead. While Senator Hanson's claim relates to the number of respondents who identified as transgender, the census did not ask specifically whether respondents identified as transgender. The ABS information page regarding sex and gender diversity in the 2016 census shows the question as it appeared on the online and paper census forms. The ABS notes that the census question does not specifically mention sex or gender and explains that it reports the results as pertaining to ""sex/gender"" as ""many [people] did not give enough information to determine which"" they were referring to in their answer. According to the ABS page on sex and gender diversity in the 2016 census, ""some 1,260 people were considered to have provided a valid and intentional sex/gender diverse response"". A table on that information page shows 4.5 per cent of the total number of reported sex/gender diverse people were aged 0-14 years. That's 57 young sex/gender diverse people. This number was confirmed to Fact Check to be correct by an ABS spokesman.   While it would be correct to say just 57 people aged under 15 were reported as sex/gender diverse in the 2016 census, the ABS warns that this figure is not an accurate count of the true number of transgender and gender diverse Australians. ""[This is] due to limitations around the special procedures and willingness or opportunity to report as sex and/or gender diverse,"" the ABS page on gender diversity in the census states. The ""special procedures"" are those described above. It says the total figure for all ages of 1,260 ""is a minimum estimate and is expected to have been substantially under-reported"". The ABS spokesman also explained that the census count is inaccurate in part because ""people who have been treated with disrespect, abuse and discrimination because of their sex or gender may be unwilling to reveal their sex in an official document"". In addition, the ABS information page notes: ""In households, it is common for one person to complete responses on behalf of other household members, who may not know or respect how these other household members would report their sex or gender."" In addition to the census not asking specifically whether respondents identify as transgender, experts told Fact Check transgender people would not necessarily select the ""other"" option when filling in the form. ""I think overwhelmingly trans women such as myself would put 'female' and trans men would put 'male', Ms Goldner said. ""The non-binary people, given all the hassle, the problems with the census generally, might have given up and perhaps classified themselves inaccurately."" Kerry Robinson, leader of the Sexualities & Genders Research cluster at the Western Sydney University School of Social Sciences, agreed. ""Many transgender people would select 'male' or 'female' — i.e. the gender that is affirming of their identity — rather than 'other',"" Professor Robinson told Fact Check in an email. ""In which case, they would be rendered invisible in the census. However, some may select 'other'. It is hard to account for trans people in such contexts, so numbers would not be accurate and would be an underestimate.""   David Rhodes, a senior lecturer in the School of Education at Edith Cowan University, noted that it was likely to be parents filling out the census form on behalf of transgender children under the age of 15, which could also affect the accuracy. Dr Rhodes, whose research broadly focuses on social justice issues in education, added there had been more effort in recent years, particularly in the corporate sector, to be more inclusive of the transgender community. ""To put [the 2016 census] in context, that was before the marriage equality debate, and I think we've come a long way since 2016."" Both Ms Goldner and Professor Robinson noted there were human rights problems associated with the failure to collect information trans and gender diverse communities. In terms of the 2016 census, Ms Goldner said: ""You had to ring up to get a special link and password to use the 'other' option, and given we've had federal anti-discrimation law since August 2013 that recognises gender identity other than male female, it was discrimination."" A spokeswoman for the Royal Children's Hospital Gender Service in Melbourne provided Fact Check with figures for the number of transgender-identifying adolescents presenting to the service. Those figures show 267 young people up to the age of 17 were referred to the gender service in 2018. In 2016, that number was 226.   The spokeswoman told Fact Check most of those referred to the service would be younger than 15, with the median age of patients who were assigned female at birth being 14.8 years and those assigned male at birth having a median age of 12.4 years. She added that the Royal Children's Hospital's Gender Service was the biggest in Australia and that similar services in Brisbane and Perth would likely see approximately half to two-thirds of the referrals in Melbourne. A spokeswoman for the Government of Western Australian Child and Adolescent Health Service provided Fact Check with a statement regarding the number of young people referred to the state's gender diversity service. ""As of July 2019, there were 97 young people aged 9 to 17 years receiving gender affirming treatment at Perth Children's Hospital Gender Diversity Service. These young people identify as transgender. ""Over the past six years (2014 to 2019) 608 young people were referred to the Perth Children's Hospital Gender Diversity Service. 353 of these referrals were for children under 15 years of age."" Experts pointed Fact Check to a number of sources for an estimate of transgender children in Australia. The first, a 2014 New Zealand study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, found that of more than 8,000 surveyed secondary students, 1.2 per cent reported identifying as transgender while a further 2.5 per cent reported being not sure about their gender. More recently, a June 2019 report from the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University, surveyed more than 6,000 Australian Year 10, 11 and 12 students. That report found that 2.3 per cent of the students surveyed, though likely almost all aged older than 15, identified as trans or gender diverse. If that figure held true for all senior secondary school students in Australia in 2018, 11,238 would have identified as transgender. However, Dr Rhodes told Fact Check older secondary students would be more likely to identify as transgender, as they have experienced or are experiencing puberty, and are more mature. ""They may have more confidence, or access to more support in this area as they grow older and mature, and have a greater sense of their own identity and sexuality,"" he said. Another report, commissioned by NSW Health, found 1.9 per cent of 1416 NSW residents aged 12 to 24 and surveyed in 2016 and 2017 identified as 'other' rather than male or female. In comparison, the 57 young people counted as sex/gender diverse in the 2016 census made up 0.0013 per cent of the total number (4,364,608) of children aged under 15.

10,/news/2020-03-06/fact-check-craig-kelly-rainfall-drought/12016214,Craig Kelly says Australia had more rainfall in the first 20 years of this century than the first 20 years of last century. Is he correct?,"At the height of Australia's recent bushfire crisis, Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly made the rounds of national and international media outlets. In a combative exchange with meteorologist Laura Tobin on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Kelly argued against the long-term drying out of the Australian landscape.   Ms Tobin said: ""Australia have just had, in 2019, their highest year temperature-wise ever recorded and their driest year ever recorded, with forecasts and temperatures that go back over 100 years."" Mr Kelly responded: ""There's a few issues there. Firstly, the first 20 years of this century we've had more rainfall in Australia than [over] the first 20 years of the last century."" He expanded on the claim on his Facebook page, writing: ""As climate scientists acknowledge, and anyone that can read a graph understands — although there are regional variations, across a [sic] 120 years of data, as Co2 has increased there has been no nationwide drying trend."" So, has Australia had more rainfall this century, compared to the first 20 years of the last century? And does the data show there is no nationwide drying trend? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. Mr Kelly's claim is flawed. Data collected by the Bureau of Meteorology shows an increase in Australia's annual average rainfall for the first two decades of this century compared to the years 1900 to 1919. However, experts contacted by Fact Check said this was a flawed means of assessing rainfall patterns and drying trends overall in view of Australia's vast landscape and the high variability in rainfall behaviour. They said the national average disguised regional differences, which were most starkly felt between the north and the south of the continent. On average, northern Australia has become wetter but parts of southern Australia — namely the south-east and south-west — have become much drier in recent decades.   Further, less rain has been falling in the cooler months in the south, a period critical for streamflows, water storage and agriculture. Experts told Fact Check that because Australia is such a large country national averages wouldn’t reflect regional changes. Anna Ukkola, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of NSW, told Fact Check: ""Talking about 'Australian' rainfall is just as useful as talking about European or Asian rainfall."" ""The north/north-west of the country has been getting wetter and drives much of the national increase. But parts of the south-west and south-east have been getting drier, in particular in the cool season …"" ""In south-western Australia, the last two decades have been the driest since records began in 1900."" Australia's rainfall data has been collected and disseminated by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) since 1900. The bureau calculates national rainfall averages as well as averages for each of Australia's eight states and territories, and for specific geographic regions. These regions include the north and south broadly, as well as the eastern, south-eastern and south-western parts of Australia.   In northern Australia, which takes in the northern half of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and most of Queensland, the wet season (the period in which high rainfall is expected) runs during the warmer months of the year — from October through April. The opposite is so for southern Australia, which includes the southern half of Western Australia and southern Queensland, as well as South Australia, NSW, Victoria and Tasmania, where the wet season occurs in the cooler months of April through to October. For the sake of consistency, the bureau tracks rainfall changes by calculating variations to the 1961-1990 average, in keeping with international standards. Considering rainfall patterns for specific regions allows for a clearer view of trends, according to experts. This is because national rainfall data could be skewed by extreme results in different parts of the country. University of Melbourne climate scientist Dr Josephine Brown told Fact Check ""It is more meaningful to consider trends in different regions and different seasons"" when considering rainfall data.  Rainfall across Australia is highly variable, not simply because of the difference in regional wet seasons, but because of different atmospheric and oceanic drivers. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole both have a major impact on Australia's rainfall. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the former is a natural climate cycle with ""a sustained period of warming (El Nino) or cooling (La Nina) in the central and eastern tropical Pacific"". Among other impacts, the El Nino phenomenon leads to reduced rainfall and warmer temperatures in the eastern and northern regions of Australia. The opposite occurs with La Nina, which usually develops in autumn or winter and is accompanied by an increase in rainfall in eastern, central and northern Australia, and cooler maximum temperatures in the southern tropics. Melbourne University's Dr Brown said El Nino and La Nina occurrences and impacts were important to understand because they are responsible for ""a large part of our rainfall variability"". ""It does help to understand the year-to-year variability. And … [during] the 20-year periods that we're talking about there were a number of major El Nino and La Nina events."" Another weather influencer is what's known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which affects a different region of Australia to ENSO, impacting rainfall and temperature patterns over eastern and southern Australia during May to November.   Put simply, ""the Indian Ocean Dipole is the difference in ocean temperatures between the west and east tropical Indian Ocean that can shift moisture towards or away from Australia"". Dr Brown said the El Nino Southern Oscillation was more important for the north and the east of the continent, whereas the IOD affected winter and spring rainfall, in ""a band across southern and eastern Australia"". ""They [ENSO and IOD] have a different spatial pattern in how they affect Australian rainfall.""   Data recorded by the bureau for Australia's annual average rainfall supports Mr Kelly's claim. From 1900 to 1919, Australia's average annual rainfall was 438mm, which is less than the recorded average (494mm) between 2000 and 2019. This is despite 2019 being the driest year on record, when just 277.63mm of rain fell — 40 per cent below the 465.2mm baseline average (1961-1990).   This record-low average actually incorporates above-average rainfall in parts of Queensland's north-west and northern tropics, as well as in parts of Western Australia. Ben Henley, a lecturer working in Monash University's School of Earth Atmosphere and Environment, told Fact Check that a national average for one year of data revealed little. ""2019 was a real outlier, an extraordinarily hot, dry year,"" he said. ""Extremes can be significant and interesting to look at, but with high inter-annual variability, we could very well have the wettest year on record next year. ""There's so much variability in Australia's rainfall. We have to deal with such high variability, and be aware that it can mask underlying trends."" Indeed, the bureau's annual climate statement cautions that ""every period of rainfall deficiency is different"". It goes on to say that ""the extraordinarily low rainfall experienced [in 2019 is] comparable to that seen in the driest periods in Australia's recorded history, including the Federation Drought and the Millennium Drought"". Meanwhile, Australia's highest national rainfall average occurred in 1974 (759.65mm), followed by 2011 (707.73mm).   In 2019, according to the bureau, most of Australia experienced below-average rainfall, with ""much of Australia affected by drought"". However, increased ""tropical activity"" in ""parts of Queensland's north-west and northern tropics"" has skewed the national picture, leading to ""above-average"" rainfall overall. Indeed, while annual average rainfall in northern Australia between 1900 and 2019 was 519mm (just below the baseline average of 524mm), increased recent falls during the wet season have been responsible for much of the national rainfall gains.     In recent decades, rainfall averages across parts of southern Australia have been low. This has been particularly so during the April to October wet season, which is crucial for agriculture across the region. While the long-term trend line suggest annual rainfall has been rising in southern Australia between 1900 and 2019, average rainfall during the wet season was 246.07mm — 4 per cent below the 256.1mm baseline average (1961-90). Dr Brown explained the upward trend in the southern region's annual rainfall over the 120-year period as influenced by rainfall recordings for inland areas ""where there is a weak positive trend"".     The drying trend has been most evident in the south-western and south-eastern corners of Australia where less rain is falling during the cooler months of autumn and winter. Dr Brown told Fact Check the trend was clear in the decades since the 1970s, while Dr Ukkola said projections suggested the regions would receive less rainfall in the coming years, especially during the cool season which was crucial for streamflow generation and, therefore, water resources. ""In south-western Australia, the last two decades have been the driest since records began in 1900,"" Dr Ukkola added. Dr Henley, of Monash University, said: ""We're seeing significant drying trends in the southern Australian cool season, but in the warmer season, when tropical moisture pushes further south, we have seen some increases in rainfall."" However, this was largely unhelpful from a water resources point of view, because the higher evaporation in the summer reduces the amount of water flowing into dams. ""A key concern with such a change in the seasonality of rainfall is the amplified effect it has on the inflows into water supply reservoirs. ""If more of the rainfall falls in summer, more of it gets lost to evaporation. Rainfall in the cool season is quite precious in that respect — a lot more of it is converted into runoff. ""So, you can begin to see why seasonal changes in rainfall are really important for water supply and agriculture. ""In southern Australia we are seeing some declining trends in streamflow which is a real concern.""     Annual rainfall in the east was particularly low in 1902 during the Federation drought, measuring 330.49mm; it was highest in 2010 (1028.39mm). However, as experts have cautioned, looking at a region's annual rainfall average isn't necessarily representative of the broader rainfall trend. This is particularly so in the east, which takes in the north and the south where rainfall patterns are varied. Eastern Australia experiences significant year-to-year rainfall variability due in most part to the impact of ENSO. In the eastern half of the country, El Nino events typically produce decreases in rainfall whereas La Nina events mean wetter periods.   Experts contacted by Fact Check said that although Australia's average annual rainfall had been increasing — with the last two decades among the wettest on record — relying on this measure alone was problematic. Dr Ukkola told Fact Check: ""Talking about 'Australian' rainfall is just as useful as talking about European or Asian rainfall."" ""The north/north-west of the country has been getting wetter and drives much of the national increase. But parts of the south-west and south-east have been getting drier, in particular in the cool season …"" she said. Dr Brown said Mr Kelly's statement did not capture the full story of rainfall and drying trends. ""Australian rainfall is highly variable… so, comparing two 20-year periods may not give reliable information about long-term trends. ""Any average over 20 years is likely to be dominated by the El Nino and La Nina events in that period because they have such a large effect on Australian rainfall.   ""They produce very large anomalies — either wet or dry depending on which phase we're in. ""The other problem is when you're talking about the average rainfall over the entire area of the continent, it isn't very meaningful because the trends are different in the north and in the south. Trends and variability in Australian rainfall are different in different regions."" The north-south divide demonstrated this most starkly. ""Because the total amounts of rainfall are larger in the north, it dominates calculation of average Australian rainfall,"" said Dr Brown. ""But, of course, the majority of the population and agriculture is located in the southern part of the continent."" She added: ""The last two decades have seen strongly declining rainfall in south-east and south-west Australia with 17 of the last 20 southern wet seasons below the long-term average."" Dr Henley said: ""On the ground, it doesn't make too much sense at all to talk about all Australian rainfall."" ""People care about water availability at their specific location, and what's happening directly upstream. ""It's important not just to look at total annual rainfall, but also where and when that rainfall falls. We're seeing changes to what we call the spatio-temporal distribution. ""In other words, where and when rainfall actually falls, which seasons, how heavy the downpour, the duration of time between when rain falls -- there's a lot more to the picture than just total annual rainfall over a very large area."" Matthew England, of the University of NSW Climate Research Centre, said: ""Northern Australia has on average become wetter, and south-east and south-west Australia have become drier.""   Therefore, looking ""Australia-wide, total rainfall amounts are useless and irrelevant to the question of recent drying trends over south-east and south-west Australia, because those drying trends are offset by increased rainfall to the north."" Further, higher rainfall and extreme drought were not necessarily mutually exclusive in a land as vast as Australia, according to Dr Ukkola. ""Higher rainfall can occur with more droughts if rainfall becomes more variable. ""Indeed, Australia's rainfall has become more variable since the early 20th century and climate models project this trend to continue with climate change."" Dr Henley added: ""We're acutely interested in understanding when and where the changes in the hydrological system occur and what's driving them. ""I'm concerned that highlighting particular aspects of the data, without having concern for other aspects, can lead to a broader misunderstanding about the very serious nature of climate change. We have to look at the full picture. ""Climate change is the single biggest challenge ever faced by humanity. We have absolutely no time to lose.""

11,/news/2020-02-27/who-are--scientists-professionals-who-say-no-climate-emergency/11734966,Who are the 75 Australian 'scientists and professionals' who say there is no climate emergency?,"Periodically, petitions containing the signatures of ""scientists"" who are sceptical of human-induced global warming emerge, which seek to counter the views of climate scientists. Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly highlighted one such recent petition on Facebook in October. ""WHY ARE THEY IGNORING 500 SCIENTISTS & PROFESSIONALS?"" Mr Kelly's post began, which reproduced in full a petition known as the European Climate Declaration, declaring there is ""no climate emergency"". Mr Kelly went on to say that Labor ""denied the science and joined the climate crazies declaring a 'climate emergency'"". A letter to the UN Secretary General which accompanied the petition introduced the signatories as ""knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields"".   The list of signatories on the petition includes 75 Australians — the second highest number of any country. So, who is behind the petition and who are the Australian signatories? And how many are scientists?   Since Mr Kelly posted the petition on Facebook, it has been re-released with over 700 signatories, including 109 Australians, and rebadged the ""World Climate Declaration"". Fact Check's investigation focuses on the version presented by Mr Kelly in October, 2019.   The document lists 14 ECD ""ambassadors"" from different locations. A number of them have been active in the climate sceptic community for many years. Australia's representative, Viv Forbes, has been writing sceptical articles for over a decade. He is the administrator of long-running climate sceptic blog Carbon Sense. He is also the executive director of climate sceptic organisation the Saltbush Club, which was constituted in November 2018 to ""change the climate of public opinion, thus changing the political agenda"". A document listing  the ""founding members"" of the Saltbush Club, says of Mr Forbes: ""He has spent his working life in the resource and pastoral industries of northern Australia, for five years as a government field geologist and then in private industry. He has held almost every job from rouseabout and field assistant to Financial Analysis Manager to Chairman of the board, in metals, oil, gas and coal, and focused on feasibility studies, investment analysis, mine development, lecturing and writing. He has been self-employed for about 35 years."" Guus Berkhout, from the Netherlands, is one of the founders of climate sceptic organisation, Clintel, which was founded this year and is the progenitor of the petition. On his website, Mr Berkout lists professional experience as a professor of geophysics at TU Delft, ending in 2016. His biography also details his time working for petroleum company Shell in the 1960s and 1970s. There are a number of notable Australians listed in the petition, including: The petition can be read in full below, including the full list of 75 Australian names.   Fact Check attempted to contact each Australian signatory to the petition to verify that they had signed the petition and endorsed its contents. The majority we were unable to contact. We asked Mr Berkhout to provide contact details for each Australian signatory. He declined, citing privacy reasons. Fact Check also asked Mr Forbes for help in this endeavour; he also declined. In an email, Mr Forbes speculated that ""most of [the signatories] would hang up quickly if you phoned them and explained your purpose as most of them would have zero faith in the ABC to be impartial. They would see it as just another sneaky aspect of the ABC's partisan promotion of climate alarmism"". Nonetheless, Fact Check was able to source contact details for just over a third of the signatories. Through phone interviews and correspondence on the internet, we were able to verify the identities of 29 out of 75. We spoke to 22 via phone, of whom two hung up before completing the full interview. However, we were able to confirm that each of these signatories did indeed sign the petition. A further four corresponded with us via email, and another three via LinkedIn. This leaves 46 we were unable to contact, and therefore, unable to verify. The vast majority of these we were unable to find contact details for. However, some were contacted and did not respond to requests for an interview, including Emeritus Professor Plimer, with whom we left several voicemails. Further investigation online revealed an organisational connection between many of the signatories. The names of 38 of the Australian signatories (50.7 per cent) are listed as founding members of the Saltbush Club in a document found on its website — the same organisation of which ECD representative Viv Forbes is executive director. A further 11 (14.7 per cent) are listed as supporting members in a separate document. That's a total of 49 (65.3 per cent) who have open association with the club. Details of these 49 in the Saltbush documents matched the name and biographical details in the petition. Mr Ellis is listed as the chairman of the organisation, and Mr Morgan and Emeritus Professor Plimer are listed among its five ""founders"".   The organisation advocates withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit a rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. The group counts both former Liberal National Party Queensland premier Campbell Newman and current LNP Queensland state MP Colin Boyce amongst its founding members, as well as former federal Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm and mining magnate Gina Rinehart. None of these people are signatories of the petition. When asked how they heard about the petition, many of the signatories we spoke to were unable to recall. Some said it came from Mr Forbes himself, some said that they heard about it through the Saltbush Club. Others said they were contacted by Mr Berkhout directly. Two signatories Fact Check spoke to over the phone mentioned that they had heard about the petition through the Saltbush Club, despite not being listed as founding or supporting members. The organisation's list of founding members mentions that there is a ""silent list"" of members who do not wish to be identified, and ""an even longer list of people on our mail lists who also prefer anonymity"". Some we spoke to were even unsure of which petition we were referring to at the beginning of the interview. One signatory remarked that he had signed over 30 petitions related to climate change, but lamented that ""politicians don't pay attention to them"". Many of them have scientific backgrounds, but significant numbers work in fields unrelated to climate science. In a letter to the United Nations from Mr Berkhout dated September 23, 2019, the 506 signatories of the petition are introduced as ""knowledgeable and experienced scientists and professionals in climate and related fields"". However, an examination of the declared professions of the signatories on the petition reveals that many of their professional occupations are unrelated to climate change, or even the environment. The Australian contingent includes a barrister and solicitor, a radiologist, a managing director of a winery, a retired aircraft engineer, a security engineer and an ""astro economist"". One of the signatories on the list, P.C. Wilson, is referred to as a former ABC journalist from Queensland. Fact Check was unable to source contact details for a journalist under that name and location. We asked both Mr Berkhout and Mr Forbes to explain how these people in professions unrelated to climate science are qualified to comment on climate science. Neither responded. Through descriptions on the petition, or through further investigations and interviews, we identified that 22 (29.3 per cent) of the signatories claimed a current or former connection to the mining industry, among them Mr Ellis and Mr Morgan. Fact Check contacted Mr Ellis via an email supplied by one of the other signatories to confirm his signature, but received no response. Mr Morgan confirmed over the phone that he signed the document, but terminated the call after further questioning.   Twenty (26.7 per cent) of the signatories said they were geologists or retired geologists of some sort, either on the petition itself, when interviewed by Fact Check, or in information listed on the Saltbush Club website. An analysis of the broader international field of signatories was conducted by agroecologist Amber Kerr, from the Agricultural Sustainability Institute at the University of California, as part of an analysis for International Fact Checking Network code of principles signatory Climate Feedback. Dr Kerr noted that 19 per cent of the of the signatories were described as geologists and 22 per cent were described as engineers — these were the most prevalent groups across the petition. She also highlighted the lack of gender diversity on the list: ""Among the 506 names, only 24 were female names (with another 15 that were initials-only or unisex)."" Of the Australian contingent, there are two female names on the list — Marjorie Curtis and Judy Ryan. Fact Check was only successful in contacting Dr Curtis; Dr Ryan did not respond to an emailed request for an interview. There were also four others who had names which were ambiguous, or only initials, for which we could not verify their gender. That leaves 69 signatories who are men, not counting those who are undetermined — or 92.0 per cent, and only 2.7 per cent confirmed to be women. The question of who can call themselves a scientist is a vexed one. Fact Check contacted the Australian Academy of Science for advice on this matter. The spokesman for the academy responded to our questions with two statements, which are reproduced in full below.   The spokesman told Fact Check that peer-reviewed research was an important indicator: ""A scientist generally refers to any individual who has conducted peer reviewed research in a scientific discipline, has relevant tertiary qualifications and training, applies and understands the scientific process, participates in peer review, and has demonstrated expertise in their area of science."" Fact Check asked the academy whether someone with a science qualification who works in the private sector, such as a mining geologist, whose research is not published but rather used for commercial purposes, would still be considered a scientist. The spokesman replied: ""A mining geologist with relevant tertiary qualifications and training is a scientist. They use the scientific process and they have relevant expertise."" ""However, if their science is not open to the scrutiny of the scientific community at large, it must necessarily be treated with a certain level of scepticism. A scientist talking about unpublished data or proprietary results, in any setting, would be treated with caution.""   Fact Check asked each signatory contacted whether or not they had published peer-reviewed research of any type. Eight respondents replied that they had, with two responding ambiguously. We were only able to find peer-reviewed research attributed to seven of them. A further five of those we were unable to speak with have peer-reviewed research available online, which corresponded with their names and any former or current academic positions, as listed on the petition. Twelve respondents confirmed that they had not published any peer-reviewed research. That leaves a further 47 who are unconfirmed, but for whom we could not find any peer-reviewed research. It should be noted however, that at least one signatory who we spoke with, Matthew J. Fagan, the founder and president of FastCAM Inc, while not having published any peer-reviewed research, holds a number of patents. As the AAS told Fact Check: ""It should be noted that there are avenues for industry scientists to publish results. Patenting an invention, for example, requires a complete disclosure of the technology. A number of the signatories have published research related to climate change, in a peer-reviewed journal named Energy and Environment. Energy and Environment has promoted itself in the past as a publisher of climate sceptic articles. Its editor until 2017 was Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen, who told the Guardian in 2011 that ""I'm not ashamed to say that I deliberately encourage the publication of papers that are sceptical of climate change"". Fact Check was able to confirm that five of the signatories have published peer-reviewed climate papers in the journal. They include: An alternative method for assessing whether someone is qualified to comment on science is whether they hold, or have held, an academic position at a university. From the list, we were able to confirm only 10 signatories who hold or have formerly held positions attached to a university. Seven of these we were able to contact directly. Their positions were related to organic chemistry, geophysics, oceanography, anthropology and archaeology, grain science and geology, among others. One notable signatory among this cohort is Dr Ridd, a geophysicist whose firing from James Cook University in 2018, caused controversy. The university alleged that he breached its code of conduct. Dr Ridd won an unfair dismissal case against JCU in the Federal Circuit Court last year; the university was ordered to pay Dr Ridd $1.2 million, but is appealing the decision.   In her analysis for Climate Feedback, Dr Kerr noted that only 10 of the global signatories on the petition identified as climate scientists and four as meteorologists. Of those on the Australian list we were able to contact, Dr Ridd was the only signatory with a confirmed current or former academic position who Fact Check could verify has published peer-reviewed science related to climate change. To sum up, Fact Check was able to verify that 14 of the Australian signatories either held an academic position or published peer-reviewed research. Nine of them had done both. Eleven either told us they had neither held an academic position or published peer-reviewed research. For the remaining 50, we found no academic position or peer-reviewed research, or were unable to independently verify an academic position or peer-reviewed research. Apart from Climate Feedback, several other fact checking outlets in other countries have published research on the background of the signatories. German fact checkers Correctiv checked an earlier version of the petition, which was released in September. They found that three of the 13 German signatories at the time had direct links to climate sceptic group the European Institute for Climate and Energy. Six others had indirect links to the organisation. They also found some of the biographical information of the German signatories to be misleading, partly false, and false, including unverified professorships.   The only country with more signatories on the petition than Australia is Italy, with 113 on the list. Italy's Pagella Politica found that the European Climate Declaration owes much to its Italian signatories. One recounted to Pagella Politica that its genesis was a petition begun in Italy, before snippets were sent to Mr Berkhout, who had the idea of making it a European petition. Quebecois (French Canadian) fact checkers Decrypteurs noted that many of the signatories worldwide work in the fossil fuel sector. And among the 19 Belgian signatories, fact checkers at Belgian magazine Knack found that six of them had previously published climate sceptic articles on Doorbaak.be, a right-wing nationalist opinion site. Not one of the 19 signatories was found by Knack to be a climate scientist. As previously mentioned, the petition declares that there is no climate emergency — and lays out six broad points, each with an explanation — of opposition to the established consensus on climate change: Fact Check has not explored the veracity of these claims for this article. However, six scientists, enlisted by Climate Feedback reviewed the claims shortly after the petition was released. In the summary of Climate Feedback's review it says: ""The claims contradict or misrepresent the evidence uncovered by geoscientists, failing to provide support for its conclusions downplaying the threat of climate change. The letter claims, for example, that climate models ignore the benefits of increased CO2on plant growth. This is false, as many climate models simulate the response of vegetation to increased CO2— and the climate change it causes.""

12,/news/2020-02-25/rmit-abc-fact-check-police-sniffer-dogs-update/11994782,NSW Government gave 'incorrect' figures on sniffer dog success rates to Parliament,"The NSW Government tabled figures on the success rate of drug detection dogs in Parliament last year that NSW Police now say were ""incorrect"" and produced using ""untested methodology"". When the Legislative Council resumes for 2020 today, Police Minister David Elliott is expected to table amended figures which show the performance of sniffer dogs in a better light.   The new figures show the dogs got it right 31 per cent of the time after indicating a person was carrying drugs in 2018-19. The original statistics, contained in a document signed by Mr Elliott and tabled in the Upper House on his behalf by Education Minister Sarah Mitchell in October, showed drugs were found in just 24 per cent of searches in that year. The Government will table updated figures for the years from 2011-12 to 2018-19, each of which reveals a better success rate for the dogs than originally stated. The new figures show that drugs were found in 33 per cent of all cases over the eight-year period, compared with 24 per cent in the October figures.   The use of drug detection dogs was criticised for leading to so-called ""panic ingestion"" of drugs by the NSW Deputy Coroner Harriet Grahame in her report last year into the the deaths of six young people at music festivals. ""Having reviewed the evidence, I remain extremely concerned about the practice of drug dog operations at music festivals,"" Magistrate Grahame said. Her November 8 report contained a similar figure to the one tabled in Parliament. ""The fact is that in 2018–19 police figures supplied show that in personal searches after drug dog indication, drugs were found in 23.8 per cent of cases"" the report said. Experts have also questioned the success rate of the dogs, including RMIT University lecturer in criminology and justice studies Peta Malins, whose research on drug dogs formed part of Magistrate Grahame's findings. ""[Sniffer dogs] are not at all successful in finding drugs,"" Dr Malins said last year. ""Many people [at music festivals] get past the dogs with drugs, including some who have described just walking right past a dog with drugs in their pocket."" But police have long argued that the dogs' success in detecting drugs justified their use. The conflicting figures came to light after RMIT ABC Fact Check found claims made NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller relating to drug detection dogs to be ""overstated"". Mr Fuller claimed on November 19 that the dogs were successful in almost 40 per cent of cases. In reaching its verdict, Fact Check relied on Mr Elliott's document tabled in Parliament on October 24, which at the time contained the most up-to-date publicly available data.   The new figures were provided to Fact Check in January under freedom-of-information laws, and more closely align with the commissioner's claim. But the discrepancies between the two sets of figures are unexplained, with NSW Police saying only that the October figures were developed using ""untested methodology"" and had not been peer-reviewed. In a statement, a NSW Police spokesman said: ""The figures relied upon by [Fact Check] in the article dated 11 December 2019 were calculated using untested methodology. ""The methodology used was developed differently from that applied on all other occasions to the production of official NSW Police Force statistics, and is unlikely to be progressed for endorsement."" In a letter to the Clerk of the Legislative Council, Mr Elliott said he had been advised in relation to the new data that ""the figures provided are accurate and have been obtained using the current methodology"". On the old data, Mr Elliott said the figures had been ""developed differently from that applied on all other occasions to the production of official NSW Police Force (NSWPF) statistics"". ""NSWPF also advised that the methodology had not been peer reviewed."" Both the police and Mr Elliott have declined to answer further questions as to how the methodologies used to develop the two sets of figures differ. RMIT ABC Fact Check has suspended its verdict on Mr Fuller's claim due to the unsatisfactory explanation. The unit's director, Russell Skelton, said Fact Check no longer had confidence in the police figures. ""We have asked the police for an explanation as to the difference between the two sets of figures and have not received a satisfactory or transparent response,"" he said. ""In light of this, we have decided to suspend the verdict from the fact check. ""When a minister tables figures in Parliament, journalists and the public should have confidence they are accurate. A lack of transparency on how incorrect figures came to be tabled only creates further doubt in those figures and erodes public trust in our institutions.""

13,/news/2020-01-15/is-arson-mostly-to-blame-for-the-bushfire-crisis/11865724,Some Coalition MPs say that arson is mostly to blame for the bushfire crisis. Here are the facts,"As bushfires continue to cut a devastating swath across millions of hectares, debate has turned to focus on the extent to which arson is to blame. Social media has been rife with claims that the majority of the fires have been deliberately lit. A number of prominent politicians and public figures have also suggested that arson, not climate change, is the main cause. In a recent interview, controversial Liberal MP Craig Kelly said climate change had not caused the bushfires — but that unprecedented arson had. ""We know you need some form of ignition,"" he told ABC Radio's RN Breakfast.   ""Now the majority of these fires, we've had unprecedented numbers of people being arrested and charged with arson offences. The arson is not caused by climate change."" In a January 4 interview on ABC News Channel, Tasmania Liberal senator Eric Abetz also referred to ""unprecedented"" levels of arson in relation to the bushfire crisis. And Nationals MP George Christensen said in a Facebook post that the cause of the fires was ""certainly"" man-made, but ""it's just not man-made climate change. It's man-made arson that, to me, almost borders on terrorism"". Meanwhile, West Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, having announced a $70 million donation for bushfire recovery and resilience measures, said while he did not want to politicise the crisis, he believed arsonists played the ""biggest part"" in starting bushfires. Mr Forrest subsequently issued a statement clarifying his position, saying he unequivocally accepted the warming of the planet as a primary cause of the catastrophe. ""I do not want people to think that criminal behaviour, while reprehensible, is the main reason for the devastation this bushfire season,"" he said. ""Arson may be responsible for starting fires in some cases, but it is not the reason the fires have reached the proportions they have through this season and it is not the reason they have continued for so long."" Is arson primarily to blame for the bushfire crisis? RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a look at the evidence.  As noted by the Black Saturday Royal Commission, in a legal sense ""arson"" is an indictable offence that involves deliberate fire-setting resulting in criminal damage to property, including a structure, a house, a vehicle or vegetation. Arson also involves the ""requisite intention"" to cause damage or have no regard for the damage that might result from a fire. Many bushfires, for example, are the result of negligent or illegal behaviour by people ignoring total fire bans or throwing away lit cigarettes and matches. However, this type or behaviour generally does not meet the legal or technical definition of arson.   Assessing the extent to which bushfires are caused by arson is tricky. Various jurisdictions and government agencies have different approaches to defining and recording fires that are deliberately lit. As the Black Saturday Royal Commission report put it: ""Some jurisdictions adopt a broad definition, deeming all suspicious fires to be arson; others might limit the term to those fires for which there is a prima facie, or even a proven, case of arson."" According to experts contacted by RMIT ABC Fact Check, this inconsistency has changed little in the years since that report was handed down. Identifying the cause of a bushfire can be difficult, given fires often start in remote or secluded places.   Melbourne University Associate Professor Janet Stanley, a leading expert from the National Centre for Research in Bushfire and Arson, said about 40 per cent of fires had no assigned cause, and less than 1 per cent of arsonists were caught and convicted. ""I don't think we can know at this point how this current round of fires started,"" Professor Stanley told Fact Check. ""Unless people were there and picking a person up on the spot lighting the fire, arson is very hard to detect because it tends to be committed away from people in a quiet spot in the bush. ""Often the fire itself destroys any evidence, so it's a very hard crime to detect, and getting evidence to prosecute and get a conviction is difficult."" Australian research into the causes of bushfires and the extent to which arson is to blame is relatively scant. A February 2008 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology estimated that, of bushfires with known causes, 13.3 per cent were maliciously lit. A further 36.2 per cent were deemed ""suspicious"". About a third, 35 per cent, were found to be ""accidental"" — started, for example, by children or smokers. ""Difficulties exist in determining how the numbers of deliberate (incendiary and suspicious) fires have changed over time, due to changes in database collection methods, difficulties in integrating databases, the considerable uncertainty in the causes of many fires and complexities in delineating the specific cause of particular temporal variations,"" the report noted. Troy McEwan, an associate professor in clinical and forensic psychology at Swinburne University, said in an interview on ABC's RN Breakfast that arson was responsible for a significant proportion of fires in Australia, although it was not helpful to attribute the majority to arson. Associate Professor McEwan offered the example of the February 2009 Black Saturday fires, which killed 173 people. Initially, four of the fires were thought to have been caused by arson, leading to 52 of the 173 deaths. ""Subsequently, only one of the fires on that day was actually attributed to arson and that caused 10 deaths,"" Associate Professor McEwan said. ""And that's obviously horrific and bad enough but we can't jump to conclusions too quickly. ""I think we need to be open to the idea that it could be caused by arson but, equally, it's not helpful to say these fires are always caused by arson or the majority of them are because the reality is, it seems, that most very large fires are not caused by arson."" In Victoria, the Crime Statistics Agency publishes information on offences in relation to bushfires. The offence is divided into three subcategories: intentionally cause a bushfire; recklessly cause a bushfire; and recklessly spread a fire to vegetation. The latest data is for the year to September 2019, with no official figures covering the current bushfire crisis yet available. Over the 12 months to the end of September 2019, Victoria Police recorded 21 offences involving a person intentionally causing a bushfire. Far from representing an ""unprecedented"" level of bushfire arson, that was the lowest level for at least a decade, and well below the 10-year average of 49.5 offences.   Victoria Police has also contradicted suggestions that the current bushfire crisis has been overwhelmingly caused by arsonists. A Victoria Police spokeswoman said: ""There is currently no intelligence to indicate that the fires in East Gippsland and the north-east have been caused by arson or any other suspicious behaviour."" The Country Fire Authority (CFA) has also reportedly said the recent fires were not caused by arson. The CFA incident controller in Bairnsdale, Brett Mitchell, pointed to lightning as the cause of most of the fires. Likewise, in NSW, emergency services personnel have blamed lightning strikes for most of the fires. ""I can confidently say the majority of the larger fires that we have been dealing with have been a result of fires coming out of remote areas as a result of dry lightning storms,"" NSW Rural Fire Services Inspector Ben Shepherd was quoted as saying. The New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research provided Fact Check with unpublished data on the number of people suspected of bushfire arson facing police action.   These figures show over the year to September 2019, 56 people faced police actions in relation to alleged offences regarding the lighting of a fire, lower than the decade average of 68.7 people. According to a January 6 statement released by NSW Police, since November 2019, legal action ranging from cautions through to criminal charges had been taken against 183 people in relation to bushfires. However, it is wrong to suggest, as some people have done, that this figure relates solely to bushfire arson. The vast bulk of this action related to other offences such as failing to comply with fire bans and the discarding of lit cigarettes and matches. Of the 183 people who face legal action in NSW, only 24 (representing 13 per cent of the total) were charged with deliberately lighting bushfires. A further 53 people (29 per cent of the total) faced charges or a caution for failing to comply with a total fire ban; 47 (26 per cent) faced charges or were cautioned for throwing away a lit cigarette or match on land. Fact Check was unable to access separate data for ""bushfire arson"" (as opposed to ""arson"" more broadly) in Queensland. In a statement, Queensland Police said a taskforce had been established in September 2019 to investigate fires. It suggested about 11 per cent of bushfires reported in Queensland between September 10, 2019 and January 8, 2020 had been found to have been deliberately lit. ""As at January 8, 2020 there have been 1,068 reported bushfires in Queensland since September 10, 2019,"" the statement said. ""Of these, 114 fires have been deliberately or maliciously lit through human involvement and have been subject to police enforcement action."" It said 109 people (including 36 adults and 73 children) had been dealt with by police across Queensland for offences relating to recklessly and/or deliberately setting fires.  Although not always the case, evidence suggests that so-called ""natural fires"" — generally started by lightning strikes — are likely to be much larger and more remote than fires started by arsonists. University of Tasmania Professor of Environmental Change Biology David Bowman, a leading bushfire expert, told Fact Check that many of the big fires in the current crisis were known to have been caused by lightning strikes, having originated in remote areas after lightning storms. ""We know there are lightning storms that have caused these fires,"" Professor Bowman said. ""One of the signatures of arson is that arson [occurs] in proximity to people. Many of these fires have been burning in remote and inaccessible areas, so there is a significant lightning component."" Swinburne University's Professor McEwan told Fact Check that smaller fires on urban fringes were more commonly linked to arson.   ""What we do know is that larger vegetation fires that occur further from urbanised areas are less commonly attributable to deliberate fire-setting than are smaller vegetation fires that occur on the urban-rural fringe,"" she said. This was backed by an Australian Institute of Criminology study, which analysed about 280,000 fire incidents attended by 18 different Australian fire services. It concluded that natural fires tended to be much larger than deliberately lit fires, which typically occur nearer to populated areas and roads, meaning they tend to be contained more rapidly. ""[D]eliberate fires typically comprise a decreasing proportion of all fire causes as fire size increases, whereas natural fires comprise higher proportions of larger fires,"" the report noted. ""Deliberate fires resulting from illegal burn-offs are on average larger than deliberate fires resulting from vehicle arson or other incendiary activities."" There is no doubt that arson is responsible for a significant number of fires in Australia. However, the data does not yet exist to accurately dissect the current bushfire crisis. According to experts consulted by Fact Check, that could take some time. What evidence there is, however, suggests it is highly unlikely arson has been responsible for most of the current bushfires. Nor is there any evidence to indicate bushfire arson has increased to ""unprecedented"" levels, as some in the Morrison Government have suggested. In Victoria, the number of intentionally caused bushfire arson offences peaked in 2016, but had fallen to a level well below the 10-year average according to the most recently available figures. Data provided to Fact Check by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows the number of people facing police action for deliberately lit bushfires was below the 10-year average in 2019, having peaked in 2014. Regardless of how bushfires are started, hotter, drier conditions are exacerbating them, according to bushfire experts. Professor Bowman, of the University of Tasmania, said even if all of the unexplained fires were attributed to arson, it would not explain the current bushfire crisis. ""It can't,"" he said. ""To try to criminalise the crisis as being caused by arson is not rational, and it also underplays the fact that the reason this fire crisis is so dramatic is because it is a climate and drought-driven event of heatwaves and extreme wind. There is a very strong background of climate and weather."" Principal researcher: Josh Gordon, economics and finance editor factcheck@rmit.edu.au  ",RMIT ABC Fact Check,"January 15, 2020"
14,/news/2019-12-20/hazard-reduction-burns-bushfires/11817336,Are hazard reduction burns effective in managing bushfires? The answer is complicated,"During one of the most severe droughts in Australia's recent history, early-season and deadly bushfires have raged for weeks across parts of NSW and Queensland. The effects of climate change are being blamed for having worsened conditions, while some politicians from the fire-ravaged states have criticised government policies and planning, ""green"" laws and a lack of hazard reduction burns. Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce pointed to three major ""issues"" that he said needed to be addressed: access to the fires, central watering points, and a lack of hazard reduction burns. The latter he blamed largely on current conservation laws. Speaking on Sky News, he said: ""One [issue] is a lack of controlled burns — fire reduction burns … that policy needs to be changed so we can get those controlled burns."" Similarly, Queenslander and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson accused the Greens and Labor Party of restricting fire-reduction burns.   ""They've actually shut down the national parks, where you can't actually even clear the fuel on the floor,"" she claimed. ""…They won't allow farmers to actually clean up their own properties."" NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro also pointed the finger at the Greens and said: ""We've got to do better and I know that we don't do enough hazard reduction … because of the ideological position [of] the Greens."" That same day, he widened his attack in Parliament: ""The truth of the matter is we still live with [former Labor premier] Bob Carr's legacy: lock up the forest and let it burn. That is Bob Carr's legacy for this state. This is the truth."" Federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, as recently as last week, referred to the ""bogey man of climate change"" which he said was being used to distract from the failure of the states to manage fire risks. ""The Queensland Government taking powers off farmers, taking their rights off them to be able to manage their own land, put in fire breaks, do cool burns, and that has exposed us to much much higher risk than we should,"" he said. So, how effective are hazard reduction burns and how are they managed? RMIT ABC Fact Check considers the facts. Fire behaviour refers to a variety of factors including the manner in which a fire burns, the speed at which it spreads, the amount of heat it gives off and the extent of vegetation it consumes. The way a fire behaves and its severity is dependent on several elements, but can be narrowed down to three essentials: weather, fuel and topography. The volume of fuel, or ""surface fuel"", in a fire's path — such as shrubbery, bark, dry leaves, twigs and so forth — is often the only component of fire behaviour that can be directly modified by people. The rate at which organic materials burns is directly related to its moisture content; the drier the fuel, the more fiercely it burns and the more intense the fire. The moisture of a particular fuel load depends not only on the type of vegetation, but also the humidity and temperature of its surroundings. Eucalyptus forests and grasslands are typically drier fuels that burn hot and fast, while rain forests and irrigated crops burn slower and can potentially slow the pace of a fire.   In a bid to reduce the intensity of unplanned fires, authorities carry out measures to ""treat"" the fuel and reduce the amount that is available to feed a fire. ""They are treating fuel to change its structure and to typically reduce the amount of fuel or fuel load,"" Ross Bradstock, as senior professor at Wollongong University's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, told Fact Check. This fuel treating process is called hazard reduction. Hazard reduction methods include the intentional burning of surface fuel loads, but other practical and ""mechanical"" methods are also deployed. The latter include activities such as ""thinning"" bushland (by cutting down trees), clearing, slashing or mulching ground litter, ploughing fields, cleaning guttering on houses and other buildings, and through fire-resistant garden design and maintenance. Bushfire management is divided into two categories: firefighting and fire prevention. Planned and purposeful burning of excess ground litter and fuel hazards in a specific area is known by many names — a ""hazard reduction burn"", ""controlled burn"" or ""prescribed burning"" to name a few. These types of burns are widely used in fire prevention and are carried out in winter or generally outside the fire season when conditions are less volatile. They require careful consideration and planning to achieve maximum results and to minimise potential dangers to health and wildlife, and to avoid causing accidental bushfires. Prescribed burns should not be confused with ""back burning"", a fire-fighting tool.   As explained by bushfire expert and University of Tasmania professor David Bowman in The Conversation, back burning is ""a last-resort measure"" to stop a progressing bushfire from spreading to specific areas. ""The difference between fuel-reduction burning and back burning is effectively the same as the difference between elective and emergency surgery,"" Bowman wrote. ""Back burning … works by setting fires from containment lines, such as established fire breaks or hastily contrasted ones made with a bulldozer or cut by hand."" Bushfire management activities in Australia are conducted by state and territory governments and their relevant statutory authorities such as fire emergency services, including professional and volunteer firefighters, as well as by municipal councils and individual property owners. At a federal level, bushfire management is regulated by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). A national policy fact sheet outlines the circumstances where fire prevention activities require federal environmental approval. Activities that are not covered by the national law include those approved or authorised under federal or state/territory laws before July 2000 (when the legislation took effect), as well as continued lawful land uses of the sort that were occurring before July 2000 (such as maintaining access to existing tracks and fire breaks, roadside weed control, and routine controlled burns of the type that occurred in the past). Activities that require ministerial approval, according to the act, are those affecting nationally threatened species and their habitats, as well as Commonwealth land. These include, for example, the construction of substantial new fire breaks, access roads or tracks on a significant scale in habitat for national threatened species; one-off fuel burns in remnant forest that is important habitat for nationally threatened species and had not been subject previously to a burning regime; and, proposed new burning regimes in world heritage sites among others.   Fact Check contacted the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services for information about the legal framework, as well as the processes and procedures, governing prescribed burning in that state. Numerous agencies and government departments are responsible for planning, overseeing and conducting hazard reduction on both state-managed and private land. Queensland fire management groups, including volunteer fire brigades, also participate in the yearly operation Cool Burn — a hazard reduction coordinating effort organised by QFES which generally operates from April 1 to August 31. The goal of Cool Burn is to put in place a plan for hazard reduction and other mitigating activities across the landscape with a focus on protecting the community, and public and privately owned assets, as well as identifying areas at high risk of a fire, such as enclosed townships.   QFES Superintendent James Haig told Fact Check that authorisation under Queensland's Fire and Emergencies Act was necessary to conduct hazard reduction burns on private and state-managed lands. This would take the form of either a notification (in cases such as burning assignments for the sugarcane industry), or as a permit obtained from local fire wardens. ""We have a large number of fire wardens, many of whom are volunteers, so they come from the community and they are aware of the local conditions,"" Mr Haig said. According to QFES records, approximately 28,000 permits a year were issued for controlled fires since 2015. ""In 2019, QFES and its partners completed 229 priority mitigation activities to reduce bushfire risk at high-risk sites,"" it said in a statement sent to Fact Check. ""This includes 108 of 175 planned hazard reduction burns, 83 targeted education activities and 38 fire line upgrades."" However, such activities were ""highly dependent"" on weather conditions, it added, with not all planned 2019 burns able to be completed. ""In some areas, it rapidly became too dry to burn safely,"" the QFES statement continued.   ""In other areas, it was too wet too early on and dried out rapidly, leaving a short window of opportunity to safely conduct mitigation activities."" Mr Haig elaborated: ""The most common reason for a permit not being granted would be because the local conditions were too dry; that it was difficult to conduct safely and with the appropriate outcome."" He added that if moisture levels in the soil were too low, then farmers (especially graziers) often would want to hold onto the grass they had, so there were fewer applications for fire permits. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, which manages primarily native forests and state-owned land, is exempt from obtaining a ""permit to light fire"". It has its own procedures and burn targets, and collaborates with the QFES on initiatives such as operation Cool Burn. ""From 1 January [2019] to date, QPWS conducted 291 planned burns over 1,443,882 hectares — which is the largest area covered in the last six years,"" a statement provided to Fact Check said. ""QPWS's annual target for Protection Zones burns is 90 per cent (14,884 hectares). In 2018-19, QPWS achieved 118 per cent of this target."" In NSW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service works with the NSW Rural Fire Service, Fire and Rescue NSW, Forestry Corporation and Sydney Catchment Authority to carry out hazard reduction burns and other hazard reduction activities such as mowing and building firebreaks. According to the NSW Department of Environment, hazard reduction efforts in NSW have increased under the Enhanced Bushfire Management Program (EBMP), which came into effect in 2011. The statewide program began with a five-year commitment to treat 135,000 hectares of bushland (on average) each year. In 2017, the NSW Government extended the program to 2022. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service operates under the Rural Fires Act 1997 and under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974. Over the last eight years, according to its website, the NPWS carried out hazard reduction burns in NSW parks and reserves covering more than 680,000 hectares — more than double that of the previous five-year period. ""NPWS has undertaken 80 per cent of the total hazard reduction burning effort recorded in NSW, despite managing less than 9 per cent of the state,"" its website states.   The University of Wollongong's Professor Bradstock, who also heads the NSW Bushfire Risk Management Research Hub, told Fact Check: ""In Australia, typically we do a lot of prescribed burning, perhaps more so than many other countries, but we are doing it with the intention of reducing the intensity of subsequent wildfires — unplanned fires — to a level where they are potentially controllable using suppression forces."" The threshold of safe and effective fire suppression is calculated by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter, which Fact Check has looked at previously. Using measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and fuel conditions, combined with a formula to account for the effect of drought, the meter creates the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI). An index of 1 means that a fire will not burn, or will burn so slowly that control presents little difficulty, while anything above 100 is considered a catastrophic rating (""code red"" in Victoria). However, Professor Bradstock noted that the McArthur Meter and the FFDI were developed empirically through observations of small fires burning under mild conditions in the 1960s, and did not necessarily perform well in the extreme fire conditions prevailing in the current NSW bushfires. ""[W]e know that the McArthur FFD models underpredict the rate of spread and intensity under high forest fire danger index conditions; in other words, they don't fully capture all the things that are going on when it's really hot, really windy and the humidity is very low,"" he told Fact Check. Experts emphasised that in extreme and catastrophic fire conditions, the surface fuel available for burning makes next to no difference to the level of a fire's intensity. University of Melbourne associate professor Trent Penman, who studies bushfire behaviour,told Fact Check: ""Prescribed burning effectiveness decreases with [increasing] FFDI; when you exceed an FFDI of about 50, you switch from fuel-dominated to a weather-dominated fire. ""At this point, while fuel has a small effect, it is overwhelmed by the weather."" Professor Bradstock agreed, pointing to the example of Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 that claimed the lives of 173 people. His team studied the aftermath of the fires which were associated with an FFDI of well above 100. They found that even in the areas where fuel had been treated with planned burns less than five years prior, there was no measurable effect on the intensity of the fires.   ""At a level where we would have expected the fire intensity to be reduced to suppressible levels, we essentially found no effect,"" he told Fact Check. ""It's almost like a turbo-charging effect, when you have such incredibly high temperatures and very high winds that you only need a negligible amount of fuel to produce a fire intensity that is not suppressible."" The University of Tasmania's Professor Bowman said that in catastrophic conditions, such as those prevailing in the current Queensland and NSW bushfires, all ""organic matter is going to burn"". ""There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour."" Professor Bowman described embers rushing ahead of the fire front, passing over cleared areas to find available fuel like a ""heat gun blasting sparks at incredibly high speed"". ""It's a wind-driven phenomenon,"" he said. ""[E]ven if you can treat everything at a maximum level, it's still not going to give you the benefit under catastrophic fire weather conditions."" Professor Bradstock likened the effect of prescribed burns on fire intensity to a sliding scale. ""The window of effectiveness essentially narrows down to a point where it essentially disappears,"" he told Fact Check. Experts also explained that some fuel types, particularly wet forest vegetation, were not treatable in the cooler months of the year, when prescribed burns can be safely carried out. ""Some fuel types are simply not dry enough to burn in the time, when it is safe to do so,"" Professor Penman said. ""These include rainforests and wet forests."" He gave the example of a campfire: ""[I]f you put green leaves on it to get it started; they won't work. There's too much moisture there to get the fire started. You can put green leaves on, once the fire is going and they'll burn, but if the fuel is too wet, the fire won't start in the first place."" However, these vegetation types would still burn under catastrophic conditions. As Professor Bradstock explained, parts of the Victorian and NSW landscapes, such as the wet forests or alpine areas, were not treatable under normal conditions. ""It's a waste of time because they are usually too wet to burn. ""Because things are so critically dry at the moment, what typically would never burn, well, now it is burning,"" he said. And Professor Bowman agreed that different fuel types affected fire intensity differently, but in catastrophic conditions, ""the variability and fuel load becomes irrelevant"".   A plethora of scientific papers describe hazard reduction burns as the easiest and most effective tool of bushfire management — more effective than slashing, weeding, herbicide use and so forth. Professor Bradstock told Fact Check this was because of its wide reach and comparatively low cost. ""You can treat [through burning] relatively large areas with costs around $100 a hectare in terms of operational costs; so you might be able to burn out 2000 hectares in a day or two, relatively cheaply,"" he said. ""If you were to go in there and try and mechanically treat that, you wouldn't be able to do it."" Burning has been found to be even more effective in areas adjacent to houses or within a so-called Bushland Urban Interface Zone, also known as the wildland-urban interface, despite the higher cost, which can range from $1000 to $10,000 per hectare. ""[E]ven then, it's still probably cheaper than mechanical work,"" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check. A 2018 research article published by the CSIRO indicated that ""intensifying prescribed burning treatments in public land in the [wild-urban interface] achieves a greater reduction in damages compared with applying the majority of the treatments in rural areas. ""However, prescribed burning in the WUI is significantly more expensive and, despite additional benefits gained from this strategy, in most cases it is not the most economically efficient strategy.""   But research has also found that prescribed burning as a bushfire management tool is not a panacea. A 2015 research paper exploring variations in the effectiveness of prescribed burns in south-eastern Australia found that the inconsistency was due to biogeographical variation in fuel types, climatic influences and fire regimes. ""Prescribed burning solutions that are effective in one particular region may not be effective elsewhere unless there is strong similarity in vegetation types, fire weather, fuel accumulation and ignition rates. ""The most efficient use of prescribed fire is applying it to the immediate proximity of assets, where a resultant reduction in fire intensity can be of immediate benefit in terms of impacts on structures and ease of suppression."" As an example of the futility of some prescribed burns, Dr Penman pointed to the forest around Port Macquarie in northern NSW, which has been widely studied and found to have fuel vegetation that regenerates every three to five years. ""Any burn you undertake in those areas has a longevity of about three to five years,"" he said. ""You have to be burning a huge amount before you are actually reducing the risk at all."" In other areas where fuels accumulated more slowly, planned burns had a greater impact, he added. ""But it's never going to stop wildfires."" Professor Bradstock told Fact Check that scientists and agencies with more advanced and up-to-date modeling capabilities would need to better choose treatment areas with maximum cost effectiveness. ""We are going to have to get smarter about it,"" he told Fact Check. ""We are going to learn a lot from the current fire season. ""I know, anecdotally, there has been major property damage done in NSW in areas that have been recently treated."" Professor Penman told Fact Check that ""chasing the hectares"" in prescribed-burn targets was misguided. Rather, states and statutory authorities were using a combination of hectares treated and risk approach in their bushfire management. ""What you're really trying to achieve is [to] reduce the risk to assets that you have of value in the landscape, so that might be ecological assets like at-risk forest types. It may be around cultural sites, and it might be Indigenous or European sites and then other things like power lines, water supply catchments, and then, of course, around houses,"" he said. ""[N]one of the agencies just invest entirely in prescribed burning or something else. They have a mixture of what they do. ""It should never be a debate about, 'Does one thing do everything for us', because everybody knows that's not the case. It's about getting that balance right, across the different approaches. ""So it's quite a challenging landscape to be working in, and you put that in the context of a changing climate and it becomes even harder."" When invited to expand on his media statements regarding prescribed burns and bushfire preparation, Nationals MP Mr Joyce sent Fact Check a list of grievances which focused on higher burn targets, a lack of dams and the imposition of bushfire permits, and pointed to a number of policies that in his view needed to be amended to allow better bushfire management. These included the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, and land clearing laws (including the Native Vegetation Act 2003, the Local Land Services Act 2013 and the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. Mr Joyce nominated the former, saying ""the annual targets need to be dramatically increased"" to allow for more hazard reduction burns. He also pointed to the fact that Australia's National Parks and areas within state forests did not permit grazing, which ""obviously affects fuel loads"". And he suggested that fire permit requirements (for firebreak provisions and mandatory monitoring throughout a burn), as well as the penalties for non-compliance, were stopping some farmers from conducting these all-important activities. However, the bushfire experts Fact Check spoke to dismissed Mr Joyce's claims, saying they failed to address key issues. They countered that reasonable safeguards ensuring landholders and neighbours were kept safe during prescribed burns were an important component of current fire management practices. ""There is a deliberate misinterpretation of the ecological thresholds and there is still the inherent assumption that a fuel reduction burn will reduce wildfires,"" said Melbourne University's Professor Penman. Professor Bradstock said: ""Prescribed burning is constrained by budgets, resources and weather conditions. Pretty simple really: essentially, what we pay for is what we get.""

15,/news/2019-12-09/analysis-exported-emissions-from-fossil-fuels/11752012,Should Australia's fossil fuel exports be counted in its share of global carbon emissions?,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has long suggested Australia can do little to influence the Earth's changing climate because its emissions make up just 1.3 per cent of the world total. The imputation, by extension, is we're too small to make a difference. Such arguments have been made possible — in part — thanks to the international carbon accounting methodology most commonly used to apportion greenhouse gas emissions to individual countries. Sometimes referred to as territorial-based carbon accounting, this system attributes emissions only to activity that takes place within a country's borders; for example, through the combustion of coal for power generation. This means that emissions are not always fully linked to economic activity or, for that matter, to the country where manufactured products are ultimately consumed. For example, a country might manufacture a car made of steel produced by using imported coking coal, and power derived from imported thermal coal. That car may then be sold back to the exporter of the coal. Under international carbon accounting rules the emissions released to make the car are attributed to the country where it was manufactured.   By extension, the emissions embedded in Australia's vast exports of coal and LNG are not counted in Australia's domestic total under the territorial-based carbon accounting rules. There is, however, a growing recognition — including from some fossil fuel exporters — that emissions should also be tallied according to a company or country's economic activity. That includes accounting for the emissions embedded in fossil fuel exports. For companies, this exercise is sometimes referred to as scope 3 analysis. So when Mr Morrison says Australia is responsible for just 1.3 per cent of the global total, there is a counter argument that is gaining traction: once exports of fossil fuels are included, the total is much greater. Tech entrepreneur and outspoken climate change commentator Mike Cannon-Brookes, for example, recently claimed in a tweet that Australia's share of the global emissions rises to more than 5 per cent once the emissions embedded in fossil fuel exports are included.   RMIT ABC Fact Check put this claim to the test. Australia's exports of coal and LNG have boomed in recent years. According to figures from the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, in 2016 (the latest year for which comparable global emissions data is available), Australia exported 391.2 million tonnes of coal, made up of 201.9 million tonnes of thermal coal (used mainly for power generation) and 189.2 million tonnes of metallurgical coal (used mainly for steel production).   That was more than double the 186.7 million tonnes exported in 2000. Australia's exports of LNG have also boomed, increasing more than five-fold over the past decade.   In 2016, Australia exported 45.0 million tonnes of LNG. The latest figure is now much higher, around 75 million tonnes over the year to June 2019. By our estimate, in 2016 Australia's fossil fuel exports (including coal, LNG, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas) contained approximately 1,160 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This was more than double Australia's domestic emissions of 552 million tonnes. Add the two together and it turns out Australia's emissions made up about 3.6 per cent of the global total.   If you restrict the calculation to the combustion of fossil fuels only, as is common with this type of analysis (leaving out sectors such as agriculture and land-use from the domestic and global totals), Australia's share of global emissions rises to about 4.8 per cent. But the equation should not be this simple — at least not in Fact Check's view. If Australia is to be held accountable for its fossil fuel exports, its fossil fuel imports should likewise not be counted in its domestic total. For consistency, that responsibility should be attributed to the country selling the product. Put another way, if Australia's ""exported"" fossil fuel emissions are to be measured against a global total, ""imported"" emissions should also be taken into account so as to avoid double counting. Remove imported fossil fuel emissions from the equation and Australia's share of world emissions from fossil fuel combustion falls from around 4.8 per cent to about 4.4 per cent. And its share of total global emissions falls from 3.6 per cent to 3.3 per cent. This is somewhat less than the figure claimed by Mr Cannon-Brookes. For this reason, Fact Check concluded Mr Cannon-Brookes overstated the extent to which Australia's domestic emissions, together with its exported emissions, contributed to the global total. A different question is whether a resource-rich country such as Australia should be accountable for emissions embedded in exports, and whether emissions should be attributed to the seller or user of fossil fuels. And whether there is a moral argument that they should. Even if you don't accept that notion, such a stocktake is still useful — not least because it highlights the level of risk faced by a big resource exporter like Australia, should the world intensify its action to curb emissions.",RMIT ABC Fact Check economics and finance editor Josh Gordon,"December 09, 2019"
16,/news/2019-08-08/is-economic-growth-slow-under-the-coalition/11390574,"The Coalition wants you to believe the force is strong in the economy, but is it?","During the federal election campaign, the Liberal Party released an image on Twitter depicting Scott Morrison as Obi-Wan Kenobi along with the phrase, ""The economy is strong with this one"". Aside from irking Star Wars die-hards, the tweet highlighted a key theme of the Morrison's Government's re-election sales pitch: vote for the Coalition and Australia's record-breaking economic expansion will continue.   The boom, now in its 28th year, is not over. But troubling signs are emerging. The Reserve Bank has cut the official interest rate twice (in June and July) to a record low in response to slowing growth. But just how bad things are right now is subject to debate. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg recently told Parliament that ""the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong"", while Labor says the economy is ""floundering"", with economic activity being tamped down by stagnant wages, cost of living pressures and flagging productivity growth. According to Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers: ""Economic growth hasn't been this slow [in the] 10 years since the Global Financial Crisis.""   It's a serious claim. The GFC started in mid-2007 with the onset of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the US, although the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 precipitated a new international phase that dragged much of the world into recession. Australia was one of a tiny handful of countries that weathered the storm, notching positive annual growth throughout. But how is it placed now? Is Dr Chalmers correct? There are, of course, several ways to carve up the National Accounts, the official figures that chart Australia's economic health. As AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver puts it: ""The numbers around the National Accounts present a lot of latitude for people to focus on their particular angle."" The most closely watched measure of economic growth — and, indeed, the measure that the Bureau of Statistics publishes as its headline figure — is the chain volume estimate of Gross Domestic Product. This provides a ""real"" estimate of the volume of goods and services produced across the economy, removing the impact of price movements (inflation). The data is almost always expressed in either ""trend"" terms — using rolling averages to smooth out statistical volatility — or ""seasonally adjusted"" terms — a measure which seeks to iron out predictable seasonal fluctuations. It is also most commonly expressed either in annual terms — comparing a particular quarter with the corresponding quarter of the previous year — or as movements from one quarter to the next. There is no consensus about which is the more useful representation of economic growth (different measures tend to serve different purposes). But if you are trying to get a handle on how the economy is tracking at a particular point in time, it's probably most instructive to use the annual (year on year) seasonally adjusted figures. The quarterly figures tend to be more volatile, while the trend figures represent an average and, as such, are less representative of what is happening now. John Edwards, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute and an adjunct professor with the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy at Curtin University, said the annual, seasonally adjusted figures provided ""the best picture"" of what is happening with growth. ""The trend data, by definition, does not tell you what actually happened in the quarter or the year — it is intended more to guide expectations about the future by essentially averaging data."" Which brings us to the question of how the Australian economy is tracking. The latest figures show it grew 1.81 per cent over the year to the March quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. You have to go back to the September quarter of 2009, when the economy was still being buffeted by the aftershocks of the GFC, to find a lower rate. This is consistent with Dr Chalmers' claim.   This is not, of course, the only way to measure growth. The quarterly figures, which tend to be more volatile, tell a slightly different story. In seasonally adjusted terms, growth actually improved slightly in the March quarter, rising to 0.4 per cent from 0.2 per cent in the December quarter. In fact, there have been a number of quarters since the GFC where quarterly growth has been lower than its current rate. Some commentators have also claimed that Australia is now in a ""per capita recession"", having now notched three consecutive quarters of negative growth in GDP per capita. The concept of a ""per capita recession"" is not widespread. A recession, more broadly, is sometimes defined as a period of at least two quarters of negative economic growth. Nevertheless, in quarterly, seasonally adjusted terms, GDP per capita shrank by 0.13 per cent in the September quarter of 2018, by 0.18 per cent in the December quarter and by 0.03 per cent in the March quarter. And over the year, GDP per capita grew by just 0.11 per cent — its slowest pace since September 2009.   Again, this is consistent with Dr Chalmers' claim. But the debate doesn't end here. Mr Frydenberg says he prefers the bureau's measure of ""real net national disposable income per capita"" over the GDP per capita measure. This, he says, provides a more comprehensive measure of living standards. ""Real net national disposable income is a much more comprehensive indicator of living standards than GDP per capita as it measures the amount of real income available for Australian residents to spend or save,"" he said.   On this measure, Australia appears to be faring better, with real net national disposable income per capita up 1.3 per cent over the year to the end of March. But this followed a period of negative or very low growth between the September quarter of 2012 and the March quarter of 2016. As Dr Oliver pointed out, this measure can be heavily influenced by movements in commodity prices. ""That measure is distorted as well — we get a bit of good luck, the iron ore price goes up, and it looks like we are going fantastically well, but most people don't get paid in iron ore, they get paid [a] salary,"" he said. There are several ways to carve up the data. And, clearly, the economic situation confronting Australia today is not as serious as it was during the GFC. At least, not yet. On balance, however, RMIT ABC Fact Check found Dr Chalmers had made a fair call in claiming that economic growth was at its lowest since the GFC. The economy may still be growing, but whether it is ""strong"" is open to question. Moreover, the outlook remains uncertain, particularly in view of the recent stock market turmoil triggered by escalating tensions between the US and China. As the Jedi master Yoda put it: ""Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.""
