Never fear. There's a circuit-breaker on the way tonight and all have you have to do is look up. A supermoon tipped to be the biggest this year will grace southern hemisphere skies. It has already made an appearance in the northern hemisphere, where it was reported to be the largest supermoon of the year. A supermoon occurs when a full moon is especially close to the Earth, making it look up to 10 per cent bigger and brighter than normal. This one will be a mere 356,907 kilometres away. These moons have many types: super blue blood moon and super blood wolf moon are just two. Tonight's is called a pink supermoon. In northern climes, the April supermoon is so named because it often arrives at the same time as early spring pink phlox flowers. The best time to see it will be 11:00pm AEST. If you want to get ahead of the game, use a phone app to work out where it will be rising. You might have seen those seemingly massive moons rising early in the evening throughout March. They are an illusion and are just being tricky. The moon this time of year might look closer earlier in the evening, but the tip is to set the alarm for a bit later. By 11:00pm, it will be higher in the sky.   People in the northern hemisphere have reported the lack of pollution in some centres — where industry has been reduced or entirely shut down by coronavirus restrictions — has given them the best supermoon view for some time. Here, where pollution is not the main enemy, fingers will be crossed for a cloud-free night.  Sydney is not looking great and cloudy conditions are forecast in Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra as well. Darwin will have a bit of cloud around but Perth and Adelaide look to be clear. The best Tasmanian locations will be in the south. If you want to snap a photo at home, there are some things to remember: Don't expect wonders from your smartphone.  While their cameras are getting better and better, they can still distort the image and make the Moon look quite small. You could try zooming in (although digital zoom will reduce the quality) or attaching your phone to a telescope. A tripod or a solid surface like a windowsill can help get a sharp picture, and turning off lights nearby can also help.

The fossil was picked up on a Portland beach in 1998 and donated to the Melbourne Museum but has only recently been closely studied by a team from Monash University and Museums Victoria. Researcher James Rule, who examines the evolution of seals, said the extinction of the 'true' or earless seals could shed light on how sea level rises associated with current climate change will affect the seals that now inhabit our coastline. The use of the word 'true' to describe the type of seal the tooth came from stems from the two categories that broadly define different seal species. Earless, or true seals, lack visible ear flaps and have smaller flippers, meaning it's harder for them to move around on land.   Eared seals, the category Australian fur seals and sea lions belong to, have visible ears and larger flippers that enable them to get around much more easily. ""These true seals don't exist on Australia's coast today,"" Mr Rule said. ""However, in the past, they were the only seals that were here. ""This discovery essentially tells us that at some point in the past when the climate changed the seals went extinct. ""After they went extinct the fur seals and the sea lions colonised Australia and New Zealand from the North Pacific.""   The only other fossil showing the seals lived along the coastline millions of years ago was found at Beaumaris, in Melbourne, and has been dated at six million years old. Mr Rule said higher sea levels associated with a warmer period in the Earth's history would have presented an ideal habitat for the true seals. He said the climate began cooling roughly two-and-a-half million years ago, meaning more ice formed at the poles and the sea level fell. ""When the sea level dropped it essentially eliminated the shallow coastal environment this seal would have relied upon to live,"" Mr Rule said. ""It would have exposed a lot of islands and rocky beaches along the coast, and this sort of environment is perfect for fur seals and sea lions.""   ""Fur seals and sea lions can actually still sort of walk when they're on the beach and on rocks because they can bring their hind flippers forward to help them. ""Unfortunately … true seals can only bounce and when they don't have a flat beach environment to bounce upon, they can't get up there to rest."" Mr Rule said the research into the ancient seals' fate illustrated the way climate change could affect seal populations, and current rising sea levels may threaten sea lion and fur seal colonies in Australia. ""If the Earth continues to warm and the temperatures increase, we will continue to lose ice at the poles like we are today,"" he said.

As the country enters its fourth week of heavy physical-distancing measures — resulting in a gradual flattening of the curve — health experts have begun contemplating the ""next phase"" of Australia's response, beyond the restrictions.  However, according to the experts — including a group of epidemiologists advising the Federal Government — more data on the rate of community transmission is needed before further decisions can be made. University of Melbourne health epidemiologist Kathryn Snow told the ABC that data would help answer the pragmatic questions such as what could we expect in the next few months.    ""[It will tell us] what restrictions can we relax, as well as what measures are needed in specific locations,"" Professor Snow said.  ""What we will be getting with this new modelling is much more targeted forecasts. It will give us much more specific insight into what's happening in Australia."" Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said on Tuesday the current data on infection rates was being skewed by infected international travellers, but in the ""next week or 10 days"" they would have a ""much better picture"".    Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that data would ""help us plan the way out"" and he committed to releasing the data and subsequent modelling to the public. Speaking on Wednesday, Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia was mapping its path out of the pandemic.   ""We are working to wipe out community transmission and, as we get on top of that, with medical advice, we will begin to take the steps on the road out,"" he said. ""It is likely to be in steps and stages that we can test and reverse.   But he said it was ""highly unlikely"" restrictions such as social distancing or border control would be relaxed any time soon. ""We need to be patient and that will give us the chance to take steps on the way out earlier,"" he said. Mr Hunt said the more successful Australia was in stamping out community transmission, the earlier we could move towards lifting restrictions.   Part of the way to speed up the move to the ""next phase"" of Australia's response, according to experts, is to increase testing.  Speaking on ABC's Radio National, GP and former federal MP Kerryn Phelps said ""if you don't look, you don't find"". ""We need to know where the cases are,"" Dr Phelps said. ""To do that, we need to test."" ""Then we can find individual areas and identify clusters to get data and help stop the spread.""  Testing has been ramped up across Australia to pick up more community transmission of the virus. In NSW, pop-up clinics have been set up in hotspots such as Bondi.    In Queensland, anyone with respiratory symptoms in sites including Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast can be tested. Victorian authorities are offering testing to anyone who is over the age of 65 and has symptoms, as well as people in industries such as childcare, schools, and frontline workers even if they have not travelled overseas.    Dr Phelps said in time authorities would know whether particular strategies were working, in order to determine the ""next phase"".   However she rejected the notion of herd immunity or that people needed to get sick for Australia to find a way out.

Ethical approval to carry out a clinical trial of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine was granted to the ADF's Malaria and Infectious Diseases Institute on Wednesday last week. It will test whether chloroquine is effective in stopping people from contracting coronavirus. An email sent by ADF surgeon general Sarah Sharkey and obtained by the ABC's PM program said the trial would involve military personnel and frontline civilian healthcare workers who volunteered to take part. ""Well controlled trials are urgently needed given the profound global impacts of this disease,"" the email states. Major Stuart McCarthy, who was given the anti-malarial drug tafenoquine during a different trial conducted in the early 2000s, said he had serious concerns about the COVID-19 research.   ""One of my primary concerns with these proposed trials is that there will be a degree of coercion placed on exactly the people who will be at the front line of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Major McCarthy said. He said participants in past trials were pressured into taking part and felt unable to report side effects.   ""That then has a flow-on effect when those reports are published, that then distorts the safety of those drugs as they enter the civilian market,"" he said International guidelines for good clinical practice identify members of the armed forces as vulnerable subjects for medical research because they may feel an expectation to participate.   Steven Scally, a former Australian Army medical officer and practising GP with an interest in veteran health, said the ADF had a ""poor track record"" of conducting medical research. ""I wouldn't even be confident seeing them conduct trials on Panadol to be quite honest,"" Dr Scally said. ""We are nowhere near getting to the bottom of what's happened with trials that were conducted many years ago, so I just don't think the Australian Defence Force has an established reputation at all for conducting any sort of medical research at all."" In 2018, a Senate inquiry handed down its report into the mefloquine and tafenoquine trials conducted by the ADF in the late 1990s and early 2000s.   Veterans involved in the trials told the inquiry they continued to experience long-term side effects linked to the anti-malaria drugs, including psychosis, anxiety, depression and memory loss. ""Many of those individuals continue to beg to charity for medical care, some of them are homeless and sadly many of them have suicided,"" Major McCarthy said.   The Department responded to the inquiry by announcing a $2.1 million to provide comprehensive health assessments for those involved in the trials over four years.  It also agreed to the recommendation that the Defence and Veterans' Affairs Human Research Ethics Committee change its terms of reference to consider that research participants may be vulnerable to perceived coercion to participate in trials. The same committee approved the COVID-19 trial on Wednesday. An ADF spokesperson said it was part of the whole-of-Government response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the trial would be subject to rules provided by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, including obtaining informed consent.   But Dr Scally said he did not believe that was possible. ""Consent and volunteerism is a redundant concept in the military,"" he said. ""Pretty much at the time of enlistment, upon taking the oath, you exchange free will for obedience and that is a culture that really has to exist for the purpose of carrying out your role as a soldier or a sailor or an airman to defend the country."" He said serving members of the defence force should not be subjected to further potential harm by participating in medical research. ""I don't think it's the role of the ADF to offer up its personnel and human resources to be used as guinea pigs for a drug trial,"" he said. The ADF did not responded to a series of questions from the ABC about suggestions of ongoing health issues in time for publication. In the email obtained by the ABC, the ADF surgeon general said the safety profile of chloroquine as an anti-malaria drug was well understood from its use in over a billion people. She said despite the similar sounding name, it did not share the same adverse events as mefloquine. Others have also spoken in favour of the COVID-19 trial, saying medical research into coronavirus prevention is urgently needed. The CSIRO's health and biosecurity health director Rob Grenfell said he was confident the study would be well designed. ""Australia has very tight and stringent and some of the highest order of trial-conducted studies,"" Dr Grenfell said.   The University of Sydney's head of pharmacy Andrew McLachlan said chloroquine trails were still in the very early stages. ""It is a medicine we have a lot of experience with over really decades of treatment, but like any medicine it does carry some risks, particularly at higher doses,"" he said. ""Finding the right dose will be absolutely critical, and that's why trials at the moment will be starting with the recommended current doses but potentially exploring a range of doses to see how effective this treatment might be.""   He said testing the drug on people at higher risk from exposure to COVID-19 such as the health workforce would ""make sense"".

8,/news/2020-04-06/donald-trump-us-stockpiling-anti-malarial-for-coronavirus-fight/12124514,Donald Trump says US stockpiling anti-malarial drug for potential coronavirus use,"The US is stockpiling massive doses of an anti-malarial drug hoped to be used to treat coronavirus despite its efficacy remaining unproven.   US President Donald Trump said Washington had bought ""a tremendous amount"" of hydroxychloroquine, saying there were ""very strong signs"" it could treat coronavirus.  At a media conference on Sunday, Mr Trump said the US was ""very far down the line"" on developing vaccines for COVID-19, adding ""we'll see what happens"". But he said the US had stockpiled 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment.    ""It's a powerful drug on malaria and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs,"" he said. ""I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something. ""We don't have time, we don't have two hours because people are dying.   ""If it does help great. If it doesn't help, we gave it a shot. What really do we have to lose?""   Mr Trump has previously hailed a French study suggesting hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, a common antibiotic, might be an effective treatment for COVID-19.  But he told reporters he was not promoting hydroxychloroquine, saying: ""It may work, it may not.""  He said it would be a shame ""if we didn't turn to these drugs early, if it turns out they are helpful"".   Last month, the World Health Organisation announced a mass global trial of four promising treatments, including hydroxychloroquine. But there have been warnings that there is still much work to be done testing potential cures. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House coronavirus task force, has reminded people that there is only ""anecdotal"" evidence of hydroxychloroquine being effective against coronavirus. The drug has major potential side effects, especially for the heart, and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating COVID-19. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and a cough that clear up in two to three weeks.    For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the pandemic. At the weekend, there were warnings the US faced a critical week in the coronavirus pandemic, with the US surgeon-general Jerome Adams telling Americans to brace for a Pearl Harbour or 9/11 moment. But during the latest press briefing, the Mr Trump expressed hope the country was seeing a ""levelling off"" in some of the nation's coronavirus hotspots, saying Americans were starting to see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"". New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.

9,/news/2020-04-06/donald-trump-us-stockpiling-anti-malarial-for-coronavirus-fight/12124514,Donald Trump says US stockpiling anti-malarial drug for potential coronavirus use,"The US is stockpiling massive doses of an anti-malarial drug hoped to be used to treat coronavirus despite its efficacy remaining unproven.   US President Donald Trump said Washington had bought ""a tremendous amount"" of hydroxychloroquine, saying there were ""very strong signs"" it could treat coronavirus.  At a media conference on Sunday, Mr Trump said the US was ""very far down the line"" on developing vaccines for COVID-19, adding ""we'll see what happens"". But he said the US had stockpiled 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment.    ""It's a powerful drug on malaria and there are signs that it works on this, some very strong signs,"" he said. ""I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something. ""We don't have time, we don't have two hours because people are dying.   ""If it does help great. If it doesn't help, we gave it a shot. What really do we have to lose?""   Mr Trump has previously hailed a French study suggesting hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, a common antibiotic, might be an effective treatment for COVID-19.  But he told reporters he was not promoting hydroxychloroquine, saying: ""It may work, it may not.""  He said it would be a shame ""if we didn't turn to these drugs early, if it turns out they are helpful"".   Last month, the World Health Organisation announced a mass global trial of four promising treatments, including hydroxychloroquine. But there have been warnings that there is still much work to be done testing potential cures. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House coronavirus task force, has reminded people that there is only ""anecdotal"" evidence of hydroxychloroquine being effective against coronavirus. The drug has major potential side effects, especially for the heart, and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating COVID-19. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and a cough that clear up in two to three weeks.    For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the pandemic. At the weekend, there were warnings the US faced a critical week in the coronavirus pandemic, with the US surgeon-general Jerome Adams telling Americans to brace for a Pearl Harbour or 9/11 moment. But during the latest press briefing, the Mr Trump expressed hope the country was seeing a ""levelling off"" in some of the nation's coronavirus hotspots, saying Americans were starting to see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"". New York, the hardest-hit state, reported on Sunday that for the first time in a week, deaths had fallen slightly from the day before, but there were still nearly 600 new fatalities and more than 7,300 new cases.

10,/news/2020-04-06/doctors-designing-medical-equipment-to-face-coronavirus-covid-19/12120588,Australian doctors design and make life-saving equipment needed for coronavirus pandemic,"Australian doctors who are worried the system will not be able to provide them with the equipment they need to protect themselves and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are looking at ways to design and produce their own. Doctors are concerned about the availability of equipment to protect both themselves and patients, one Melbourne anaesthetist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the ABC. ""Many doctors and health professionals are very concerned and confused about the requirements for, and current supply of, personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospitals,"" she said. ""Some hospitals now have less than one week of available stock of this type of equipment to deal with any potential or known COVID-positive patients.  ""This situation is applicable to normal or emergency surgery, emergency rooms and inpatient ward care, as well as the treatment of COVID-positive patients."" A large centralised group involving Victorian university staff, clinicians and manufacturers has been working tirelessly to develop suitable products and to co-ordinate the supply and demand of these essential items, and it has begun to network with other similar groups across Australia and internationally.   They have reached out to philanthropical organisations and local engineers and manufacturers to open up supply lines and found them keen to help.  The PPE items they are working to create in order to reduce the risk to staff and secure their safety include: On top of the doctors' efforts, a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) task force has been established to assess this dynamic supply and demand situation, while the Federal Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has set up a ventilator task force.   All DHHS-supplied equipment needs to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA has created a rapid approval process to speed this up for COVID-related equipment.    Con Kolivas, a retired anaesthetist and software engineer who is helping to coordinate one of the groups, said it started as a casual chat between a few people about the lack of ventilators in Italy at the time. They wondered whether it would be possible for Australia to build some kind of simple ventilator in case of a shortage locally. ""The rate of infection of medical staff in the worst-affected areas overseas is now very high and, to make matters worse, doctors who've been infected at the front line appear to have a higher death rate than people who've caught it in the community,"" he said. ""I and others approached people from different disciplines in industry, medicine, engineering, software and so on about what we could do and found a cohort of people willing to help out. ""After the initial discussion about ventilators, talks turned to things we could manufacture locally and personal protective equipment (PPE) was top of the list. ""This is an infection that we've never faced before so we need novel approaches to things. ""Government and health suppliers don't actually give us any of this sort of equipment, so we needed to innovate because there isn't an easy path to find these novel pieces of equipment.""   Emergency physician and intensive care fellow Arun Ilancheran said a severe shortage of equipment was looming. ""The whole world is trying to acquire the same resources at the same time and we are falling into the toilet roll trap,"" Dr Ilancheran said. ""Our group feels is it imperative that we source local engineers and manufacturers to continue to have the supply chain of the essential equipment that we need to save lives during this pandemic.  ""We are aware that as the lockdown phase gets stricter, we will have further supply chain issues.""   Dr Kolivas said the Victorian Government was keen to support any firm designs the group could come up with, but for any complex designs, the regular government channels of approval and funding could slow things down.  Fortunately, various philanthropical organisations were also very willing to assist, he said. ""With the help of 3D printing it makes it possible to tackle any kind of design we want,"" Dr Kolivas said. ""The problem with 3D printing is it's slow, so it's great for producing the prototypes, but you can't mass produce them if each one takes two hours to print.""   That is where support from local manufacturers comes in.  Dr Kolivas said that, again, there was a desire to help.  Toyota is one example of a company which has offered its design and engineering capabilities to produce equipment on a large scale. Crucially, Dr Kolivas said, ventilator manufacturer Medtronic had opened up one of its designs for free use during the pandemic, without intellectual property restrictions, meaning there was potential for manufacturers to produce the vital piece of equipment in Australia. A website, COVID SOS, has been set up as a central hub for the various groups out there working on novel solutions.  It is also trying to address frontline medical equipment shortages through community-sourced methods of design and manufacture. Here are some examples of the equipment the group is working on:   Dr Kolivas: ""The ""intubation box"" is an example of an alternative novel PPE to deal with the unique threat of coronavirus.  When a patient is so severely affected by the respiratory complications that they need to be put on a ventilator, they need to have a tube put into their trachea to connect them up to the ventilator.  That particular procedure puts the doctor (usually an anaesthetist, intensive care specialist, or emergency physician) and assisting staff in very close proximity with the patient's respiratory tract — they're literally staring down the patient's throat.  The potential for aerosol exposure there is extreme, and our clinicians had seen perspex shells used overseas for that scenario to limit that exposure.  We developed our own solution, as you can see in the diagram, where the patient is under perspex with rubber-like seals to drop around the patient, and it has self-sealing hand holes for the clinicians to do their intubation.  The design was revised and simplified a few times and is made from laser-cut perspex, so is ultimately not that complex to build, which is important. It has been tested clinically with success already and we're looking to produce a number of these for multiple hospitals.""     Dr Kolivas: ""The facial shield is a very simple guard to/from the staff member which provides an impermeable barrier to any aerosols being sprayed in either direction.  It obviously doesn't provide a perfect airtight seal but it affords a great deal of confidence when performing procedures on infected patients.  We were able to prototype these from an open-source design on the internet and 3D print them.  3D printing has allowed us to rapidly get a design built, so it allows for rapid prototyping, but is very slow in production.  A local manufacturer has taken up the need for facial shield designs and has said they'll be able to produce them in the thousands.  We have been connecting hospital networks with this manufacturer to allow them to test out their prototypes and they should be able to order them immediately.""    Dr Kolivas: ""The ventilator splitter is a simple three-way hard piece of tubing. With the potential for running out of ventilators being very real, the splitter gives us a means to use one ventilator on multiple patients instead of the one person which it's normally designed for.  It's a use that ventilators were never approved for, and we have not used them in that manner locally, nor do they work ideally in such circumstances.  However, it effectively doubles the capacity of ventilators we have should we run out due to the demand, and allows us to keep using sophisticated ventilators to manage patients, instead of trying to use a much simpler and riskier ""bag squeezing"" design that would be more in keeping with third-world life-saving emergencies.""    Dr Kolivas: ""The oxygen hoods we've been looking at are a tent that sits over a person's head that allows us to use higher oxygen concentrations in a closed system than the usual ""oxygen masks"" that are used in abundance in hospitals.  Regular oxygen masks vent all their excess gas back into the room and have practical upper limits to the inspired oxygen concentration they provide.  The higher the oxygen concentration we are able to administer, the less likely a patient is to require to be intubated and ventilated.  A commercial manufacturer of these has given permission for local manufacturers to build these without intellectual property issues.""  ",By Dan Colasimone,"April 06, 2020"

12,/news/2020-04-05/start-up-company-makes-3d-face-shields-for-coronavirus-treatment/12121978,Solving COVID-19 supply challenges with 3D printed face shields,"A team of engineers on the South Coast of New South Wales has answered a call to make more equipment for medical staff dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, using 3D printers.   In an empty lecture theatre at the University of Wollongong campus, a local start-up company has set up a 3D print farm.   Forty machines, soon to be 140, are making face shields for frontline workers as part of the battle to slow the spread of coronavirus. Me3D co-founder and engineer Matthew Connelly said the operation would ramp up quickly. ""At the moment we're making hundreds a day, next week 500, and then 2,000 a day,"" he said. His company usually created and designed 3D printers for schools, but has swung into gear during the downturn after being asked to help. ""With the schools being shut down we've had quite a lot of stock left over, so one of the things we are doing with it is taking it out of storage and manufacturing some critical PPE [personal protective equipment] for our nurses and doctors,"" Mr Connelly said.       The call for help came from surgeons who are leading the Illawarra's coronavirus response. Bruce Ashford is the Coordinator of the COVID Task Group at Wollongong Hospital and said because of existing networks and connections he knew he could call on the local IT experts for help. ""We floated the idea past the team at the University of Wollongong and TRICEP (Translational Research Initiative for Cell Engineering and Printing) and sure enough they were able to help,"" Dr Ashford said. ""And we recognised pretty early on in the preparation phase for COVID-19 within the health service that face shields were a pretty critical part of PPE that was not going to be easily accessed for us.""   TRICEP director Professor Gordon Wallace said, because of the network around the university, they were able to start work quickly on a state-of-the-art design to meet health standards. ""We have been working closely with the area health service to define exactly what is needed,"" he said. ""We have gone through a few iterations on the face shield to ensure that it can be used in practical situations. ""We worked to get the design right for manufacturability, comfort, and effective use in the health service and now we are ramping up production. ""At the same time, we needed to think about how we could make it in the shortest time period and use the least amount of material as possible, and that has allowed us to make the prototypes we are handing over."" The engineers are printing the band for the top of the shield and finishing the assembly with a piece of plastic used for projector slides.   To meet the health service order, Mr Connelly said they were pushing their printers to the limit. ""Normally we are looking for a lot of detail and in this case we are looking to get it out as fast as we can,"" he said. The first 40 prototypes are being trialled by teams in Wollongong Hospital's Emergency Department, Intensive Care Unit, and the intubation team in anaesthesia.     Dr Ashford said if PPE was not used correctly and resources were not in good supply people would get exposed to coronavirus. ""If we have one health care worker in Wollongong that is infected due to a lapse in PPE that will be a real disaster,"" he said. Co-founder Me3D and engineer Fletcher Thompson said it meant a lot for the teams involved to feel like they were contributing to the response. ""My sister is a final-year med student, I've got friends who are doctors on the frontline, and every day I see them putting in their best efforts facing the worst conditions they can face,"" he said.   Mr Thompson said their next project would focus on components for ventilators. ""Simple T-pieces we can possibly print up, but it is pending approval from health authorities or the hospitals themselves. We want everything we do to be useful to clinicians,"" he said. ""Anything out of the patient's airway we can contribute … positive expiratory pressure valves, which are not super common, but have been used quite frequently worldwide to try and improve patient outcomes once they've gotten onto a respirator.""   Dr Ashford said the worldwide supply of ventilators and parts was incredibly constrained and there would be things not thought of yet that they would need, but may not be able to obtain. ""We are working hard to keep in front of the wave, but there are things we won't be able to get, or the supply evaporates,"" he said.

14,/news/2020-04-05/coronavirus-child-care-jobkeeper-symptoms-rules-restrictions/12120648,Who's eligible for free child care? Is it safe to shop? The answers to some of this week's key questions about coronavirus,"Every day, as we find out more about coronavirus, it raises more and more questions. How will it change our everyday lives? How long for? How much danger are we in? Here are the answers to some of the key questions you have been asking about coronavirus this week.   The short answer to this question is that there are a lot of rules and advice in place right now.  To make it trickier, this advice varies between all the states and territories, and there are some really hefty fines if you do the wrong thing.   No matter who you are or which state you live in, you should only be leaving the house if it's for an essential purpose.  These include:  Want to know more, like whether you can go fishing, golfing, for a drive, or to see your grandparents?  We've got more info on that here.     A trip to a supermarket to buy food is, for most people, unavoidable. It's been tough buying groceries lately, with widespread panic buying stripping shelves around the country of essentials. But what about the chance of actually catching coronavirus? One of the biggest risks when you go shopping is that you could touch a surface which is contaminated with coronavirus. Experts recommend avoiding touching your face, and washing your hands as regularly as possible. CSIRO microbiologist Cathy Moir says the risk of exposure to coronavirus from fresh fruit and vegetables is low. But fruit and veggies should all be washed before you eat them.  Read more from the experts about safe supermarket trips.   With coronavirus everywhere you look, it can be easy to start to worry when you feel a sore throat coming on.  One of the confusing things about this coronavirus is that its symptoms can be similar to what you would expect from other conditions, like cold or flu. Some people have relatively few symptoms if any, or display no symptoms when they first contract the virus, while others suddenly lose their sense of smell (this could also be a sign of a cold or bad allergies though). The odds of you having COVID-19 are still much lower than getting the common cold or flu. If you're concerned about your symptoms, here's what you should do. You can find the latest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia here. Data from the University of Sydney shows our social distancing measures are beginning to work, and Australia should be close to the peak of new infections under the current measures. But we can't get complacent — projections show scaling back our isolation regime would cause case numbers to spike dramatically. The Government is estimating almost half of the Australian workforce will get this payment over the next six months. That's a whopping 6 million people in the companies hardest hit by shutdowns and the economic downturn sparked by coronavirus. JobKeeper isn't a payment directly to employees, it's actually for employers, which then pass the money on to employees. The employer will deal with the Government, fill in the paperwork and receive the wage subsidies that keep workers on the books. Employees who are kept on the books (even if the business goes into hibernation for a while) will keep receiving their pay in their bank accounts. Still got questions? We've got more info.   Private health cover is a big expense for singles, couples and families, but can be a lifesaver if you need an operation. Now that a large amount of medical procedures have been cancelled while hospitals deal with the coronavirus pandemic, is there any value in paying for it?  There's a lot to consider when making this decision. Some health insurers are offering options for policyholders who no longer have access to services they would usually expect to claim as part of their extras cover. Consumer advocacy group Choice wants the Federal Government to suspend its loading on future premiums, for anyone who drops their health cover due to the crisis. Want to know more to help decide what's right for you? Dig deeper here.   It's a big question to answer — but your real estate agent shouldn't be answering it for you.  The Australian Tax Office is bringing in new rules which will let people affected by COVID-19 get hold of some of their superannuation early. ABC Radio's AM program found some people who had lost their jobs had been getting letters from their real estate agents urging them to consider using their superannuation to pay the rent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has since written to real estate institutes in each state, warning agents they could face hefty fines and imprisonment for unlicensed financial advice against people's best interests. Real estate agents who advise tenants to access their super could face a maximum of five years' imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to $126,000. Agencies could face fines of up to $1.26 million. Here's the full story.   Different countries around the world are having very different experiences. In Spain, which has one of the world's highest death tolls, a makeshift hospital in a conference centre treated over 1,000 patients in one day this week.  Police arrested a woman in a food market in a Chilean city who health authorities said had checked herself out of the hospital where she was being treated. In the US, staff at a New York City hospital have been seen disposing of their gowns, caps and other protective wear in a rubbish bin after wheeling bodies out of the hospital and loading them into a refrigerated truck. Read more about how they're managing the crisis.   This week, PM Scott Morrison announced that child care will be free for parents who still need it. Education Minister Dan Tehan clarified that parents who are currently sending their kids to child care will be able to do so without paying fees. Depending on availability, the deal announced on Thursday covers parents still working during the pandemic, parents working from home, parents who are looking for work and parents who are studying. As part of the deal, childcare centres which receive the payments must try to re-enrol children who have recently been taken out of child care. To help with that, Mr Tehan said the Government would waive the gap fee for returning parents, backdated to March 23. Here's more from Scott Morrison and the Education Minister.   A moratorium is a temporary hold on something. Often that's a legal obligation, like following a contract and paying your rent. The PM first said this about commercial tenancies:  ""States and territories will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of persons as a result of financial distress if they are unable to meet their commitments. And so there will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements."" Later in the week he said the Government and stakeholders were still working towards a mandatory code of practice regarding negotiations and discussions between landlords and tenants.  He also clarified some details for residential renters: ""On residential tenancies, you will recall there was a moratorium on evictions. That doesn't mean there is a moratorium on rents."" There's more information expected on all of this early next week.   This question is causing a lot of anxiety for some Aussies as the coronavirus situation continues to unfold.  University of NSW economist Richard Holden says Australia's banking system is very healthy and will withstand the pressures of the pandemic. He's explained how savings are guaranteed, the mortgage situation and the safety nets that are in place.  He says: ""You're better off just leaving it in the bank."" Here's his explanation of what's going on.   According to America's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people should be wearing face masks in public amid the pandemic. But that isn't yet the case in Australia. On Saturday Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said authorities were ""actively looking"" into whether to advise the general public to wear face masks, but said there was no need to do so at this time. He said ill-fitting masks could potentially cause more harm than good, because people would be constantly touching their faces as they adjusted them. Previously the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended face masks only be worn by people who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms, or those looking after someone who may have the virus.  But the WHO is also considering whether to issue new guidance to the public on wearing face masks as a way to limit the spread of the virus.  Research suggests that coughs and sneezes may project particles much further than previously thought.  But the WHO is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks — just non-medical basic cloth or fabric masks that can be purchased online or made at home.    ",,"April 05, 2020"
15,/news/2020-04-05/coronavirus-child-care-jobkeeper-symptoms-rules-restrictions/12120648,Who's eligible for free child care? Is it safe to shop? The answers to some of this week's key questions about coronavirus,"Every day, as we find out more about coronavirus, it raises more and more questions. How will it change our everyday lives? How long for? How much danger are we in? Here are the answers to some of the key questions you have been asking about coronavirus this week.   The short answer to this question is that there are a lot of rules and advice in place right now.  To make it trickier, this advice varies between all the states and territories, and there are some really hefty fines if you do the wrong thing.   No matter who you are or which state you live in, you should only be leaving the house if it's for an essential purpose.  These include:  Want to know more, like whether you can go fishing, golfing, for a drive, or to see your grandparents?  We've got more info on that here.     A trip to a supermarket to buy food is, for most people, unavoidable. It's been tough buying groceries lately, with widespread panic buying stripping shelves around the country of essentials. But what about the chance of actually catching coronavirus? One of the biggest risks when you go shopping is that you could touch a surface which is contaminated with coronavirus. Experts recommend avoiding touching your face, and washing your hands as regularly as possible. CSIRO microbiologist Cathy Moir says the risk of exposure to coronavirus from fresh fruit and vegetables is low. But fruit and veggies should all be washed before you eat them.  Read more from the experts about safe supermarket trips.   With coronavirus everywhere you look, it can be easy to start to worry when you feel a sore throat coming on.  One of the confusing things about this coronavirus is that its symptoms can be similar to what you would expect from other conditions, like cold or flu. Some people have relatively few symptoms if any, or display no symptoms when they first contract the virus, while others suddenly lose their sense of smell (this could also be a sign of a cold or bad allergies though). The odds of you having COVID-19 are still much lower than getting the common cold or flu. If you're concerned about your symptoms, here's what you should do. You can find the latest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia here. Data from the University of Sydney shows our social distancing measures are beginning to work, and Australia should be close to the peak of new infections under the current measures. But we can't get complacent — projections show scaling back our isolation regime would cause case numbers to spike dramatically. The Government is estimating almost half of the Australian workforce will get this payment over the next six months. That's a whopping 6 million people in the companies hardest hit by shutdowns and the economic downturn sparked by coronavirus. JobKeeper isn't a payment directly to employees, it's actually for employers, which then pass the money on to employees. The employer will deal with the Government, fill in the paperwork and receive the wage subsidies that keep workers on the books. Employees who are kept on the books (even if the business goes into hibernation for a while) will keep receiving their pay in their bank accounts. Still got questions? We've got more info.   Private health cover is a big expense for singles, couples and families, but can be a lifesaver if you need an operation. Now that a large amount of medical procedures have been cancelled while hospitals deal with the coronavirus pandemic, is there any value in paying for it?  There's a lot to consider when making this decision. Some health insurers are offering options for policyholders who no longer have access to services they would usually expect to claim as part of their extras cover. Consumer advocacy group Choice wants the Federal Government to suspend its loading on future premiums, for anyone who drops their health cover due to the crisis. Want to know more to help decide what's right for you? Dig deeper here.   It's a big question to answer — but your real estate agent shouldn't be answering it for you.  The Australian Tax Office is bringing in new rules which will let people affected by COVID-19 get hold of some of their superannuation early. ABC Radio's AM program found some people who had lost their jobs had been getting letters from their real estate agents urging them to consider using their superannuation to pay the rent. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has since written to real estate institutes in each state, warning agents they could face hefty fines and imprisonment for unlicensed financial advice against people's best interests. Real estate agents who advise tenants to access their super could face a maximum of five years' imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to $126,000. Agencies could face fines of up to $1.26 million.

During a six-year survey of 28 wetlands across the Fitzroy Delta and Floodplain, BirdLife Capricornia monitored species including ducks, geese, swans, waterhens, herons, ibis, spoonbills, cormorants and pelicans. The survey found a significant decrease in the overall waterbird population from 13,801 in 2014 to 3,539 in 2020. The conservation group's secretary, Allan Briggs, put the devastating decline down to prolonged drought conditions and urban development. ""It is concerning but it's a direct result of the fact that there are so many wetlands that were dried up,"" he said. ""We did have good rain at the end of February [and the] beginning of March which filled a lot of these wetlands. ""Birds had gone and moved away because there was no way for them to get any food. ""It will take some time for the birds that normally populate these wetlands to return.""   Although Mr Briggs is concerned about declining populations he is heartened by the Central Queensland community's response to protecting an endangered species. The little tern is a small, partly migratory seabird less than 25 centimetres long and found on beaches along the coasts of eastern and northern Australia and Asia. The conservation group was saddened to see beachgoers unknowingly driving over a sand bar where about 50 of the endangered birds were nesting. But when Queensland Parks and Wildlife erected a sign the community was quick to respond. ""It was heartening to see that people were not driving out onto the spit and walking out onto the spit [instead],"" he said. ""And the birds were being left alone to incubate the eggs and feed the chicks once they'd hatched. ""The birds were able to produce the next generation, which will maintain the population, because it is an endangered species and its population has declined significantly. ""If their breeding is disturbed, or they aren't able to breed, the numbers are just going to continue to decline [and] these birds will move further towards extinction.""   Sydney scientist, Richard Kingsford, and his team from the University of New South Wales, have been studying the population of waterbirds across eastern Australia since 1981. ""Our data is showing the same thing over a massive area; about a 60 to 70 per cent decline in waterbird numbers,"" he said. ""That seems to be occurring right across the board, from pelicans to ducks to the shorebirds, and it's a real problem."" Professor Kingsford says while drought conditions causes waterbirds to migrate from areas like Central Queensland, the bigger problem is the way river systems are being developed. ""Whenever we build large dams on rivers, it holds back the water that floods the wetlands and that leaves the birds with less breeding and feeding opportunities,"" he said.    Professor Kingsford says the future of bird populations depends on the decisions that are made over the next 20 to 30 years.   ""How many dams we're doing to build in northern Australia will have a huge impact on not just waterbird populations, but a whole range of different plants and animals that depend on those floods,"" he said.  ""It has consequences for people, and it has consequences for the environment that you will never get back. ""We've played that experiment in the Murray-Darling and the challenge is we need to avoid doing that in the future."" But Professor Kingsford says there is still hope.

A collaborative study led by the Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and the Doherty Institute found the drug Ivermectin stops coronavirus growing in cell culture. The next step is to determine whether it can effectively treat coronavirus in humans, and learn what a safe dosage would be. Ivermectin has been used around the world for years as a treatment for a range of conditions including head lice and scabies, and it is available as a pill, lotion and shampoo. While today praising the work of  the researchers involved in the study, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos urged people not to misuse the substance. ""There is no reason to be buying lice treatment unless you're going to be using it on your children's hair,"" Ms Mikakos said during a press conference updating Victorians on the coronavirus pandemic. ""I just want to stress that because we've heard about people overseas who have heard about potential developments and then have ingested drugs that have been used in a completely inappropriate way and have died as a result. ""I don't want to see people rushing out to their pharmacies or their supermarkets buying lice treatments now because scientists are doing this work. ""It is lethal to swallow this shampoo. We will end up with people in hospital.""  Ms Mikakos also expressed concern people might hoard the drug, leaving none for people who needed it for proven uses — something which had happened with other medications.   A US man recently died and his wife was hospitalised after they ingested a fish-tank cleaning chemical which contained a form of chloroquine, another drug which had shown some potential as a coronavirus treatment. Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute researcher Kylie Wagstaff, who led the Ivermectin study, said the team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the drug's potential. ""What we've shown is that using the drug Ivermectin we can stop the virus that causes COVID-19 growing in cells in a Petri dish,"" Dr Wagstaff said.    ""What we need to figure out now is whether those safe dosages that we know work in people are also effective on the virus.""   Ivermectin is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-parasitic drug that has previously been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, dengue, influenza and zika.  Anti-parasitic drugs, which attack organisms already in the body, are different to vaccines, which train the body's immune system to fight the disease before it is infected. Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus ""dampening down"" the host cells' ability to clear it, Dr Wagstaff said.  The findings of the study were published overnight in the journal, Antiviral Research. Victorian Deputy Chief Health Officer Annaliese van Dieman said the early results from the study were ""great"". However, she emphasised the experiments were ""in a Petri dish and not in people"" and studies took a long time to progress to clinical treatments.   Dr Wagstaff said it would be between a few weeks and a couple of months before tests could begin on human subjects. ""We're cautiously optimistic,"" she said.  ""It definitely works on the virus in the lab. The dosage is going to be the key.  ""With all anti-viral medications it's about how much can you safely give a person and how much do you need to kill the virus inside a human being and the balance between those two things is always the important point. ""So it's definitely exciting, it's definitely worth considering, so we're moving forward with cautious optimism."" The findings come as the Federal Government commits $220 million to upgrade a high-security biosecurity research facility in Geelong where vaccines for the virus are being tested.   The CSIRO-operated Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) is being renamed the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness. CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall said the laboratory was originally created to protect Australia from animal diseases such as foot and mouth, swine fever, and invasive species. ""But the emergence of Hendra virus in Australia demonstrated that diseases do not differentiate between animals and humans, so neither will we, as we step up our preparedness and response to both in a more holistic way,"" he said. ""The centre will continue to build on the expertise delivered through AAHL's extensive biosecure laboratories combined with CSIRO's expertise across science disciplines to predict, prevent and manage disease, and turn the breakthroughs of Australia's medical research community into real-world solutions for our greatest challenges, like pandemics.""

Ikaria wariootia lived during the Ediacaran period, when much of central Australia was under water. Fossils of it were found at Nilpena in South Australia's Flinders Ranges and studies published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed it was the earliest known bilaterian. Humans and most animals are bilaterians because they are symmetrical, have a mouth, an anus and a through-gut. Mary Droser, a geologist from the University of California-Riverside, said the discovery shed new light on the earliest period of history. ""It's another piece in the puzzle of understanding how animal life evolved on Earth,"" she said. ""It's your oldest relative in Australia, which is very cool — it's the ultimate Ancestory.com.   ""This is the organism that evolutionary biologists said the first bilaterian should look like, and then we find the fossil and it does look like that. ""It paints this picture of lots of weird things at the time, the beginning of bilaterians which later give rise to animal life as we know it."" Professor Droser, who has done extensive research in the Flinders Ranges, said the world would have looked very different half a billion years ago. She said most of South Australia, from the Flinders Ranges to Adelaide, would have been under water. ""It would have been a shallow sea, and the seafloor would have been covered in this pond scum, really gross to our view — you wouldn't have wanted to put your foot in it. ""This guy, Ikaria, would have been one of the very few things that moved and it ate this green scum on the seafloor — it would have been like a massive buffet. ""There weren't a lot of things that mixed and ate stuff on the seafloor; most things were sedentary and didn't move.""   Scientists knew an animal lived during the Ediacaran period and grazed on pond scum long before the Ikaria wariootia fossil was discovered. That's because the marks it made in the ground while moving and eating the scum had left a trail, which after millions of years became a trace fossil. ""Palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists had long accepted that whatever made this trail was a bilaterian,"" Professor Droser said. ""But we've never known what that organism was, we just had its burrow.  ""The discovery of this fossil is very important, because this is the fossil of the organism that made that burrow."" When the discovery was made, Professor Droser said there were celebrations. ""We weren't positive we had it at first,"" she said. ""We were able to get a laser scanner which scanned the rocks and so we got a 3D laser image of the fossil. ""Once we did that, we were really able to get a feel for the organism, so that was when we decided it was something real.""   Flinders University lecturer in palaeontology Aaron Camens said the Flinders Ranges held a wealth of information about early history. ""This is one of the few places in the world that preserves evidence of the first complex life on this planet,"" he said. ""The Flinders Ranges is the internationally recognised type section between the geological periods when there isn't complex life and when first complex life evolves.

21,/news/2020-04-04/flinders-ranges-worm-ikaria-wariootia-oldest-human-ancestor/12119120,"Ikaria wariootia, a worm found fossilised in SA's Flinders Ranges, is our oldest known ancestor","A worm-like animal that was half the size of a rice grain and lived more than 550 million years ago is likely to be humanity's oldest known ancestor.   Ikaria wariootia lived during the Ediacaran period, when much of central Australia was under water. Fossils of it were found at Nilpena in South Australia's Flinders Ranges and studies published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed it was the earliest known bilaterian. Humans and most animals are bilaterians because they are symmetrical, have a mouth, an anus and a through-gut. Mary Droser, a geologist from the University of California-Riverside, said the discovery shed new light on the earliest period of history. ""It's another piece in the puzzle of understanding how animal life evolved on Earth,"" she said. ""It's your oldest relative in Australia, which is very cool — it's the ultimate Ancestory.com.   ""This is the organism that evolutionary biologists said the first bilaterian should look like, and then we find the fossil and it does look like that. ""It paints this picture of lots of weird things at the time, the beginning of bilaterians which later give rise to animal life as we know it."" Professor Droser, who has done extensive research in the Flinders Ranges, said the world would have looked very different half a billion years ago. She said most of South Australia, from the Flinders Ranges to Adelaide, would have been under water. ""It would have been a shallow sea, and the seafloor would have been covered in this pond scum, really gross to our view — you wouldn't have wanted to put your foot in it. ""This guy, Ikaria, would have been one of the very few things that moved and it ate this green scum on the seafloor — it would have been like a massive buffet. ""There weren't a lot of things that mixed and ate stuff on the seafloor; most things were sedentary and didn't move.""   Scientists knew an animal lived during the Ediacaran period and grazed on pond scum long before the Ikaria wariootia fossil was discovered. That's because the marks it made in the ground while moving and eating the scum had left a trail, which after millions of years became a trace fossil. ""Palaeontologists and evolutionary biologists had long accepted that whatever made this trail was a bilaterian,"" Professor Droser said. ""But we've never known what that organism was, we just had its burrow.  ""The discovery of this fossil is very important, because this is the fossil of the organism that made that burrow."" When the discovery was made, Professor Droser said there were celebrations. ""We weren't positive we had it at first,"" she said. ""We were able to get a laser scanner which scanned the rocks and so we got a 3D laser image of the fossil. ""Once we did that, we were really able to get a feel for the organism, so that was when we decided it was something real.""   Flinders University lecturer in palaeontology Aaron Camens said the Flinders Ranges held a wealth of information about early history. ""This is one of the few places in the world that preserves evidence of the first complex life on this planet,"" he said. ""The Flinders Ranges is the internationally recognised type section between the geological periods when there isn't complex life and when first complex life evolves. ""The Ediacaran fossils show us some of the first complex life and potentially the first animals.

Brisbane based 3D One Australia, who specialise in 3D design and manufacturing, are aiming to double their output with the help of the public. CEO Michael Larkins said anyone with a 3D printer can help. ""We currently have 28 printers and the capacity for that is 500 pieces per day,"" Mr Larkins told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""Our neighbours have donated their warehouse so we're accepting 3D prints from around Australia from individual printer owners, universities, schools, anybody that has idle 3D printers.""   The team will send the designs to 3D printing volunteers to print and return to them. ""We then sterilise the pieces and complete the fabrication and manufacturing process before sterilising them once again and packaging them,"" Mr Larkins said. ""We then get them to the hospitals around Australia in bulk, and that's critical as the hospital administrations don't have the capacity to deal with 10 or 20 [individual] pieces of PPE. ""They need a consistent source of supply with the quality control and the ease of logistics that come with that.""     Mr Larkins said the first piece of equipment the team worked on was face shields. ""The face shield goes over the surgical mask and glasses that the medical staff are wearing as an additional layer of protection if a patient is presenting and coughing while talking to a doctor or nurse,"" he said. ""Having that shield can really make a difference in reducing transmission. ""Also, in the ER and other parts of the hospital like intubation, when trying to keep a patient alive, that piece of PPE can be critical."" Mr Larkins said all 3D printers can help with many different sized parts of the PPE equipment needed. ""Don't be worried about the power or size of the 3D printer. Reach out to us and we will find a use for it and make sure the components get to the hospitals,"" he said. ""There are printers that help different PPE products and there really is a place for every 3D printer at the moment in getting these emergency supplies to the hospitals around Australia."" The group usually uses 3D printing to create cancer treatment medical equipment and were able to quickly move over to making specific PPE parts. Mr Larkins added that they are creating 10 jobs to keep up with production demand.     ""We're agile and can change what we do quickly.

It's when life begins for them all and instantly becomes a fight to the death.   Due to a regimented and extremely aggressive breeding season in the wild, almost all Tasmanian devils are born in early April.   University of Tasmania devil researcher David Hamilton said all devils mated in mid-February and March, ready for an April birth. ""That's the best season to give birth in terms of resources,"" Mr Hamilton said. The devils will stay in the pouch until the end of winter. ""That's a good time to emerge, so it's not too cold over winter and it's not the worst time of year to be starting to fend for yourself and be away from mum,"" he said. As for the mating process, Mr Hamilton says it involves a lot of biting and fighting, and some unholy noises. ""The males and the females have pretty ridiculous battles during the mating season,"" Mr Hamilton said.  ""It's extremely aggressive.   ""They'll bite and claw at one another the whole time and this can last for a few days with the male trying to stop the female leaving dens and things. It can get pretty full on.""   The mother devil has four teats in her pouch, so only four joeys can survive. ""But they give birth to between 30 and 40, and it's the first four that get to the pouch that make it,"" Mr Hamilton said. ""So it's an early natural selection, which is a bit brutal."" Most of the surplus devils die after birth, about the size of a grain of rice. The surviving devils will spend about five months in the pouch, then the mother starts to leave them alone in the den about August. ""She will run back and forth from the den, still feeding them and lactating for them,"" he said. The young devils will spend four or five months in the den, until,  weighing a couple of kilos, they are kicked out of home in December and January and become independent.   Mr Hamilton said devils usually don't breed until their second year, but the facial tumour disease has changed that in some populations. He said generally the adults would mate, and the young ones forego a season and wait to breed when they are two years old. ""In populations where devil facial tumour disease has been in for a number of years and the adult population has been wiped out, you see a lot of breeding happening in younger animals,"" he said. ""They can breed at one [year] in those populations because there's less competition higher up the chain."" He said young devils can get bigger quicker because there are more resources.   As part of his PhD, Mr Hamilton has been studying wild populations of devils across Tasmania. The facial tumour disease has wiped out 83 per cent of the wild population. He said there hasn't been any evidence of total extinction of populations around the state. ""If you go to areas where the disease has been for 20 years now there's still devils there, but very low numbers,"" he said. ""And we've started to see some animals are able to regress facial tumours as well, so they'll start to develop a little tumour and we come back a few months later and it's completely gone. ""That's started to happen in the last few years, but we haven't seen any signs of population-wide recovery, yet.""

Now a children's book author, Blake is creating lead female lead characters who work in male-dominated industries, like science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields, to encourage young girls into new career paths from an early age. ""When I was skiing, it made sense, because it seemed like I was doing stupid things and girls are too smart to be throwing themselves off jumps and living with stinky boys, and I was always hurting myself,"" she said. ""When I moved into the research field, I noticed there were less girls there too and even fewer in technology — something wasn't adding up."" Blake said she could see the problem started with girls from a young age. Girls were simply not even considering a career in a STEM field because they assumed they were jobs for men. ""We go all the way back to before girls have started school, and by the age of six, girls are less likely than boys to believe members of their gender are really smart,"" she said. ""When you ask kids to draw a scientist, two thirds of children aged 9 to 11 draw a man.""   Blake and her co-author, Deborah Ho have, made a concerted choice to feature women in lead roles in their Talu Tales children's books. The first instalment features a female astronaut, the second a marine biologist and an archaeologist in the third.   ""Today, only 11 per cent of space explorers are women,"" Blake said. ""So not only do we see an overwhelming minority, space is such an awesome thing to look at and anyone can look up — it's a gateway science."" She hopes the books will normalise women doing STEM jobs, so when girls start considering their options, they do not have gender stereotypes in mind. ""Play and storytelling play an important role in showing young kids who they can be and what's normal,"" Blake said. ""In the children's literature space, there are a lot of gendered play games and only one fifth of best-selling children's books feature women in the lead. ""We see that as a big problem in limiting girls' beliefs in their ability at a young age."" Annabel Blake says there is a ""leaky pipeline"" as girls slowly drop out of careers in STEM as they grow older, and by the time they are choosing their own subjects at high school, the gender imbalance is obvious.

Macinley Butson is one of Australia's most promising young scientists, currently planning for a clinical hospital trial of a protective shield she has developed for breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.

28,/news/2020-04-03/coronavirus-tips-for-video-conferencing-work-social-distancing/12113224,Coronavirus means working from home — and more video calls. Here's how to make them less painful,"For many of us lucky enough to still have a job, video calls are suddenly a huge part of work. It's not new technology. And it's not new to most workplaces. But with us all having to keep our distance, the likes of Zoom, Skype and Hangouts have brought an added layer of awkward delays and pixelated faces to our meetings, staff briefings and catch-ups. And there's also the problem of  'Zoombombing'. There are ways to make the experience less painful and more productive. So mute your mic and read on. It doesn't matter how quiet you're trying to be — a headphone microphone will pick up your heavy breathing, or the scratching of your clothes brushing against it.   Your laptop mic will capture your dog, and the kids in the next room, and the kettle boiling. Every app's a little different, but every app has a mute button. Find it. It's your friend. It's only natural. Your face is right there on the screen. You're going to look at it, check your hair. Are those bags under your eyes? But business coach Colin James says you should try to avoid checking out your own video.   ""Imagine if we were all sitting in a meeting in a real space and everyone had a mirror in front of them and they just looked at themselves in the mirror,"" he tells ABC RN's This Working Life. ""That's what it looks like on these video conferences — people are just gazing wistfully at their faces."" Mr James says you should look at the camera, imagining you're looking into the eyes of the person speaking. He admits it can take practice, but says it pays off. ""The moment your eyes are distracted, the quality of the connection is compromised. But when people feel seen, then the quality of communication is enhanced,"" he says.   It's the worst. The person running a meeting explains something and asks: ""So does that all make sense to everyone?"" ""Ye- … yes … wait … after you … should I go? … sure … yes … OK,"" come the time-delayed responses, distorted as people speak over each other. The only thing worse is a follow up — ""so was that everyone?"" — which can kick it all off again. Mr James says it's easier to take a silence as an agreement, with people speaking up if they have a comment or issue.   When it comes to virtual meetings, sometimes less is more. Mr James says some people on calls can tend to ramble and ""think with their mouths"". He suggests taking some notes of what you want to say first. ""When you are contributing, contribute consciously. Bring focused intent behind your message,"" he says. ""This makes the experience much more beneficial for everyone."" To prevent the chaos of people speaking over each other or all waiting, worried they'll cut someone else off, put someone in charge.   Mr James says it works much better than just asking the group for a general response. ""It's as simple as, 'OK, I'm just going to get some points of view on this last conversation. Steve, we'll start with you. And then I'll go to Jennifer. Steve, what do you have to say?'"" ""'All right, Jennifer, and the next person I'll be talking to is Bruce. So Jennifer, what do you have to say?' ""That gives the following person a little have time to prepare. And calling people by name manages the traffic far more effectively."" He says it can also help to intervene when people have gone off track. ""Particularly when it comes to time. When you don't have that visual cue around you, you can get lost in your own head. And you may not be aware of how much time you're taking up."" For conferencing software like Zoom, the ease with which people can hop on a video call has presented a downside: all people need to gatecrash is the meeting link. Meetings have been crashed by people, and while some of it is funny, there have also been reports of crashers sharing graphic content. To stop that, don't share meeting links on Twitter or other places where people you don't want joining can find them. Also take a look at the meeting security settings — there are ways to restrict who can join and to stop people who aren't the host from screen-sharing. Whatever software you're using, the University of Melbourne's Frank Vetere wants you to temper your expectations a bit. ""There's an expectation that they be as good as face-to-face,"" he says.   ""There's a risk that we have undue expectations of the technology, that somehow it's a replacement for that more intimate connection."" Professor Vetere studies human and computer interaction and how to better design user experiences. He says a video conference is always going to be different to an in-person meeting or chat, but urges people to make the most of the advantages the tech has. ""We don't complain that telephones are not the same as face-to-face. We just accept them for what they are,"" he says. For all the annoying quirks, and the things people get wrong with video calls, Professor Vetere is still excited. He wants more people to break out of their little boxes on a Zoom meeting, explore the technology, and get creative. During, and after work.   ""People who've been remote from their partners or their families have been using this video technology for cooking together, eating together, for playing games,"" he says. ""That sort of stuff has been going on for a long, long time, we're just seeing much more overtly now. ""People are singing together, they play music together. So the idea is not necessarily new, but it's taking off a lot more."" He urges people to change things up: call on your phone instead of a laptop, switch to your phone's other camera to show the scenery around you. ""Try cooking with someone on a mobile on a video conference. It might seem a bit weird, but the actual process of trying to do that can be a lot of fun,"" he says. ""It's only through that creativity that we'll start to see what's possible and what's not. So it's a really exciting time.""

Your laptop mic will capture your dog, and the kids in the next room, and the kettle boiling. Every app's a little different, but every app has a mute button. Find it. It's your friend. It's only natural. Your face is right there on the screen. You're going to look at it, check your hair. Are those bags under your eyes? But business coach Colin James says you should try to avoid checking out your own video.   ""Imagine if we were all sitting in a meeting in a real space and everyone had a mirror in front of them and they just looked at themselves in the mirror,"" he tells ABC RN's This Working Life. ""That's what it looks like on these video conferences — people are just gazing wistfully at their faces."" Mr James says you should look at the camera, imagining you're looking into the eyes of the person speaking. He admits it can take practice, but says it pays off. ""The moment your eyes are distracted, the quality of the connection is compromised. But when people feel seen, then the quality of communication is enhanced,"" he says.   It's the worst. The person running a meeting explains something and asks: ""So does that all make sense to everyone?"" ""Ye- … yes … wait … after you … should I go? … sure … yes … OK,"" come the time-delayed responses, distorted as people speak over each other. The only thing worse is a follow up — ""so was that everyone?"" — which can kick it all off again. Mr James says it's easier to take a silence as an agreement, with people speaking up if they have a comment or issue.   When it comes to virtual meetings, sometimes less is more. Mr James says some people on calls can tend to ramble and ""think with their mouths"". He suggests taking some notes of what you want to say first. ""When you are contributing, contribute consciously. Bring focused intent behind your message,"" he says. ""This makes the experience much more beneficial for everyone."" To prevent the chaos of people speaking over each other or all waiting, worried they'll cut someone else off, put someone in charge.   Mr James says it works much better than just asking the group for a general response. ""It's as simple as, 'OK, I'm just going to get some points of view on this last conversation. Steve, we'll start with you. And then I'll go to Jennifer. Steve, what do you have to say?'"" ""'All right, Jennifer, and the next person I'll be talking to is Bruce. So Jennifer, what do you have to say?' ""That gives the following person a little have time to prepare. And calling people by name manages the traffic far more effectively."" He says it can also help to intervene when people have gone off track. ""Particularly when it comes to time. When you don't have that visual cue around you, you can get lost in your own head. And you may not be aware of how much time you're taking up."" For conferencing software like Zoom, the ease with which people can hop on a video call has presented a downside: all people need to gatecrash is the meeting link. Meetings have been crashed by people, and while some of it is funny, there have also been reports of crashers sharing graphic content. To stop that, don't share meeting links on Twitter or other places where people you don't want joining can find them. Also take a look at the meeting security settings — there are ways to restrict who can join and to stop people who aren't the host from screen-sharing. Whatever software you're using, the University of Melbourne's Frank Vetere wants you to temper your expectations a bit. ""There's an expectation that they be as good as face-to-face,"" he says.   ""There's a risk that we have undue expectations of the technology, that somehow it's a replacement for that more intimate connection."" Professor Vetere studies human and computer interaction and how to better design user experiences. He says a video conference is always going to be different to an in-person meeting or chat, but urges people to make the most of the advantages the tech has. ""We don't complain that telephones are not the same as face-to-face. We just accept them for what they are,"" he says. For all the annoying quirks, and the things people get wrong with video calls, Professor Vetere is still excited. He wants more people to break out of their little boxes on a Zoom meeting, explore the technology, and get creative. During, and after work.   ""People who've been remote from their partners or their families have been using this video technology for cooking together, eating together, for playing games,"" he says. ""That sort of stuff has been going on for a long, long time, we're just seeing much more overtly now. ""People are singing together, they play music together. So the idea is not necessarily new, but it's taking off a lot more."" He urges people to change things up: call on your phone instead of a laptop, switch to your phone's other camera to show the scenery around you. ""Try cooking with someone on a mobile on a video conference. It might seem a bit weird, but the actual process of trying to do that can be a lot of fun,"" he says. ""It's only through that creativity that we'll start to see what's possible and what's not. So it's a really exciting time.""

In other cases, uninvited users were sharing screens with the groups to stream porn. Zoom has since adjusted its default settings for educational accounts, but the flaw remains for other accounts. Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about other Zoom features, including attendee tracking, which allows meeting hosts to track whether participants are still viewing the meeting window or have shifted focus to something else for more than 30 seconds.

32,/news/2020-04-02/seven-new-species-of-peacock-spider-discovered/12110306,Seven new species of Australia's colourful 'dancing' peacock spider discovered,"The discovery of seven species of peacock spider — five of them in Western Australia — has shed new light on one of nature's most colourful critters.   Peacock spiders are tiny invertebrates that rose to fame after people added music to online videos showing their elaborate courtship dances. A research paper describing seven new species of peacock spider has been published in the journal Zootaxa by Joseph Schubert, who works for Museums Victoria as a legacy registration officer in entomology and arachnology.   ""I'd describe peacock spiders as tiny, little, colourful kittens,"" Mr Schubert said.   ""They have their own personalities and they're incredibly tiny — about the size of a grain of rice."" The peacock spider's reputation as Australia's dancing spider comes from the courtship ritual performed by the colourful males, which raise their legs and perform a 'dance' to impress nearby females. They are found throughout much of southern Australia, although the south-western corner of Western Australia is considered a hotspot. Their size makes them tricky to find in the bush, and even more difficult to observe up close.   ""I spend a lot of time on my hands and knees in the field, with my camera and a big lens, zooming in on these tiny spiders,"" he said. Among the new species — and a favourite of Mr Schubert's — is Maratus constellatus, which was discovered in Kalbarri, nearly 600 kilometres north of Perth. ""To me the colours and the markings on the abdomen look a lot like The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh, so I named it constellatus, which means starry in Latin,"" Mr Schubert said. Like many arachnids, peacock spiders are venomous, but they are completely harmless to humans.  Their prey consists of small invertebrates such as flies and moths, but unlike other spiders they don't use webs for hunting.   ""They slowly approach their prey, trying not be detected,"" Mr Schubert said. ""When within jumping distance they pounce — hence the comparison to kittens. ""They're also incredibly accurate when they jump. I've even seen them catch prey in mid-air.""   Given how appealing peacock spiders are, it is surprising that as recently as 2013 there were fewer than 10 recorded species in Australia. That number now stands at 85, thanks in part to the efforts of passionate citizen scientists across Australia. Central Coast electrician Adam Fletcher is a part-time spider hunter with volunteer non-profit group Project Maratus. Mr Fletcher said he found it satisfying to share his passion for peacock spiders with others. ""I show people a photo and they're amazed by how beautiful they are, and it's a spider — something they've grown up to hate,"" he said. ""I get a buzz from sharing that with people.  ""When you find something you know no-one else has found before, there's nothing like it. It's very exhilarating."" Mr Fletcher said he often drove hundreds of kilometres in search of spiders, and there was always something new to discover. ""You find one and you just get this drive — you just want to find more,"" he said.

But they didn't go far — they stopped at the footpath outside their Melbourne home, armed with a bucket of chalk. Max, seven, and Lenny, four, have been away from their friends since coronavirus physical-distancing restrictions came into force and the Victorian school holidays were brought forward a week. They're just two of the many children who have been spending their shutdown time drawing rainbows and encouraging messages like ""we're all in this together"" across Australian suburbs. ""It was something for the kids to make them feel connected to other people, because obviously they're feeling a little bit uncertain about staying at home and what this means, and not being able to go to the playground and the park,"" Ms Turner said.   Ms Turner first saw the idea when she was added to a Facebook group called the Rainbow Trail, which documents children and their parents drawing rainbows for others to spot. Ms Turner, a lawyer who has been spending much of her time working from home amid the shutdown measures, said it was ""something positive to be able to talk about"" with the family. ""You're not breaching any of the social-distancing rules but it's something that you can do and you can be happy and show that there's a connection.""

University of Melbourne public health researcher Lisa Gibbs said it was important to provide children with age-appropriate ways to make them feel active and capable during the pandemic.   ""It's easy in times of danger, which essentially this is, to be so concerned with protecting the child which obviously is of utmost importance,"" Professor Gibbs said. ""But in protecting the child we can sometimes treat them as passive and vulnerable, which doesn't make them feel safe.

36,/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-internet-speeds-covid19-affects-data-downloads/12107334,"Coronavirus affecting internet speeds, as COVID-19 puts pressure on the network ","The best place for internet access since millions of Australians began working from home during the coronavirus crisis is Perth, according to data supplied exclusively to the ABC.   The research, by the Monash University-linked company KASPR datahaus, assessed the internet congestion of Australia's major cities from February up until March 30, with the data exposing huge differences in the speed from city to-city. Canberra and Melbourne are experiencing the worst average internet congestion in the country, thanks to the sudden demands of the new work-from-home reality.  The nation's capital is seeing on average 6 per cent more congestion since the move to self-isolating, with Melbourne not far behind. ""[The increase] is significant,"" KASPR datahaus co-founder and Monash professor Klaus Ackermann said. ""And there's a noticeable difference in quality in Canberra and Melbourne [compared to other cities]. ""Having such a huge average shift, for some it will be pretty bad, for others it will probably be fine.""     KASPR developed a method of measuring, in real time, the most basic unit of data that can be sent over the internet, known as a ""ping"". A ping is the time these units take to travel back and forth to the US, from locations around the world, indicating the demands on online infrastructure globally. The company's analysis took a baseline reading from mid-February, and compared the time the pings took to travel up until March 30.  While there is some stress on Australia's online infrastructure, the data indicates the country is managing its congestion, particularly compared to other parts of the world.   Compared to other parts of the world, Australia sits in between Ecuador and Croatia, with a rating of 4. Malaysia is second-last, with Argentina experiencing the most pressure.  ""Malaysia is not doing so well, also Italy, while the US is mostly fine,"" he said.    Australia's internet infrastructure has been heavily discussed over the past decade, with Australia ranking 54th out of 63 nations in communications technology and 38th for internet speeds, according to the World Digital Competitiveness rankings. However, according to the NBN, the network is holding up when Australia needs it most.   The NBN, which is now available to 95 per cent of Australian households, has seen data demand increase by more than 70 to 80 per cent during daytime hours, compared to figures calculated at the end of February.  Prior to COVID-19, the NBN network processed about 5 terabits per second (Tbps) from 8am to 5pm. On Friday, March 27, data demand peaked at 9.2Tbps.  ""It's a significant lift, [but] it still remains well below the evening busy hours when data consumption on the network is at its highest,"" an NBN spokesman said.  ""Between 8pm and 10pm, it has increased by around 15 per cent to 12.4Tbps, as of 9pm on Friday."" The Australian Government-owned corporation said it had been preparing for ""this type of scenario"" and had been watching the response from countries such as Telecom Italia, which recorded a 40 per cent increase in data consumption since the start of the outbreak.   Professor Ackermann said the demands on the internet when working from home were different to the usual at-home use, with more upload data needed. ""Netflix is only download, but working from home such as Skype or Zoom meetings, requires upload also,"" he said. Internet infrastructure from a wholesaler such as the NBN is only one of many elements needed for a reliable internet connection.

37,/news/2020-04-01/coronavirus-internet-speeds-covid19-affects-data-downloads/12107334,"Coronavirus affecting internet speeds, as COVID-19 puts pressure on the network ","The best place for internet access since millions of Australians began working from home during the coronavirus crisis is Perth, according to data supplied exclusively to the ABC.   The research, by the Monash University-linked company KASPR datahaus, assessed the internet congestion of Australia's major cities from February up until March 30, with the data exposing huge differences in the speed from city to-city. Canberra and Melbourne are experiencing the worst average internet congestion in the country, thanks to the sudden demands of the new work-from-home reality.  The nation's capital is seeing on average 6 per cent more congestion since the move to self-isolating, with Melbourne not far behind. ""[The increase] is significant,"" KASPR datahaus co-founder and Monash professor Klaus Ackermann said. ""And there's a noticeable difference in quality in Canberra and Melbourne [compared to other cities]. ""Having such a huge average shift, for some it will be pretty bad, for others it will probably be fine.""     KASPR developed a method of measuring, in real time, the most basic unit of data that can be sent over the internet, known as a ""ping"". A ping is the time these units take to travel back and forth to the US, from locations around the world, indicating the demands on online infrastructure globally. The company's analysis took a baseline reading from mid-February, and compared the time the pings took to travel up until March 30.  While there is some stress on Australia's online infrastructure, the data indicates the country is managing its congestion, particularly compared to other parts of the world.   Compared to other parts of the world, Australia sits in between Ecuador and Croatia, with a rating of 4. Malaysia is second-last, with Argentina experiencing the most pressure.  ""Malaysia is not doing so well, also Italy, while the US is mostly fine,"" he said.    Australia's internet infrastructure has been heavily discussed over the past decade, with Australia ranking 54th out of 63 nations in communications technology and 38th for internet speeds, according to the World Digital Competitiveness rankings. However, according to the NBN, the network is holding up when Australia needs it most.   The NBN, which is now available to 95 per cent of Australian households, has seen data demand increase by more than 70 to 80 per cent during daytime hours, compared to figures calculated at the end of February.  Prior to COVID-19, the NBN network processed about 5 terabits per second (Tbps) from 8am to 5pm. On Friday, March 27, data demand peaked at 9.2Tbps.  ""It's a significant lift, [but] it still remains well below the evening busy hours when data consumption on the network is at its highest,"" an NBN spokesman said.  ""Between 8pm and 10pm, it has increased by around 15 per cent to 12.4Tbps, as of 9pm on Friday."" The Australian Government-owned corporation said it had been preparing for ""this type of scenario"" and had been watching the response from countries such as Telecom Italia, which recorded a 40 per cent increase in data consumption since the start of the outbreak.   Professor Ackermann said the demands on the internet when working from home were different to the usual at-home use, with more upload data needed. ""Netflix is only download, but working from home such as Skype or Zoom meetings, requires upload also,"" he said. Internet infrastructure from a wholesaler such as the NBN is only one of many elements needed for a reliable internet connection. They include the capacity and network speeds of the retailer, such as Optus, TPG or Telstra, as well as the backbone networks, such as subsea internet cables.

It will largely depend on being able to say who is safe from contracting the coronavirus, officially named SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease called COVID-19, and who still needs to stay out of harm's way.  A blood test to detect who has antibodies against the virus would be a crucial aid. An antibody test — which would identify those whose immune systems have already encountered the virus, as opposed to current tests that reveal the presence of the virus itself — will be an important part of efforts to track the true extent of the outbreak. This is because the antibody test will be able to determine whether someone has been infected with virus, even if they haven't shown symptoms.   When we get infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), one of the ways our immune system fights the virus is by making antibodies.  These small molecules bind specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (and not other viruses or bacteria), and combat the infection, mainly by preventing the virus from entering our cells.   Even after we've cleared a particular virus infection, these antibodies stay in our bloodstream, ready to protect us if we encounter the same virus again. This is the principle behind vaccination. Because antibodies are specific to a particular virus, that means if we can detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in someone's blood, we know that person has already been infected with the coronavirus. Scientists in the United States and Europe have already developed specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2.  Laboratory tests show that only antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients will bind to SARS-CoV-2 (and not to the 2003 SARS virus, for example). This tells us the test is specific.   Antibody tests are different from the current testing kits used at COVID-19 clinics, which reveal the presence of the virus itself (by detecting its genetic material), rather than our antibodies against it. That is useful for determining whether someone is currently infected, but cannot spot people who have already fought off the virus.  In contrast, the antibody tests won't be able to detect if someone is newly infected with SARS-CoV-2, as it takes our immune system a week or more to make antibodies.    So we still need to do the existing tests to accurately diagnose a current infection. Many companies have developed rapid test kits for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.  The UK is already rolling out 3.5 million antibody tests, while Australia has ordered 1.5 million antibody tests to determine whether patients who showed symptoms of fever and cough had been infected. What still needs to be tested is how specific those kits are. It's vital that these antibody test kits are only able to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and not other coronaviruses or even viruses of other types.  Otherwise, people might think they are protected against SARS-CoV-2 when in fact they aren't. Additionally, because the onset of symptoms may appear within 2-14 days after exposure, a person might test negative to the antibody test but actually be infected.  So we really still need to use the two tests together to accurately diagnose patients with COVID-19. A new test developed by NSW Health Pathology will also be able to determine whether the antibodies in the blood are able to kill the virus.  These kinds of tests will help clinicians and scientists measure exactly how soon after infection we develop antibodies, what levels are needed to be protective, and how long these antibodies stay in our body. This will also help scientists track the spread of the virus and know if someone is going to be immune to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2.   These antibody tests have been developed much more rapidly than vaccines, which are still many months away. This is because the antibody tests are done outside the body, using just a small blood sample, perhaps just a pinprick. In contrast, a vaccine needs to be injected into the body, so it has to be tested for safety as well as effectiveness.   For a vaccine, we first need to understand how the immune response to the virus itself works, because essentially a vaccine is trying to trick the immune system into thinking it's seen the virus before so it makes protective antibodies.  Then, we need to thoroughly test any candidate vaccine to ensure it doesn't make people ill. This means we probably won't see any vaccines for at least 12 months. The new antibody tests will also help guide vaccine development.  By measuring antibody levels in infected and recovered patients, we'll have a much better idea of the levels of protective antibodies a vaccine needs to elicit. While we wait for a vaccine, the new antibody tests will give scientists, doctors and public health officials much more information about who gets infected, who has already been infected and recovered, and how protected we are against reinfection. But there is still a long way to go before we can test people's blood for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and confidently say it is safe for people to go back to work or into the community without getting sick. Ultimately it is up to our community leaders and public health officials to decide when it is safe for us to resume normal life.
