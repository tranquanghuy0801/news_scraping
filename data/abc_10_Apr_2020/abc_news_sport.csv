0,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-community-sport-clubs-feeling-impact-of-pandemic/12137910?section=sport,Community sporting clubs will feel the pinch as coronavirus pandemic hits grassroots levels,"At the historic oval near my inner-suburban home, the customary seasonal transition is in eerie abeyance. The turf wicket would by now usually have been pockmarked by the boots of stampeding footballers and the goal posts erected. Instead, the thin white posts remain in their storage pods near the cricket nets, while the turf square is sprouting autumnal grass, protected by high-tech security (a flimsy rope and two small ""keep off"" signs). Workmen continue to install a new scoreboard that will display the achievements of suburban champs. But no one knows whether its luminous digits will first record goals and behinds, or runs and wickets. The scene is no doubt similar at most country and suburban grounds, the sporting and social hubs of communities that now instead host determinedly sombre socially distanced workouts.   Inevitably the media focus on the impact of the deadly coronavirus pandemic on sport has highlighted the deprivation of AFL and NRL matches and the sundry costs and contingencies.   Most recently we have been confronted by anxious administrators trying to stave off financial ruin by concocting ever more desperate measures to get players back on the field, even if playing on islands or in clusters would risk creating the potentially ruinous air of ""normality"" our political leaders have rightly suppressed.   Amid the huffing of these panic-stricken sporting bureaucrats and the unseemly haggling over the percentages to be cut from vast playing contracts, there has been a consoling thought.   Sport is not imperilled by the financial knock-ons from this deadly pandemic because sport is not merely what we see on the TV or in a packed stadium. Sport at its most basic is a kid with a bat and ball or a racquet or just a pair of runners, regardless of where the evolution of various games through codification, professionalism, mass audience appeal and ""elite performance"" has taken them. But even viewed through the rosiest lens, this does not mean the suburban warriors of community sport are immune from the havoc coronavirus has wrought at the professional levels. When various national governing bodies tightened their stranglehold on the grassroots — in some cases for the greater good — sport became, even more so, a trickle-down economy. So the loss of overall revenue generated through media rights, sponsorship and gate receipts will have a profound impact on how much support will be provided to suburban leagues and clubs. Consequently, the likely sporting depression will provide a test of the priorities and the commitment of administrators to the most important level of sport — the community base that props up the sporting pyramid. Funding for the loss-making women's professional leagues currently driving mass participation will provide a similar insight into their long-term vision.   At local level a flattened economy will have an immediate impact on community clubs that typically rely on sponsorship from the kind of small businesses — such as pubs, restaurants and real estate agents — that have taken the biggest financial hits. The explosion in entry-level and early-age junior participation has also created a steady stream of revenue for many clubs and, in some cases, a heavy reliance on junior memberships to fund overall operations. Will parents hard hit by the depressed economy continue to pay? Will kids return after a gap season in which they have formed an even greater bond with — you might say addiction to —their PlayStations and iPhones? Will senior players who already struggled to come up with their subs — or even be able to pay them — return? Most pertinently, will the governing bodies enjoying a generational benefit from the current participation boom fund their own form of stimulus package to help clubs ensure the now cash-strapped and disadvantaged can still play? Football, particularly, has a bottom-to-top financial model that has imposed sometimes outlandish fees on juniors used to prop up senior teams and even Football Federation Australia itself. This was a controversial topic before the pandemic and could now be — as much as the future of the A-League and W-League — a major source of vulnerability for the sport's continued growth.   Another key funding question for community clubs is whether government grants for infrastructure promised (and in some cases misappropriated) before the pandemic struck can still be delivered given the billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to wage relief and other emergency initiatives. The provision of female change rooms has been a key focus of government grants, given the enormous growth in girl's and women's cricket, football and Australian rules particularly. The best hope might be that grants can still be justified in order to provide stimulus for the building industry. Inevitably even the most prosperous local clubs will find themselves asking similar questions to their professional counterparts: Do they need to pay as much for that half-back or recruit the ex-first grade batsman who might have helped win a premiership?   This might not be such a bad thing for those clubs who have been caught up in the inflated premiership-chasing cash-in-hand economy that distorts the raison d'etre of some even supposedly ""amateur"" clubs. But during the hiatus it is the simple absence of the gathering of weekend tribes that will be felt most, particularly in those country towns where the people you see at the footy on Saturday afternoon might be the only ones you see all week. For now, the new scoreboard near my house merely creates an impatience for the days when its numbers will, like the faces in front of the old grandstand, light up. Offsiders will air a special on the impact of COVID-19 on community sport at 10:00am (AEST) on Sunday on ABC TV.    ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 10, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-nrl-set-to-resume-2020-season-on-may-28/12136700?section=sport,NRL plans for May 28 return amid coronavirus as Nine Network accuses league of 'mismanagement',"The NRL is planning to restart its season on May 28 amid the coronavirus pandemic, while it has been accused by the Nine Network of financial ""mismanagement"" and breaking its lucrative broadcast deal.   The ARL Commission (ARLC) made the announcement about wanting the premiership season to resume late next month following a meeting with the NRL's innovations committee on Thursday. The decision was announced after Nine released a statement on Thursday morning taking aim at the NRL's financial management, which it claimed had left clubs and players facing uncertain futures. ""The [coronavirus] situation is changing dramatically and we need to get moving,"" ARLC chairman Peter V'landys said. ""It is in the best interests of our clubs, our players, our stakeholders and importantly our fans that the competition resumes as quickly and as safely as possible. ""We have said right from the start that what we say today may need to change tomorrow. ""We will be flexible, and if the trend changes or if government restrictions change then so will we. The health and safety of our players and the general public remains the absolute priority.""   The ARLC endorsed the grand final being played as a standalone fixture in Sydney and State of Origin remaining in a three-match format this season. There is also a preference towards completing the remaining rounds of a regular NRL season rather than playing in conferences.   ""What we're leaning towards is a competition structure that looks more aligned with what we're currently got,"" ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce said. ""We've currently got support from the New South Wales Government in terms of if we adhere to public health guidelines and we make sure that our players follow those guidelines, we are able to train and play. ""Provided that we have strict measures around testing of players, and put some other protocols in place that allow us to minimise the risk of infection within the playing group and community."" Pearce, who headed up the NRL's innovations committee, said the league had not worked out when the season would be completed. ""That's the piece of work we need to do that's subject to a number of variables, one of which is government regulations,"" he said. ""If they're stringent and players aren't able to go back to their home environment that makes it difficult to expect them to be away from their kids for a long period of time. ""I think there's a lot of positives with the competition up and running again. The players, staff at clubs, services to clubs that will benefit. ""There's a lot of people that will be happy with the decision to get the competition running again."" The NRL season was suspended after two rounds last month because of coronavirus fears, with the league having made the decision a day after the AFL announced it was shutting down its competition. Nine said it had been left out of discussions on what the NRL season should look like if it resumed in the coming months. ""At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,"" the Nine Network statement read. ""But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years.""   Nine said it had provided the NRL with a substantial financial investment during its tenure as the competition's free-to-air broadcaster. ""Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on to support the clubs, the players and supporters,"" the statement read. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we've bailed them out many times, including a $50 million loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. ""It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk through a long-term plan.""   Pearce said the ARL Commission wanted to continue working with the Nine Network. ""They're a key partner for us and we intend to fulfil our contractual obligations,"" he said. ""We hope to maintain a working relationship that will work for both parties."" Nine's statement came after weeks of speculation surrounding the future of current NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg. Greenberg is currently in the final year of his contract.     AAP/ABC",,"April 09, 2020"
2,/news/2020-04-09/police-investigate-nat-fyfe-over-coronavirus-travel-ban-surfing/12139072?section=sport,Police clear AFL star Nat Fyfe over coronavirus travel ban surfing outing in Margaret River,"Police have cleared Brownlow Medallist and Fremantle Dockers captain Nat Fyfe of any wrongdoing after he was spotted surfing near Margaret River in what appeared to be breach of strict coronavirus travel bans.   Intrastate border restrictions are in place in WA, separating each of the state's nine region's from Perth, and West Australians have repeatedly been told not to travel to holiday homes or away from their primary place of residence. Fyfe drew the attention of Margaret River locals when he pulled into a beach car park at Gas Bay on Friday morning. The ABC approached the 28-year-old for comment as he walked back to a car after his surf but he declined, asking instead that his privacy be respected.   Subsequent calls were then placed to Fremantle Dockers management and Fyfe's personal manager, Jason Dover, but neither was prepared to offer comment other than to say he was driving trucks for his father, picking up a delivery of lime in Margaret River. Dockers Media manager Luke Morfesse said Fyfe was simply taking the opportunity to surf in lieu of exercise. At a media conference on Thursday afternoon, WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson confirmed police were investigating the incident. But after reviewing the matter, police released a statement on Thursday night clearing Fyfe of any wrongdoing.   ""It has been confirmed that Mr Fyfe entered the region in order to provide transport services and was waiting for a truck to be loaded when he went surfing,"" the statement said. ""As a result, Mr Fyfe had a valid exemption and was compliant with directions regarding regional travel.   ""It has further been established that Mr Fyfe did not breach social distancing requirements. ""The intent of the directions is to reduce travel in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Western Australia. ""Exemptions for regional travel do apply, but exempt travellers must only travel as required and must only stay in the region for as long as it takes to complete the essential service."" Commissioner Chris Dawson said the interpretation of the law had been examined and it had been determined that Fyfe did not commit any breaches.   ""The spirit of the law is that people apply common sense and only move to another region for the purposes of performing an essential service,"" Mr Dawson said. ""I will change my directions if I learn of people's behaviours putting others at risk. Fyfe was photographed with the captain of the Australian hockey team Aran Zalewski. Hockey Australia released a brief statement in response to enquiries from the ABC. ""When Aran is not required at Hockey Australia's High Performance Program as part of the Kookaburras, his primary place of residence is in Margaret River,"" the statement said. ""There is certainly no intention on his part not to follow the Premier's directive."" In WA travelling into another region without a valid reason could result in a fine of up to $50,000.",ABC South West WA,"April 09, 2020"
3,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-pandemic-will-change-afl-in-the-future/12131660?section=sport,AFL to be played in 'very different landscape' after coronavirus pandemic,"The game of Australian Rules football has changed constantly over its 160-odd-year history. Laws have been tweaked and tactics have evolved.   Even the shape of the field and ball are different to what they once were. The sport now appears headed into another period of upheaval — one brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the financial havoc it has wrought. Thoughts are turning to what the football world will look like on and off the field with a drastically reduced budget thanks to the slashing of income through TV money, gate takings and other commercial opportunities. ""It is no doubt going to be a very different landscape,"" St Kilda's head of football program David Rath said.   ""We're still waiting to hear from the AFL what those constraints are. ""But even then, I think what we'll find is going to be a new world."" If one thing is certain, it is that clubs will be forced to cut their off-field football spending.     It is an area that had become bloated, according to some critics, with a myriad of assistants, development coaches, sports scientists, welfare managers and analysts added to clubs' payrolls in the past two decades. To curtail that arms race, the AFL introduced what was known as a soft cap on football department spending, which was set at $9.7 million before the coronavirus shutdown. Clubs could still spend more, but were taxed for every dollar spent over the limit.  That cap will be reduced — and perhaps hardened — as the league adapts to its new financial circumstances.   ""All clubs will have to be much more frugal in how they're spending money,"" Rath said. ""I don't think anyone will be in a position to be splashing out to gain a massive advantage."" Four-time premiership coach David Parkin believes a cut in non-playing football staff may prove to be a fillip to a game he feels has had some of the joy sucked out of it. He cites a conversation he had with Brownlow medallist Sam Mitchell and other Hawthorn midfielders, who described to him the amount of coaching they received at Hawthorn. ""They were averaging 92 stoppages per game, and every one of those stoppages somebody had pre-determined what their starting position was and what their role was from that starting position,"" Parkin said.   ""And they were outwardly and honestly talking about how much their sheer enjoyment, the fun of playing had been reduced for them."" Parkin hopes having fewer coaches will allow footballers to play with more creativity and spontaneity. ""I think initially we might get a better game for all participants — easier to umpire, better to watch and more fun to play,"" he said.   But Rath, who was one of those coaching Mitchell at the Hawks, does not subscribe to that theory. ""I don't think it's as simple as more coaches mean more structure,"" Rath said. ""If you look at how the game's been played over the last couple of years, it's had an element of chaos that hasn't come about because there's been fewer coaches. ""There's been more coaches than five or six years ago when it was incredibly structured."" Style issues aside, there is a human face to the changes sweeping the AFL. Real people are losing real jobs.   One of them is Nathan Burke. Overnight, his full-time position as the Western Bulldogs' AFLW coach was cut to seven hours per week. ""They're [AFL clubs] probably going to have to look at their whole business model of how much do they put into their next-generation academies, their school programs and their community programs,"" Burke said. ""And they need to decide — what's our core business? Do we cut out an assistant coach or do we cut somebody from the marketing department?"".   But befitting someone who has been a pioneer of analytics and strategy in football, Rath believes the clubs and coaches who adapt fastest to the new environment will be the ones to succeed. ""It's probably the clubs that innovate quickest that get the biggest advantage in that space,"" Rath said. ""Some of what we're doing in six months' time will be different to what we're going to be doing in 18 months' time. Footy has this amazing ability to adapt."" It will have to. The golden days of clubs spending every cent that comes in and often more are gone. Footy will eventually be back, but it will not be the same.

4,/news/2020-04-09/online-gaming-hits-huge-numbers-during-coronavirus-pandemic/12135714?section=sport,Online gaming is getting a big boost from the coronavirus pandemic — and experts say it's just the beginning,"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, most Australian parents would agree that online gaming was a lot more than just a growing trend.   Already a hundred-billion-dollar global industry, online gaming has become a popular pastime for many, and even a full-blown profession for some. Dedicated esports arenas, huge tournaments and the migration of traditional sport into the virtual world in recent years have proven it was already here to stay. But off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, the proliferation of online gaming in households is predicted to go to the next level. James Birt, Associate Professor in Information and Computing Science at Bond University, has studied emerging technology for the past 20 years and says he is seeing record-breaking levels of participation.   Some game manufacturers across the world have reported downloads have more than doubled, while a staggering 1.2 billion hours of content was consumed on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""The number of people playing games is off the charts, we have never seen this many players streaming and playing simultaneously online, in the history of gaming,"" Associate Professor Birt said. Earlier this week, Twitch reported it had more than 4 million concurrent viewers on its platform for the first time, after the release of Valorant, by Riot Games. ""I think what COVID-19 has really created is this point in time that one could say, is when this movement happened,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""Kids, esports enthusiasts, just [the] general public are getting into games in a way that they have never done in history. ""What we see now is those people that hadn't engaged in esports and gaming prior to the pandemic are now driving in droves towards new opportunities new experiences, new collaborative opportunities with friends.""     Motorsport is one of a number of Australian sports well placed during the downtime to take advantage of the booming interest and willingness of fans to watch online games. The inaugural All Stars Eseries event took place on Wednesday night and saw drivers competing remotely against each other online, in the first of 10 rounds. It was broadcast live on Fox Sports and streamed across multiple social platforms.   The competition followed the script from recent years in Supercars, with 2018 and 2019 series champion Scott McLaughlin winning two of the three races. The first two races featured the Phillip Island virtual circuit, while the final race was held using a digital version of the famous Monza track, home of the Italian Formula One grand prix. Like almost all of Australian sport, the traditional Supercars series — in which drivers and teams compete on tracks around the country — is on hold because of the pandemic. Instead, simulators have been installed in the homes of 25 drivers, who are getting used to the idea of getting suited up and racing the competition from the comfort of their own living space.   Holden driver Chaz Mostert has welcomed the initiative. ""Supercars has done all that it can to set this up so we can at least keep the fans entertained at home … I'm sure it's killing people like myself who wish we were racing, on the track, but we're making do with what we can at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a bit different, strolling down the stairs and going into the garage [to the simulator], it's a bit more unique than getting on a plane and going to a round!"" Similar moves are taking place in the United States, where NBA players have been pitted against each other in a special NBA 2K tournament, set to broadcast on ESPN. It is an example of how esports can also showcase sports stars in a unique way, by cutting to player reactions and banter over a mix of gameplay. Associate Professor Birt says many sports should be looking to take advantage of the unique opportunities that online gaming presents, given sports entertainment can now easily cross digital borders. ""The increase in the power behind the computing and the capacity to present the materials in 4K, we really are moving towards photo-realism in our games,"" he said. ""We are going to see even more dramatic increases this year with the release of things like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox [Series X],"" he said.   Mostert himself has been blown away by the quality of the visuals in his gaming experience, and said he was interested in being able to see the races on replay to get a different perspective from the simulator. ""I think we [drivers] are like fans, we're still going to be watching [the replay] tomorrow, even though the race happened today,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to having good on-track battles as well, it's still the same competition that we're used to out in the real world, and no doubt we'll still be racing for sheep stations in the virtual world as well."" With traditional sport still in a pandemic-induced hiatus, esports is expected to further develop its role in the Australian sporting landscape in the months ahead. ""I think there is this incredible blend between the technical capacity of esports to essentially get into people's living rooms,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""What television hasn't been able to do is create that connection between players, the games and the brands.""    ",By Patrick Galloway,"April 09, 2020"
5,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-roger-federer-gives-tennis-lesson-on-social-media/12133464?section=sport,Roger Federer gives social media tennis lesson while self-isolating during coronavirus pandemic,"Roger Federer has a bit of spare time on his hands at the moment, with professional tennis on hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic.   But that has not stopped the 20-time major singles champion from keeping himself busy by offering tips to his legion of fans around the world, who are also stuck at home because of self-isolation and social distancing measures. Federer took to Twitter and Instagram with a short video to showcase what he described as a ""helpful solo drill"" for all the tennis enthusiasts looking to improve their volleying skills while confined to their dwellings. He tapped the ball more than 200 times during the test of reflex and form in the 59-second video.   Federer did not stop there, however, going one step further by encouraging his followers and other social media users to reply to him with their own videos mimicking the volleying exercise he displayed so he could give some feedback.   There was some extra advice as well, with the Panama-hat wearing Federer directing users to ""choose your hat wisely"".   Within six hours, Federer's video garnered more than 1 million views, and his post drew more than 1,300 replies. Many of those replying to Federer got inventive, with two sisters teaming up to mimic a typical on-court exchange between a player and a ball kid.   ""Classic, you guys are funny,"" Federer replied. Federer also apologised to the father of one of his fans, who had interrupted a Zoom meeting by volleying against a wall at home while wearing a sombrero.   ""That was the right choice of hat, love the effort, sorry to your dad!"" wrote Federer alongside a series of smiling and laughing emojis. To another tweet, in which a man hit a tennis ball against an indoor wall while a dog appeared to nap underneath, Federer answered: ""Love the confidence not to drop the [tennis ball emoji] on the [dog emoji].""   Federer replied to a number of other tweets, often complimenting their choice of headwear and dispensing a little advice.   ""Don't lean back, strong in the wrist,"" Federer wrote to one Twitter user.  ""Keep up the great work."" Federer, who holds the record for most major singles trophies won by a male player, has previously posted clips of himself hitting against a wall in the snow, including around-the-back or through-the-leg ""tweener"" trick shots. The 38-year-old, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in February, is waiting — along with every other professional player — for competitive tennis to return. The men's and women's professional tours are suspended until at least mid-July because of the COVID-19 pandemic.       ABC/AP",,"April 08, 2020"
6,/news/2020-04-08/dana-white-says-ufc-island-is-on-the-cards/12131734?section=sport,UFC president Dana White says he has secured an island to hold international MMA fights,"With world sport searching for ways to get around the coronavirus pandemic, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is talking up the possibility of holding fights on a private island.    UFC president Dana White said a fight between lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson had been scrapped, with Nurmagomedov apparently unable to leave Russia amid the pandemic. American Justin Gaethje is the new man to replace Nurmagomedov at UFC 249 at a yet-to-be-determined location. ""I'm this close to getting a deal done so this place where this fight is going to be on April 18th, I have locked up for two months. So I'm going to continue to pump fights out,"" White told ESPN.   ""I've also secured an island. I've got an island. The infrastructure is being built right now.   ""We're going to do all of our international fights on this island."" White gave no indication where the island was located. The last UFC event was on March 15 in the Brazilian capital Brasilia. It became the first event in UFC's history held behind closed doors after the Governor of the Federal District that includes Brasilia declared a ban on all large gatherings in response to coronavirus. Since then, a UFC fight night in London was also cancelled, as were two other cards due to be held at UFC's headquarters in Las Vegas. Although White still has not even announced a venue for UFC 249, he remains determined to hold the pay-per-view show. White wrote on Twitter: ""The fight is signed and is 100% ON LIVE on ESPN somewhere on EARTH!!!!"" Most US states have restrictions in place that would make it impossible to stage a show, even without an audience.     UFC 249 initially was slated for Brooklyn, but a venue change became necessary several weeks ago. ESPN, the UFC's broadcast partner, has said White was attempting to secure an unnamed venue on the west coast for the show. ""I'm terrified and I … love it,"" Gaethje tweeted after the announcement of his fight. Nurmagomedov announced last week that he wasn't planning to leave his native Dagestan, suggesting Russia's travel restrictions in response to coronavirus made it impossible. He later claimed he would be willing to leave for the fight but couldn't plan because he didn't know where or when it would occur. Australian UFC champion Alex Volkanovski said he was confident White could make the project work. ""It is crazy but if anyone is going to do it, it's Dana White,"" he said.   Volkanovski, a former concreter from New South Wales' south coast, has resumed training after recovering from a broken hand he sustained during his title-winning fight in Las Vegas last December. The 31-year-old was hoping to begin the defence of his featherweight title in Australia but said he was open to the possibility of joining the UFC island project. ""I wanted to defend that belt on home soil, but it just not looks like that's happening. I think that's definitely going to have to be postponed,"" Volkanovski said. ""Now that the coronavirus has come up, I'm thinking why we don't just go and fight on an island for a while?"" With the coronavirus pandemic set to disrupt almost all major international sporting competitions for the foreseeable future, Volkanovski said White's idea might be a silver lining for sports fans around the world. ""We could be stuck in this for a long time and if this is the only way of bringing money for me and my family, I might have to do it,"" he said. ""If it does happen, the world will be watching — especially in the times we're in right now.  ""If we can make it work, why not give it a crack?""   The island idea is not new, with the NRL admitting it is considering a range of options including moving its entire competition to Tangalooma — on Moreton Island off the Queensland coast — to keep the players quarantined. The AFL has suggested the possibility that teams could be sent to a number of ""hubs"" in different states in a bid to get the season off the ground. The idea would involve some teams based in Tasmania and Western Australia, where there are lower COVID-19 infection rates and a possible earlier end to self isolation and restrictions than elsewhere in Australia. However AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield has described the idea as ""speculative"" and said he wasn't sure how comfortable he was with it.     ABC/Wires",,"April 08, 2020"
7,/news/2020-04-08/sport-jobkeeper-coronavirus-delivery-driver/12129364?section=sport,JobKeeper subsidy could be the coronavirus reality for some in professional sport,"When there's no sport due to coronavirus, what's a professional sports club to do?   For A-League football club Central Coast Mariners, the crisis means transforming itself into a charity with the help of the Government's $130 billion JobKeeper package. The enormous wage subsidy scheme, set to be made law today, will give some relief to thousands of workers in the sports sector that have been stood down, including high-level athletes.   And some coming off contract could have deals extended to make the most of the JobKeeper scheme. The Mariners stood down more than 50 staff and players last week. Chief executive Shaun Mielekamp is looking to transform the operation, based an hour north of Sydney, into an aid hub for the region by launching a community support line. Mr Mielekamp said the JobKeeper package would allow the club to keep staff engaged and redeploy them in various community support roles. ""Those staff that are able to come in for one or two days a week, we'll be able to speak to members, do deliveries for our senior citizens in the region, help them with internet issues, or just have a general chat and touch base to make sure that they're all okay,"" he said.   ""It's something that the chairman (UK-based Mike Charlesworth) is really passionate about, that all resources at the club during this period of time need to be focused on community work. ""The JobKeeper [subsidy] will increase the resources that we have to throw back into the community right now."" Players and staff at English Premier League clubs including Bournemouth, Watford and West Ham have undertaken community outreach and aid in recent days. Mr Mielekamp said he was also open to keeping off-contract players around so they could access the wage subsidy. ""If there's the opportunity to have a short-term bridging extension to the contract, that could benefit some of the players that are coming off contract,"" he said. ""And as we move into thinking about a new season, a lot of those issues are going to be really important.""   Roughly 80 per cent of workers at AFL clubs have been stood down.   Western Bulldogs AFLW coach Nathan Burke said his work had dropped to seven hours per week, equivalent to an 80 per cent pay cut. ""I'm still doing exit interviews and making sure they (the players) are all okay,"" Burke said. ""So that's a little bit of a role, but how long will that last for? I don't know."" Mr Mielekamp said the Mariners would be looking to bring back the workers that have been stood down, to work on the community support line, using JobKeeper wage subsidies. The Government's flagship $130 billion package promises to subsidise wages of workers at businesses which have been affected by the coronavirus downturn, providing $750 per worker, per week for up to six months.   Employers are required to keep employees on the books and pass on the subsidy in full. Burke, a veteran of over 300 AFL games for St Kilda said many at the Western Bulldogs are waiting for the JobKeeper payment to be approved. ""We hope this JobKeeper thing comes through basically,"" Mr Burke said. ""That's sort of what we're relying on at the moment because who knows when footy's going to start again?"" For those stood down, it means some income and the chance to resume previous responsibilities when the crisis subsides. At the Mariners, it would likely mean staff working on a pro-rata arrangement based on their previous salary. Until the legislation is passed by Parliament, few are prepared to say for sure what impact JobKeeper will have on sport. Across major sporting codes, staff and senior men's players are expected to be eligible for the subsidy. But others are less fortunate. For example, it's unlikely W-League footballers will be eligible because their contracts only cover them for the 14-game season which ended last month.   Already all AFL clubs have applied for the scheme, and many NRL clubs have joined them. The New Zealand Warriors were paid almost half a million dollars this week as part of that country's wage subsidy scheme. While the $750-per-week payment is far less than many sport stars earn, it can even mean a pay increase for juniors, journeymen and women — if they're eligible.   John Didulica from the PFA, the body representing footballers in Australia, said many low-income players will be eligible, but it won't come close to solving the real problems that the players will face. Annual payments for one in eight players in the A-League are below the minimum wage equivalent across a full year. ""The players are likely to face short-and-long term unemployment — or their careers coming to a premature end,"" Mr Didulica said. ""With this comes a greater predisposition to mental health concerns. ""In this context, it is critical that clubs work with us to solve the game's acute challenges.""   Players at most A-League clubs have been told they will be stood down and not be paid. That's in contrast to the AFL and NRL, where players have struck deals to protect some of their earnings in coming months. A-League footballers will meet with clubs later this week. ""Worryingly there is no long-term solution for the over 40 per cent of players who are coming off contract at the end of May,"" Mr Didulica said.

With no end date in sight and no meaningful projections about when the curve will be sufficiently flat, we are left with guesstimates about the cost of lost media rights, memberships and sponsorships. Yet the desperate measures being proposed to defy the lockdown with early start-ups, and the hit lists of potential cost savings, provide a measure of sport's vulnerabilities and also its priorities. The idea of putting all the NRL players on an island is just the most unintentionally hilarious consequence of years of profligate spending by self-interested club warlords. More grim are the murmured threats by AFL and NRL clubs to axe their women's teams, something that betrays not only the depth of the financial crisis but the indifference of some toward the still-embryonic women's leagues. Making an AFLW or NRLW club the first victim of a flattened sports economy will no doubt play well with those observers who have moaned that women's football in various codes has been a financial drag on male competitions, those whose first response upon seeing an image of the crowd of 53,034 that attended the 2019 AFLW grand final at Adelaide Oval was: ""Yeah, but they didn't have to pay to get in.""   Presumably few such critics have been to a suburban ground on a weekend morning and watched the thousands of young girls now playing football, Australian rules, the two rugby codes and cricket — sports that were once virtually exclusive male domains.   They certainly have not been on the committee of a local club trying to find enough grounds and coaches to satisfy the demands of all the girls now wanting to play cricket or footy. Accordingly, they would not understand the profound change in the sports participation dynamic caused by the growth of new women's leagues, one best explained by the different ways boys and girls had previously been engaged by sports. Put simply, boys have usually played the various kinds of footy and cricket just because they did. Personally, growing up in a small rural town, participation was not so much a matter of choice as a rite of passage.   Changes in lifestyles, greater financial prosperity, advances in technology and a far broader choice of activities have changed the participation model greatly.   Yet that same entry-level rationale for those boys who do choose footy and cricket remains. Heroes and role models continue to inspire continued participation as players or spectators, and inform the goal of one day competing at the top level. But scratch the surface and boys mostly continue to play the various football codes and cricket, particularly, because boys always have. A similar dynamic has existed in what we might once have called ""girls sports"". Girls would play netball, basketball, tennis, softball and field hockey because that was what girls played and not necessarily because they saw top-flight players do it. A few played cricket, even fewer the various types of football because participation was not encouraged, and — in the case of rules that stopped involvement in football beyond early ages — was actively discouraged. Then came perhaps the greatest change in the history of Australian sport's participation, the institution of professional female cricket and football leagues — the WBBL, the W-League, AFLW, NRLW, Super W — along with improved promotion and better pay deals for the Australian women's cricket team and the Matildas. The timing of entry, financial commitment and visibility of sports forming women's leagues has varied. Football got a significant jump with mass junior female participation, while cricket led the way with increased pay. But the impact of these leagues and their stars at the grassroots level has been enormous because they have altered the participation dynamic.   Girls are not just playing the sports they always have, but are now constantly being shown they can play others. In this regard, it is not too far-fetched to suggest high-profile female stars — such as the Matildas' Sam Kerr, cricketer Ellyse Perry and the AFLW's Tayla Harris — are more important in driving participation in their sports than their better paid and more celebrated male contemporaries. Please do not misinterpret this. The female stars are demonstrably not more important in attracting the revenue sources that fund major leagues and professional teams, including media rights deals, sponsorship and gate attendance.   Women's leagues are for now mostly loss making. But when you consider the vast number of girls playing cricket and various kinds of footy, they are also loss leaders — investments that create a significant benefit beyond the cost itself. Several years ago the AFL produced a study that revealed participants who remained engaged in the game as players, umpires or volunteers beyond their teenage years were six times more likely to be lifelong consumers of the game.   They are the membership ticketholders, TV eyeballs, purchasers of merchandise and others who underpin the game's finances and who will continue to do so beyond the costly current pause. This is why AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has been quick to contradict those club bosses privately speculating about axing their women's programs, insisting all 14 AFLW clubs will survive. The sports which find a way to cut their diminished financial cloths and stay the course with women's leagues will be significant beneficiaries of their far-sighted approach. Those who blink will find the short-term savings come at the cost of the growth they will desperately need in an even more challenging market.  ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 07, 2020"
9,/news/2020-04-05/former-wallabies-captain-critical-rugby-australia-leadership/12122714?section=sport,"Former Wallabies captains make a move against Rugby Australia leadership, warning of financial crisis ","Rugby Australia is headed for insolvency, with serious questions raised over the management of the game by the board and its chief executive, Raelene Castle, according to one of the sport's most revered elders. Former World Cup-winning captain, Nick Farr-Jones, has told The Ticket that with ""ongoing concerns"", the board must be wary of being ""in breach of the Corporations Act"". ""I wouldn't be surprised if an administrator was appointed in the next fortnight,"" he said. It is understood that up to 15 former Wallabies captains have been discussing the future of rugby in Australia and are unified in their thinking that substantial change at the top is necessary. Their discussions are ongoing and separate to RUPA's (Rugby Union Players' Association) frustrations with the governing body. Incomplete financial records were finally shared with the players' association early on Saturday morning after being withheld by Rugby Australia for the past four weeks. The financial information was delivered to RUPA along with a demand that the 192 players come to terms with Rugby Australia by 5:00pm on Sunday otherwise decisions would be made without the players' agreement. Adding to speculation that RA's chief executive may be shown the door, RUPA chief executive Justin Harrison hinted midweek that there was a move against the current administration.   ""Look, we know that there are people who are willing and able to participate in a restructuring of the game itself,"" he told ABC NewsRadio. ""It is both reflective and forward-looking and ensuring that all of the stakeholders are involved in something that brings it back to a community-based, more encompassing model."" Harrison described the plans as a ""pipeline of adventure"" that would be considered once a player payment deal was struck for the duration of the coronavirus sporting hiatus. ""We'll need to entertain [that] once we get through what everyone's experiencing at the moment, which is extreme uncertainty and extreme adversity,"" he said.   While several former Wallabies captains were approached by The Ticket, only Farr-Jones agreed to speak publicly about the current state of the game. ""I understand reserves are minimal … there're no games happening, we have no broadcasting deal and I think sponsors would see rugby as very much on the nose at the moment — so they're the three areas where you get your income,"" he said. ""As soon as they [Rugby Australia] cut a deal with the players, one would expect there'd be a liability that will crystallise and if I was sitting on the board … I would really be looking at the going concern issues. ""If you have going concern issues, and you don't want to breach the Corporations Act, well then you go into what's known as VA, or voluntary administration.""   He said the game had been in demise for several years with responsibility for poor judgment to be shared by the board and the chief executive. ""Absolutely I think there has been some very poor board decisions, I think that executively the game has been very poorly managed,"" Farr-Jones said. ""You look at the sponsorship situation, you look at bums on seats and the declining viewership on TV which of course leads to issues in relation to how you can sell your broadcasting rights. ""You look at the judgment of the chief executive and the board in not accepting the Fox broadcasting deal and whether that's left us in this very precarious situation — of course there's responsibility. ""And you look at the abysmal way that Rugby Australia handled the [Israel] Folau case and got bullied by senior sponsors into making a very stupid decision and then you later — a long time later — read the lack of communication between teammates and coaches.""   Fox commentator and former Wallaby captain Phil Kearns has been named as a likely replacement for Castle, a suggestion Farr-Jones says he would support. ""I think you need someone to come in who is a trusted pair of hands, who knows the game inside out, who is trusted by broadcasters, by sponsors, by fans — someone who can at least shine a bit of light down the tunnel,"" he said. Kearns applied for the chief executive position in 2017 which ultimately saw Castle appointed, an appointment Nick Farr-Jones said the board got wrong. ""I really believe that you have to have a deep knowledge of the game to take on the role of chief executive,"" he said. ""You have to understand intricately who the people are in world rugby, intricately about the community game, and you can't be learning on the job.   ""That was the mistake I think the board made, it was a very bad mistake, and Phil Kearns has got three and a half decades of being intricately involved in the game. ""He knows people, he's trusted by people, he's been in broadcasting for a long time and that is the most important thing — that Rugby Australia has to lock away a broadcasting deal — he would be great in securing sponsorship if he took over, and he'd be great with fans. ""We need bums on seats and we need the rusted-on rugby people who we've lost to come back to the game. ""It's going to take some tough decisions to get the culture of the game back, the rusted-on supporters back, and for people to have faith in the game."" RUPA and Rugby Australia are expected to meet at some stage on Sunday afternoon — essentially over the coronavirus pay deal — but with possible ramifications that will last well beyond the current pandemic.

Some clubs may not survive the carnage and the league itself is in a fight for its survival, according to NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg. What lies ahead is a daunting task for Greenberg and the Australian Rugby League Commission. But the man in charge said ""adversity brings enormous opportunity"" and the game was seriously considering a range of innovations to raise much-needed cash and potentially relaunch the season. ""We have enjoyed unbelievable growth particularly over the last five years,"" Greenberg said.   ""The cold hard reality is we're going to have to reset our cost base for the future. ""The whole game's going to feel that — coaching departments, football departments, player salaries, executive salaries, the amount of work we can do in some of the programs that we've enjoyed running.   ""They're all going to have to take a reset, that's just a realistic view. ""We're going to get through this coronavirus but what's on the other side of that? ""I think a very significant economic downturn [is on the other side] and we have to be realistic about setting a cost base that reflects potentially a difference in revenues."" Greenberg admitted some clubs would have to fight for survival. With no games on, clubs are getting no money from ticketing, and memberships, corporate hospitality and sponsorships are under threat. Plus many of clubs, particularly the eight based in Sydney, rely on their leagues clubs to bring money in, but now those have had to close as well. ""It's not going to be an easy period of time, there's no simple or easy solutions, except we need all 16 [teams] to come out the other side,"" Greenberg said. ""We need some really strong leadership across our clubs and we have to have realistic expectations around the cost base of the game.""   The NRL said it hoped to be back on the field by July 1 and was seriously considering some outlandish ideas to get players back on the field amid the global pandemic.   Moving the whole competition to Gladstone in central Queensland, or to Tangalooma — on the picturesque Moreton Island off the Queensland coast — to keep the players quarantined, remains on the table.   ""We haven't ruled anything out and we'd be crazy to rule out anything at this point in time because there's so much uncertainty,"" Greenberg said. ""There's still a model on the table of an aggregated position where you put all 16 clubs in one location. ""There are risks and opportunities with every model — Gladstone was one, there was another one on an island where we would put all the players and we would transport them back. ""All of those things are in consideration, but they're tricky, some of them have got risks associated with medical care and how you put the players in one place."" Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) chief executive Clint Newton said the players wanted to get back to playing and training and were willing to go along with any of the NRL's plans, provided they were safe. ""That's absolutely paramount through this process,"" Newton said.   ""Provided it is safe and they aren't put at any adverse risks, then they'll explore all options."" The NRL has put together an innovation committee, the mission of which is to think outside the box and avoid looking through the prism of what's been done in the past for the premiership. A three-game grand final series is being considered.   So is a wildcard weekend, which would see teams finishing ninth and 10th play off against the seventh- and eighth-placed teams, with the winning sides to advance to the finals. ""Sometimes you don't get those opportunities when you're in the back-to-back cycle of seasons,"" Greenberg said. ""This is probably the one year where we do get to challenge that."" Last week, the NRL showed it was taking a more unified approach to the game, coming to terms on a financial agreement with the RLPA in record time.   It will see the players paid two months of wages, a total of $24.6 million. They will also surrender five months' salary if the competition is unable to resume. ""Rugby league is pretty famous for having some good stoushes and those being played out in the media,"" Greenberg said. ""What I'm really proud of over the last two weeks is that unified approach where everyone's put down their own self interests for the greater good. ""All credit to the players and the players association, who have been unbelievably respectful through the process. ""They asked a lot of difficult questions of me and we had to be really open and transparent about it. ""I've had more conversations with players in the last two weeks than perhaps in the 12 months prior, but I actually think it'll bring us closer together …  for the future.""   The RLPA was also happy with the outcome, with Newton saying it gave players ""a level of certainty and clarity over the next few months"".   There are concerns the NRLW could be a casualty of cost cuts, but Greenberg insisted the women's game was more important now than ever. ""I would like to think that we can continue to play NRLW and continue to grow women's sport,"" he said.   ""Participation is going at 20 per cent growth year on year for young girls playing around the country, but we have to find a cost-effective model in order to do that. Greenberg said the league was in constant conversation with NRLW players and clubs to try to ensure their survival. ""We've got to try and figure out an economic model to make sure that continues,"" he said. Despite the challenges in front of him Greenberg remains optimistic about the future, with a sport-starved population waiting on the other side of this crisis. ""When people can go back outside and can interact with their friends, what better way to do it that at live sport?"" he said. ""I get a sense that people will be absolutely salivating to go and watch their team and their club.""  ",By Michael Rennie,"April 05, 2020"
11,/news/2020-04-03/can-australian-sporting-codes-work-together-amid-coronavirus/12117364?section=sport,The battle between Australia's sporting codes is fierce but will coronavirus teach them to play nice?,"A crowded house with two parents trying to work while restless kids beg to be taken to a playground they have been told a hundred times is now closed. An awkwardly spaced office or factory floor; a coffee shop window where you are not quite sure whether you're supposed to make eye contact with fellow customers from your 1.5-metre vantage point. And this is not to mention the far more confronting toll taken by COVID-19 in death and illness. The big and the small — sing along — ""We're all in this together"". This now includes some potentially uncomfortable bed mates: the grand poohbahs of Australia's competing professional sports. The first crumbs on the bed linen were apparent this week when the hypothetical issue of stadium availability in the event of an elongated AFL season was raised.   Over decades the AFL has used its vast revenue-raising spectator appeal to encroach on cricket's seasonal boundaries, advocate the replacement of natural turf pitches with drop-ins while strategically planting announcements and events in the sunny months to dominate the media agenda. Yet the usually all-powerful AFL could find itself in a rare moment of negotiating weakness should it require access to stadiums booked by cricket in order to maximise now precious revenue.     Cricket has, at least for now, the T20 World Cup, a lucrative Test series against India and the start of the Big Bash League to accommodate, all events that could minimise its losses. The reaction of the AFL's chief executive officer Gillon McLachlan to suggestions his game could be locked out of stadiums was in the spirit of the times: ""I hope in the end this is bigger than all of that and I've been talking to other sports on other fronts, we will all work together …"".   The coffee sprayed from snorting noses upon hearing this sentiment belonged to the organisers of Australia's failed 2018/2022 World Cup bid who felt they were blocked at every turn by the AFL over stadium availability and FIFA's requirement that rival sports pause their seasons. (An exception will be then-FFA chief executive Ben Buckley who has returned to the AFL as chairman of North Melbourne and had other matters, including suggestions his team would be shipped to Tasmania, on his plate this week). Yes these are extraordinary times and, as the AFL-friendly Melbourne sports media was quick to suggest, it might be a matter of ""community interest"" (i.e. ""The AFL owns this town!"") that dictates what is played where should cricket and footy seasons collide. But seeing Australia's most voracious sporting shark suddenly acting like just another goldfish in the bowl was, at the very least, a cause for some mirth among those who had felt its bite. Wisely, Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts rose above the fray suggesting his organisation would cooperate with the AFL if it needed a venue for a December grand final.   Why start a battle with a local rival to protect cricket games that, given the continued spread of the pernicious virus, might very well be cancelled or postponed? No doubt those ecumenical sports fans who don't like hearing about ""code wars"" will have blanched at the mere suggestion of confrontation during the coronavirus pandemic having naively assumed the games they love should be able to get along just fine. But behind the scenes the rivalry between Australian sports has only intensified over the years, whether that was for so-called ""first choice"" athletes, stadium access/configuration or, at a community level, increasingly crowded local playing fields.   The pandemic has merely highlighted what the savviest administrators have long understood — four major professional football codes cannot continue to expand revenue and support bases in a small market at their current rate; even less so now Fox Sports is under duress and sponsorship dollars are diminishing. This has meant decisions have often been made not only in the best interests of a particular code, but as a strategic buffer against rivals — the essence of the very real code wars. According to a well-worn story, when the Socceroos were eliminated from World Cup qualifying (before they eventually broke through in 2006), AFL executives would open a bottle of champagne. The AFL has always denied this. But there was palpable relief at AFL headquarters that the game they saw as their greatest potential rival did not get the reputational boost of a World Cup campaign.   Similarly there is a strong belief the inception of the AFLW was accelerated not because AFL executives had a sudden realisation of the pent-up demand for female participation, but because they coveted football's large pool of young female participants. This is not to vilify the AFL for its commercial aggression. On the contrary, the league has attained its strong position through brilliant lobbying, excellent strategic planning and hard-headed business practice. NRL executives would often lament the AFL's domination of government funding for stadiums and other projects citing all sorts of anti-league conspiracy theories.   But it was the relatively disorganised and hopelessly factionalised NRL's failure to replicate the AFL's intensive lobbying at all levels of government that left the southern game in such a powerful position. Consequently it will be intriguing to see how much weight the current platitudes about ""working together"" and a ""collegial approach"" carry when sport resumes in what will be an even more competitive economic environment. Will these unusual bedfellows share the doona or are we about to see one almighty pillow fight?    ",By Offsiders columnist Richard Hinds,"April 03, 2020"
12,/news/2020-03-31/jobkeeper-to-pay-nrl-afl-wages-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/12101754?section=sport,Wages of NRL and AFL players set to be paid by taxpayer thanks to JobKeeper scheme,"The Government's proposed JobKeeper payment is set to move the goalposts in desperate negotiations between sporting codes and their players amid the coronavirus pandemic.   Under the $130 billion measure, announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday, $750 per week, per employee, will be paid to businesses affected by the coronavirus downturn so they can in turn pay each of their staff. It is designed to keep workers employed as the economy suffers through the shutdown, but it also looms as a major bargaining chip in crisis talks underway across sporting codes. The NRL, like other sports, will lose millions in ticket sales and broadcast revenue if the coronavirus shutdown continues, and some have speculated it may lead to bankruptcy for some clubs.   In the wake of the JobKeeper announcement, the Rugby League Players Association is updating the financial modelling it is using as it thrashes out a deal with the National Rugby League on a pay cut for players to help the code endure the crisis. ""We are currently reviewing the recent Government announcement regarding subsidies, specifically what our members may be entitled to, and factoring that into our overall payment model,"" a spokesperson said.   Details of JobKeeper are still emerging, but the ABC has confirmed with the Government that professional athletes will be eligible, potentially saving clubs and governing bodies millions of dollars they would have otherwise paid players. While the proposal still needs to pass Parliament, in its current form it means about $400,000 could be injected into the NRL every week across the 16 clubs. It is also available for six months, meaning close to $10 million could end up passing from the Government to the NRL to prop up the game. That amount is broadly equivalent to one club's entire salary cap for the season and as much as one quarter of the reported value of the rescue package proposed by the Rugby League Commission. JobSeeker payments will also be made available to coaches and administrative staff who have been stood down, meaning they could be called back and have their jobs sustained in football by the Government handout. Last week the AFL Players Association struck a deal with the AFL for players to take a pay cut of 50 per cent to the end of May and more if postponements continued. But the new JobKeeper announcement could draw them back to the negotiating table.   With more teams and more players per list than the NRL, the AFL stands to gain even more than the NRL from the JobKeeper announcement — as much as $13 million. The deal last week included the cancellation of more than $8 million in payments to player injury, hardship, wellbeing and other funds managed by the players association. The AFL Players Association already intended to work with the AFL on coronavirus-prompted changes to its bargaining agreement, which was due to expire at the end of 2022.   ""While the current CBA (collective bargaining agreement) doesn't expire until the end of 2022, the AFLPA and AFL will work through the implications of COVID-19 on the remaining two years of the deal once we have a greater understanding of the financial impact,"" a spokesperson said. A-League players stood down by clubs such as Perth Glory and Central Coast Mariners may also be eligible for the payment. John Didulica, chief executive of Professional Footballers Australia, said based on information released so far players would be entitled to JobKeeper payments, which was ""fantastic news"". It is not clear whether A-League players becoming free agents over the off-season — close to half the workforce — could also benefit. ""One of the challenges is the players, or the employees, must be in continuous employment for a further six months,"" Mr Didulica said. ""In the case of the A-League, all contracts conclude on the 31st of May each year, so if any player doesn't have a contract for next season, they may well be precluded."" Hans Westerbeek, professor of international sport business at Victoria University, said the coronavirus downturn would affect second-tier sports more than the AFL or NRL, bringing down revenue and forcing players onto cheaper arrangements. And he added women's leagues — although booming recently — would suffer more than their male counterparts. ""I do think that those relatively young, immature businesses will suffer most because that's where you immediately cut your costs,"" he said. ""You reinvest your excess resources in bringing up to speed your cash cows — the businesses that are very mature and have a guaranteed return on investment — before you then start reinvesting in your emerging and newly developing businesses."" Paul Smith, owner of the basketball club Sydney Kings through his company Total Sport and Entertainment, said all sports would have to revisit their bargaining arrangements in coming years. ""There'll be a lot of interesting times in the next CBA negotiations — for all the sports — including whether a league even exists."" In the NBL, he said player salaries don't have room to fall if the downturn was prolonged. ""How do I look at a guy on $55,000 per year, you're a minimum player for us and, by the way, next year you're going to get 50 per cent of that, so you're going to get $25,000 to play for us?

13,/news/2020-03-31/motorsport-engineers-design-coronavirus-medical-equipment/12105838?section=sport,Supercars team Erebus Motorsport designs equipment to aid fight against coronavirus,"It was an idea that came to motorsport engineer Mirko De Rosa while he was watching the latest news coming out of the coronavirus-stricken city of Milan, in Italy.   De Rosa, who has family in isolation in the region, thought there had to be a way to use his team's garage, engineering skills and resources to somehow support the medical response to the pandemic. With the Supercars season currently in hiatus, like the rest of Australian sport, De Rosa decided to approach team management with his thoughts on what could be done in his team's downtime. Less than a week later, his team Erebus Motorsport is shipping its first products to medical health professionals for testing. ""We thought, yeah, let's give it a crack,"" Erebus Motorsport chief executive Barry Ryan said. ""We are not trying to save the world. We are just trying to have some options there.""   The team has been liaising with Carl Le, a doctor at Supercars headquarters, to refine its medical products and help fill an unmet demand for equipment to protect medical staff from the virus. The team has developed two prototypes; a face mask that has been adapted from its original use as a snorkel, and a perspex patient cover to stop others being exposed to coronavirus in hospitals.   ""[Dr Carl] suggested to use the mask for the healthcare staff,"" De Rosa explained.  Some Supercars teams are now mobilising to support the manufacturing process and others are experimenting with their own approach to supporting the medical response to COVID-19. Australian team Triple Eight Race Engineering has developed a ventilator ready for testing.   Supercars chief executive Sean Seamer said his sport's response to the coronavirus pandemic had been uplifting. ""They have done an amazing job to work with Dr Carl, who is also the Supercars doctor, to understand what the problem is and how they might be able to help,"" he said. Supercars said it was now encouraging other teams to support them on the Erebus Motorsport project.   ""For them if they have the capacity, if they have the talent and the hardware to support, they should jump in and give them a hand because everybody needs good news right now,"" Seamer said. At Erebus Motorsport, Ryan also paid tribute to team owner Betty Klimenko, saying her commitment to fund the experimental research gave the team every chance of success. ""We would like to thank Betty because without her this project would not be possible,"" Ryan said. Dr Le said there has been extensive collaboration already between Supercars and Erebus Motorsport, which had helped improve both products.   In the case of the e-Aerosol Box, which is a perspex cover which sits above patients, Dr Carl combined some of his own knowledge of hospital wards into the design. ""When Barry made the first one, I saw there was an opportunity to add some suction into the box, on the walls behind patients, and what we have done is drilled a hole,"" he said. ""We can connect that straight into the wall suction."" This is designed to stop the virus being transmitted by an airborne route, which can often be the case when medical staff are in vulnerable positions administering respirators or breathing aids.   The Australian motorsport scene not the only one chipping in.   In Europe, Formula 1 team Mercedes has also used its engineers and resources to develop medical equipment for the fight against coronavirus. In conjunction with London University, as well as leading clinicians, Mercedes has built a special breathing aid which has since been approved by the UK's National Health Service. It helps some coronavirus patients maintain their oxygen level, without them necessarily needing to have tubes or other devices inserted into their skin or mouths to survive. Seamer said many motorsport engineers around the world would be thinking about how they could get involved because it was the way they worked in garages and teams. ""It's like a broken car or any other engineering problem,"" he said. ""They see a problem and they have a need to fix it.""   Fittingly, automotive parts distribution business CoolDrive is helping Erebus Motorsport ship its first a-Aerosol boxes to medical facilities in Ballarat, Hobart and Adelaide from today. Two of the mask prototypes are going to Supercars medical staff for review.

The solid viewing numbers for classic footy matches replayed on various TV networks, YouTube clips of great sporting moments and online blogs of virtual games provide some indication the cravings of sport-deprived fans are strong. But there is one scenario no doubt playing on sports officials minds: What if the fans whose viewing habits have subsidised the enormous growth in professional sports spending don't return to the grandstands or to their screens in the same numbers as before?   As any first-year business student can tell you, allowing a customer to flirt with alternatives is fraught with danger. And as the isolation continues, surely there is at least some possibility we will find that — contrary to long-held belief — there is more to life than sport. Who knows, maybe those quiet socially-isolated weekend walks with family are proving a palatable alternative to the anxiety of a close finish in a packed stadium made almost intolerable by the ear-splitting noise of fan engagement. But even if our appetite for sport remains voracious the cost of attendance has risen sharply over the years for families who might now consider club membership a discretionary item rather than a necessity. As we've observed previously, AFL clubs particularly have come perilously close to shaming supporters into purchasing membership over the past 25 years with campaigns that created the underlying assumption that ""You are not a real supporter if you are not a member"".   The subsequent upselling of reserved seats and various gold and platinum packages that guaranteed AFL grand final tickets if your club fielded one of the two out of 18 teams to make it have provided a substantial revenue stream. Most sports can argue they have provided decent value for money in comparison with other forms of live entertainment (unless you include stadium food prices) such as concerts and theatre.   But how many members will now opt for a cheaper general admission ticket or even prefer to stay and watch at home? This second option could benefit the media rights-holders who enjoyed a very brief surge in audiences during the fan-free games that preceded the postponement of the AFL and NRL. But the absence of live sport now has, according to The Guardian, prompted significant cancellation of Foxtel and Kayo Sports subscriptions putting a business already challenged by rival streaming services under enormous pressure. How many in a depressed economy will immediately resume their once standard every-game viewing habits and again take up the pay-per-view subscriptions that, in turn, provide a significant portion of sports cashflow? In safeguarding this revenue model the clubs have a big role to play in maintaining a strong relationship with members even as they remain in competitive limbo.   This requires a delicate balance in which signalling their own financial distress must be tempered with an appreciation of the struggles many fans are enduring. The most awkward task for clubs now ""reaching out"" is acknowledging the right to discounts or refunds on current memberships, while hoping to retain as much pre-paid cash as possible — even if a severely truncated or abandoned season means most non-redeemed memberships will be virtual donations. None of the correspondence I have seen from clubs to members explicitly mentions refunds, although one declared it was ""mindful of how challenging it is, or might be, for you to uphold your commitment"". If sports clubs are to retain the same level of membership, how they project themselves as a good citizen while others are being compelled to take painful cuts or close businesses could have a significant impact on goodwill.   The public negotiations between various leagues and players' associations over pay cuts — and, in the NRL's case, between the league and the clubs themselves — were, at the very least, unfortunate. The last thing sport needs as it tries to maintain the passion of people suffering severe cuts to their livelihoods is the impression that ""well-paid athletes"" are not prepared to share the pain. Cricket Australia was wise to postpone the announcement of player contracts, whether this was due to uncertainty about future revenue or because revealing which players would earn seven-figure pay cheques was not a good look in the current climate. With thousands of fit young professional athletes locked up for an extended period, athlete behaviour will also play some part in shaping public opinion on whether sport has ""done its bit"".    Without games to cover, those sections of the sports media that thrive on controversy and scandal will have an even more voracious appetite for player misbehaviour stories. All this means your club will be desperate to let you know how much it needs you. One of the greatest questions to be answered on the other side of this unprecedented pause is how much, in dollars and cents terms, you still need them.

15,/news/2020-03-30/renee-had-years-work-sports-industry-ready-lost-it-coronavirus/12091952?section=sport,"Renee had a year's work in the sports industry lined up, then coronavirus meant she lost it all in a day","By her own admission, Renee Gartner is still struggling to come to terms with the situation. The boxer, mental health advocate, on-ground announcer, corporate emcee and popular brand ambassador has been left with no choice but to turn to Centrelink due to the sports industry shutting down in response to the coronavirus pandemic.   ""Stressed would probably be the one word I would use,"" she said. ""I am quite scared of how the times are."" It is a surreal predicament that many sports industry freelancers like Gartner are now facing, after suddenly losing their income. ""When we first heard that the crowds were going to get locked out, that was when I knew I would probably lose three-quarters of my work,"" she said. In March, coronavirus wreaked havoc on Gartner's work schedule, with tens of thousands of dollars of work lost in one day alone due to cancellations by various clubs and event organisers.   ""I am an emcee for South Sydney so obviously as soon as the NRL closed the gates for fans that meant there was no formal functions that were happening there,"" she said. ""For the [Sydney] Swans, I do their ground announcing. ""I was going to be commentating at the Aussies [Australian Surf Championships] and then they announced they had to cancel. ""Then the Autumn Carnival for the ATC [Australian Turf Club]. ""It was just bang, bang, bang — one thing after another."" Even boxing or fitness coaching is not currently an option, given the current social-distancing restrictions. ""I have put my hand up to do labour, to drive or to make coffee,"" she said.   ""I would like to think I am pretty employable across many realms, but unfortunately the jobs aren't there at the moment."" Not being employed fulltime has left Gartner in a precarious financial position and she is calling on the Government to provide more support for her and others like her. ""The majority of the people that are in a similar position like me are freelancers or sole traders and at the moment we don't ... get any help,"" she said. ""It's so widespread and we're all unemployed. It is heartbreaking."" Gartner, who has had experience dealing with her own mental health challenges in the past, has warned many people will be doing it tough because of a sudden loss of work. She said it was critical those in a bad place reached out to others. ""I implore people to just get out there and chat,"" she said. ""It is OK not to be OK.""     According to the 2019 Ibis World report, the Australian sports industry has grown substantially over the past five years, mainly thanks to television rights broadcast revenue. One pertinent example of the value of sports rights came in 2017, when the AFL signed a record $2.5 billion deal over six years between Channel Seven, Telstra and Foxtel. Now, with the entire industry on hold, experts are warning it might never be the same again.   Former Soccer Australia CEO, businessman and sports administrator David Hill says the Australian sports industry, which employs about 70,000 people, is in crisis. ""All of them have contracts to spend money that they are not going to get,"" he said. ""Both of them [the AFL and NRL] get nearly $10 million for a weekend's round of football from the television coverage, and they are not playing now, so they can't receive that. ""That means the end of the big source of money."" Compounding the problem for Australian sport is the broadcast businesses that have traditionally provided their primary source of revenue are themselves on the verge of collapse. ""I can't see Fox Sports surviving,"" Hill said. Australia's traditional free-to-air broadcasters, which have also contributed to the growth of sport in the past decade, are also under intense pressure. Seven West Media, which purchased the rights to the Olympic Games, has been hit hard by drops in advertising revenue and the migration of many consumers to streaming platforms.   Hill believes Australian sport had already reached its financial peak before the virus hit.   ""There is going to be a big cut all the way down the chain,"" he said. ""There will be a big drop in the amount of money that is flowing through the sporting organisations."" As traditional broadcast partners struggle, wagering companies could become more of an option for Australian sports. Tabcorp recently acquired the rights to show NBA and NFL matches on its Sky Sports channels. Media analyst Peter Cox says sports might soon also be broadcasting more of their own content and looking more at a direct-to-consumer approach. The big three in the US — the NBA, MLB and NFL — all offer online access to games for fans.  ""The sports are breaking up into smaller groups now,"" Cox said. ""The niche sports have got their own followings. They are taking the young people."" Gartner said she was expecting a downturn but would still look to pursue work in the sports industry once things turned around. ""I think times are definitely going to be tougher for sport in Australia, but it's our entertainment,"" she said.    ",By Patrick Galloway,"March 30, 2020"
16,/news/2020-03-29/sport-post-coronavirus/12099598?section=sport,"Shrunken leagues, virtual Olympics and simulated crowds: What sport might look like post-coronavirus","Barely a couple of weeks into the coronavirus shutdown and the sporting world is already on its knees. Things thought impossible just one month ago are the sober reality. The AFL has stood down staff, with players agreeing to a pay cut until May. The NRL will try to sell players its own rescue package on Monday.  And that's only the beginning. The sports stoppage could go on for months. Rugby league great Andrew Johns has already envisaged the virus shaving the NRL competition from 16 teams to 12. But that could be just one small part of a radical period of sporting reform. Liam Lenten, a sports economist from LaTrobe University, has looked back at how events like World War I (1914-1918) and the outbreak of Spanish Influenza (1918) affected the world of sport. But the effects of that period, such as abbreviated VFL seasons and the cancellation of the 1916 Berlin Olympics, have already been matched by the current outbreak.   Players may never finish the 2020 AFL season, and the Tokyo Olympics has already been postponed to next year. This time around, he believes clubs might seek to have outcomes of competitions that were close to completion confirmed through legal action. That means a club like Liverpool in the English Premier League might seek to have its trophy awarded in court. ""With no titles being awarded in some competitions, legal action might be threatened,"" he said. ""Liverpool almost, but not quite mathematically, had the title sewn up.""   Paul Hayes QC, a Victorian barrister and editor of the Australian and New Zealand Sports Law Journal, might be in a better position than most to benefit from a wave of litigation. But he's more interested in the growth of interest in, and acceptance of, esports. The shutdown of other sports, he anticipates, could mean a flood of interest in virtual competitions as broadcasters, hungry for content, turn to gaming. ""In coming months Fox Sports and other broadcasters will need to fill airtime with compelling content,"" he said. ""There are only so many great Wallabies victories which can be repeated and put to air."" The Olympic movement's charter pursues ""the qualities of body, will and mind"". That's a long way from the traditional image of the gamer: seated for hours at a time, disconnected from the physical world bar the kick of energy drinks. But reality has quickly overtaken stereotype. Formula 1 is planning virtual races to replace postponed events this year, and the involvement of professional drivers delivers legitimacy to this competition. ""The esports and gaming scene is already booming among enthusiasts around the world and is now big business, especially in South-East Asia, but this increased exposure is likely to drive its acceptance more broadly,"" Mr Hayes said.   The silk, who has represented Olympic athletes including cyclist Mark French and swimmer Nick D'Arcy, believes the skills of their virtual counterparts could win over the sceptics ... and the International Olympic Committee. IOC president Thomas Bach has already flagged esports becoming part of the Olympic program in the future. ""It will be too soon to replace Tokyo with a 2020 esports Games,"" Mr Hayes said, ""but the interest generated this year will mean it won't be long until esports, much like non-traditional Olympic sports such as surfing, is brought under the IOC banner."" While he's enthusiastic about the likelihood of virtual racers and FIFA players competing for medals, Mr Hayes believes even the IOC has its limits. ""Don't expect Grand Theft Auto."" Major codes such as the NRL and AFL have historically been reliant on broadcast deals for the lion's share of revenue. No games to play means no TV dollars, exposing the financial ill-health of clubs and administrative bodies. Many players will have already signed the richest deal of their careers.   Sarah Kelly, an associate professor in marketing and law specialising in sport at the University of Queensland, said sport was being forced to evolve rapidly, and its business models may be overhauled. ""These include cost reductions in professional sports, possibly revised ownership and investment and rapid innovation to develop new revenue streams and growth opportunities."" Mat Jessep, founder of Game Legal and Consulting, anticipates an ""overdue"" age of financial integrity. He foresees enhanced governance requirements, greater oversight from bodies such as Sport Australia and more private and fan ownership models in leagues and teams. That may threaten the norm of sporting codes being structured as not-for-profits run by boards with limited business experience. ""We've seen few sports actually ensure profits are made, and fewer investing any profits into sustainability measures,"" he said. ""Sport can't just shrug this off and go back to the good old days. ""Professional sport has to get better at business, or get less professional at sport."" He flagged more clubs being kicked out of competitions due to poor financial performance, and even radical restructures where for-profit holding companies would run executive and commercial functions, while not-for-profit subsidiaries run sport operations. ""Fans may see sports retract in size or clubs and teams even relocate as finances are managed better,"" he warned. ""However, in the long term, fans could expect greater stability in the competitions they follow and support, as well as better integrity in their sports as healthier commercial outcomes are invested back into pro sports.""   As sport itself re-emerges from the shutdown, it's likely to resemble the most recent rounds of the AFL and NRL: matches played in front of empty stands. But the jarring lack of atmosphere may be a thing of the past. Adam Hodge, head of strategy and planning for sports marketing firm Octagon in the Asia-Pacific, said the complete absence of crowd noise made it hard to watch. ""Without the roars, rumbles, screams and sighs coming out of our speakers, the edge was taken off the game for at-home fans,"" he said. Mr Hodge believes augmented reality is a realistic option to make the return of sport more like the experience fans remember. ""What if we take the pre-recorded crowd sounds from the video game versions of the sports and then map these against the live game action? ""So as a player streaks across the field towards a try or goal on live TV, the system triggers the game crowd sounds to help our ears match what our eyes are seeing."" If it was to happen, Mr Hodge anticipated a period of complaints similar to that which follows the introduction of things like interchange rules, non-traditional jersey styles, new camera angles and original on-screen graphics. But he notes that augmented reality is already used in other entertainment, such as auto-tune in live music, and ultimately fans may come to appreciate the approach.  ""Sometimes these changes are evolutions made over many years of small tweaks. ""And then other times these changes come in the form of a revolution where extraordinary circumstance call for immediate change."" Long after coronavirus has come and gone, artificial crowd noise might even work at a Suns versus Giants clash on a rainy Saturday afternoon. ""Either way, the fan will always have the final say.""      ",By Jack Snape,"March 29, 2020"

31,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-community-sport-clubs-feeling-impact-of-pandemic/12137910?section=sport,Community sporting clubs will feel the pinch as coronavirus pandemic hits grassroots levels,"At the historic oval near my inner-suburban home, the customary seasonal transition is in eerie abeyance. The turf wicket would by now usually have been pockmarked by the boots of stampeding footballers and the goal posts erected. Instead, the thin white posts remain in their storage pods near the cricket nets, while the turf square is sprouting autumnal grass, protected by high-tech security (a flimsy rope and two small ""keep off"" signs). Workmen continue to install a new scoreboard that will display the achievements of suburban champs. But no one knows whether its luminous digits will first record goals and behinds, or runs and wickets. The scene is no doubt similar at most country and suburban grounds, the sporting and social hubs of communities that now instead host determinedly sombre socially distanced workouts.   Inevitably the media focus on the impact of the deadly coronavirus pandemic on sport has highlighted the deprivation of AFL and NRL matches and the sundry costs and contingencies.   Most recently we have been confronted by anxious administrators trying to stave off financial ruin by concocting ever more desperate measures to get players back on the field, even if playing on islands or in clusters would risk creating the potentially ruinous air of ""normality"" our political leaders have rightly suppressed.   Amid the huffing of these panic-stricken sporting bureaucrats and the unseemly haggling over the percentages to be cut from vast playing contracts, there has been a consoling thought.   Sport is not imperilled by the financial knock-ons from this deadly pandemic because sport is not merely what we see on the TV or in a packed stadium. Sport at its most basic is a kid with a bat and ball or a racquet or just a pair of runners, regardless of where the evolution of various games through codification, professionalism, mass audience appeal and ""elite performance"" has taken them. But even viewed through the rosiest lens, this does not mean the suburban warriors of community sport are immune from the havoc coronavirus has wrought at the professional levels. When various national governing bodies tightened their stranglehold on the grassroots — in some cases for the greater good — sport became, even more so, a trickle-down economy. So the loss of overall revenue generated through media rights, sponsorship and gate receipts will have a profound impact on how much support will be provided to suburban leagues and clubs. Consequently, the likely sporting depression will provide a test of the priorities and the commitment of administrators to the most important level of sport — the community base that props up the sporting pyramid. Funding for the loss-making women's professional leagues currently driving mass participation will provide a similar insight into their long-term vision.   At local level a flattened economy will have an immediate impact on community clubs that typically rely on sponsorship from the kind of small businesses — such as pubs, restaurants and real estate agents — that have taken the biggest financial hits. The explosion in entry-level and early-age junior participation has also created a steady stream of revenue for many clubs and, in some cases, a heavy reliance on junior memberships to fund overall operations. Will parents hard hit by the depressed economy continue to pay? Will kids return after a gap season in which they have formed an even greater bond with — you might say addiction to —their PlayStations and iPhones? Will senior players who already struggled to come up with their subs — or even be able to pay them — return? Most pertinently, will the governing bodies enjoying a generational benefit from the current participation boom fund their own form of stimulus package to help clubs ensure the now cash-strapped and disadvantaged can still play? Football, particularly, has a bottom-to-top financial model that has imposed sometimes outlandish fees on juniors used to prop up senior teams and even Football Federation Australia itself. This was a controversial topic before the pandemic and could now be — as much as the future of the A-League and W-League — a major source of vulnerability for the sport's continued growth.   Another key funding question for community clubs is whether government grants for infrastructure promised (and in some cases misappropriated) before the pandemic struck can still be delivered given the billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to wage relief and other emergency initiatives. The provision of female change rooms has been a key focus of government grants, given the enormous growth in girl's and women's cricket, football and Australian rules particularly. The best hope might be that grants can still be justified in order to provide stimulus for the building industry. Inevitably even the most prosperous local clubs will find themselves asking similar questions to their professional counterparts: Do they need to pay as much for that half-back or recruit the ex-first grade batsman who might have helped win a premiership?   This might not be such a bad thing for those clubs who have been caught up in the inflated premiership-chasing cash-in-hand economy that distorts the raison d'etre of some even supposedly ""amateur"" clubs. But during the hiatus it is the simple absence of the gathering of weekend tribes that will be felt most, particularly in those country towns where the people you see at the footy on Saturday afternoon might be the only ones you see all week. For now, the new scoreboard near my house merely creates an impatience for the days when its numbers will, like the faces in front of the old grandstand, light up.

32,/news/2020-04-09/online-gaming-hits-huge-numbers-during-coronavirus-pandemic/12135714?section=sport,Online gaming is getting a big boost from the coronavirus pandemic — and experts say it's just the beginning,"Even before the coronavirus pandemic, most Australian parents would agree that online gaming was a lot more than just a growing trend.   Already a hundred-billion-dollar global industry, online gaming has become a popular pastime for many, and even a full-blown profession for some. Dedicated esports arenas, huge tournaments and the migration of traditional sport into the virtual world in recent years have proven it was already here to stay. But off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, the proliferation of online gaming in households is predicted to go to the next level. James Birt, Associate Professor in Information and Computing Science at Bond University, has studied emerging technology for the past 20 years and says he is seeing record-breaking levels of participation.   Some game manufacturers across the world have reported downloads have more than doubled, while a staggering 1.2 billion hours of content was consumed on the streaming platform Twitch in March. ""The number of people playing games is off the charts, we have never seen this many players streaming and playing simultaneously online, in the history of gaming,"" Associate Professor Birt said. Earlier this week, Twitch reported it had more than 4 million concurrent viewers on its platform for the first time, after the release of Valorant, by Riot Games. ""I think what COVID-19 has really created is this point in time that one could say, is when this movement happened,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""Kids, esports enthusiasts, just [the] general public are getting into games in a way that they have never done in history. ""What we see now is those people that hadn't engaged in esports and gaming prior to the pandemic are now driving in droves towards new opportunities new experiences, new collaborative opportunities with friends.""     Motorsport is one of a number of Australian sports well placed during the downtime to take advantage of the booming interest and willingness of fans to watch online games. The inaugural All Stars Eseries event took place on Wednesday night and saw drivers competing remotely against each other online, in the first of 10 rounds. It was broadcast live on Fox Sports and streamed across multiple social platforms.   The competition followed the script from recent years in Supercars, with 2018 and 2019 series champion Scott McLaughlin winning two of the three races. The first two races featured the Phillip Island virtual circuit, while the final race was held using a digital version of the famous Monza track, home of the Italian Formula One grand prix. Like almost all of Australian sport, the traditional Supercars series — in which drivers and teams compete on tracks around the country — is on hold because of the pandemic. Instead, simulators have been installed in the homes of 25 drivers, who are getting used to the idea of getting suited up and racing the competition from the comfort of their own living space.   Holden driver Chaz Mostert has welcomed the initiative. ""Supercars has done all that it can to set this up so we can at least keep the fans entertained at home … I'm sure it's killing people like myself who wish we were racing, on the track, but we're making do with what we can at the moment,"" he said. ""It's a bit different, strolling down the stairs and going into the garage [to the simulator], it's a bit more unique than getting on a plane and going to a round!"" Similar moves are taking place in the United States, where NBA players have been pitted against each other in a special NBA 2K tournament, set to broadcast on ESPN. It is an example of how esports can also showcase sports stars in a unique way, by cutting to player reactions and banter over a mix of gameplay. Associate Professor Birt says many sports should be looking to take advantage of the unique opportunities that online gaming presents, given sports entertainment can now easily cross digital borders. ""The increase in the power behind the computing and the capacity to present the materials in 4K, we really are moving towards photo-realism in our games,"" he said. ""We are going to see even more dramatic increases this year with the release of things like the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox [Series X],"" he said.   Mostert himself has been blown away by the quality of the visuals in his gaming experience, and said he was interested in being able to see the races on replay to get a different perspective from the simulator. ""I think we [drivers] are like fans, we're still going to be watching [the replay] tomorrow, even though the race happened today,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to having good on-track battles as well, it's still the same competition that we're used to out in the real world, and no doubt we'll still be racing for sheep stations in the virtual world as well."" With traditional sport still in a pandemic-induced hiatus, esports is expected to further develop its role in the Australian sporting landscape in the months ahead. ""I think there is this incredible blend between the technical capacity of esports to essentially get into people's living rooms,"" Associate Professor Birt said. ""What television hasn't been able to do is create that connection between players, the games and the brands.""    ",By Patrick Galloway,"April 09, 2020"
33,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-nrl-set-to-resume-2020-season-on-may-28/12136700?section=sport,NRL plans for May 28 return amid coronavirus as Nine Network accuses league of 'mismanagement',"The NRL is planning to restart its season on May 28 amid the coronavirus pandemic, while it has been accused by the Nine Network of financial ""mismanagement"" and breaking its lucrative broadcast deal.   The ARL Commission (ARLC) made the announcement about wanting the premiership season to resume late next month following a meeting with the NRL's innovations committee on Thursday. The decision was announced after Nine released a statement on Thursday morning taking aim at the NRL's financial management, which it claimed had left clubs and players facing uncertain futures. ""The [coronavirus] situation is changing dramatically and we need to get moving,"" ARLC chairman Peter V'landys said. ""It is in the best interests of our clubs, our players, our stakeholders and importantly our fans that the competition resumes as quickly and as safely as possible. ""We have said right from the start that what we say today may need to change tomorrow. ""We will be flexible, and if the trend changes or if government restrictions change then so will we. The health and safety of our players and the general public remains the absolute priority.""   The ARLC endorsed the grand final being played as a standalone fixture in Sydney and State of Origin remaining in a three-match format this season. There is also a preference towards completing the remaining rounds of a regular NRL season rather than playing in conferences.   ""What we're leaning towards is a competition structure that looks more aligned with what we're currently got,"" ARL commissioner Wayne Pearce said. ""We've currently got support from the New South Wales Government in terms of if we adhere to public health guidelines and we make sure that our players follow those guidelines, we are able to train and play. ""Provided that we have strict measures around testing of players, and put some other protocols in place that allow us to minimise the risk of infection within the playing group and community."" Pearce, who headed up the NRL's innovations committee, said the league had not worked out when the season would be completed. ""That's the piece of work we need to do that's subject to a number of variables, one of which is government regulations,"" he said. ""If they're stringent and players aren't able to go back to their home environment that makes it difficult to expect them to be away from their kids for a long period of time. ""I think there's a lot of positives with the competition up and running again. The players, staff at clubs, services to clubs that will benefit. ""There's a lot of people that will be happy with the decision to get the competition running again."" The NRL season was suspended after two rounds last month because of coronavirus fears, with the league having made the decision a day after the AFL announced it was shutting down its competition. Nine said it had been left out of discussions on what the NRL season should look like if it resumed in the coming months. ""At Nine we had hoped to work with the NRL on a solution to the issues facing rugby league in 2020, brought on so starkly by COVID-19,"" the Nine Network statement read. ""But this health crisis in our community has highlighted the mismanagement of the code over many years.""   Nine said it had provided the NRL with a substantial financial investment during its tenure as the competition's free-to-air broadcaster. ""Nine has invested hundreds of millions in this game over decades and we now find they have profoundly wasted those funds with very little to fall back on to support the clubs, the players and supporters,"" the statement read. ""In the past the NRL have had problems and we've bailed them out many times, including a $50 million loan to support clubs when the last contract was signed. ""It would now appear that much of that has been squandered by a bloated head office completely ignoring the needs of the clubs, players and supporters. ""We now find ourselves with a contract that is unfulfilled by the code. We hoped we could talk through a long-term plan.""   Pearce said the ARL Commission wanted to continue working with the Nine Network. ""They're a key partner for us and we intend to fulfil our contractual obligations,"" he said. ""We hope to maintain a working relationship that will work for both parties."" Nine's statement came after weeks of speculation surrounding the future of current NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg. Greenberg is currently in the final year of his contract.     AAP/ABC",,"April 09, 2020"
34,/news/2020-04-09/golf-keeps-aussies-on-course-during-covid19/12119570?section=sport,Golf a 'reason to get up in the morning' and keeping Aussies on course amid coronavirus,"The coronavirus outbreak has brought most sport to a standstill, but one game is giving some Australians respite from the ongoing uncertainty.   Despite increasing efforts to limit life outside the home, golf has been allowed to continue in most states — as long as clubs adopt strict conditions in keeping their courses open. The move has been praised by players and medical experts concerned about the potential health risks of social restrictions on older people.   Sydney resident John Parker has been playing at Marrickville Golf Club for 40 years and he has never experienced conditions like those under COVID-19. Players are restricted to groups of two and must keep 1.5 metres apart at all times. Carts cannot be shared, hand sanitiser is freely available, and the clubhouse is closed. Despite the extreme measures, the retiree is thrilled to be out in the fresh air. ""I just love it, it's a reason to get up early in the morning,"" he said. Golf is one of his last remaining social activities.  He is unable to visit his grandchildren and his outings to the theatre stopped weeks ago.     ""[Coronavirus restrictions] have had a big impact on my wife and I,"" he said. ""We always went out on a Tuesday night and that's no longer possible. ""Not being able to see the grandchildren has been one of the biggest impacts, but we talk to them everyday on the phone.""   He said the potential of losing golf would be a difficult blow to many people. ""The elderly and retired generation really look forward to it and it's devastating if they can't play,"" he said. For fellow golfer Peter Harrison the game has been a respite from the uncertainty of the world around him. ""It's definitely a release,"" he said. ""Once you're on the course you switch off from everything else and that just brings you back to where you used to be."" While most health experts agree that self-isolating is a top priority, researchers are also concerned about the consequences of residents remaining inactive.     Australians suffer from high rates of cardiovascular disease, with factors like being overweight or obese contributing to around 119 deaths from the chronic illness every day. Dr Erin Howden from the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute said scientists know how quickly the body can deteriorate due to inactivity thanks to the Dallas Bed Rest study. In 1966, five men young men were confined to bed for three weeks, causing their cardiovascular health to plummet.   Researchers, including Dr Howden, tracked down these participants 30 years later and found that the weeks of bed rest were more damaging to their bodies than decades of ageing. She said the research highlights the importance of keeping active during this pandemic. ""We are very concerned about the effects of COVID-19 and how this might impact individuals' cardiovascular health,"" she said. ""Golf is one of the lucky sports at the moment allowing people to get out. ""It's really important to avoid being sedentary as much as possible … so I think it's a great activity."" But keeping the courses open has been a balancing act for clubs, according to Marrickville Golf Club president Andrew Tighe. ""We're trying to do our best to be responsible to the community and to our members, however we are also keen to keep to the course open if we can,"" he said. ""We are constantly monitoring the news and we are being very diligent to comply with every directive the government gives.""     Despite some initial confusion and inconsistencies across the country, golf can go ahead in most states except for Victoria and the Northern Territory. Golf NSW spokesman Graeme Phillipson said it is a challenge every club has had to face. ""There are individual clubs that have chosen to close and that's their individual decision,"" he said. ""While the NSW Government is allowing people to play golf we are encouraging clubs to do so [stay open]."" With the coronavirus restrictions expected to last for months ahead, Mr Parker said he is determined to make the most of his favourite outdoor exercise. ""As long as I'm capable of playing and we're allowed to play I will still play,"" he said.    ",ABC Radio Sydney      By                                 Matt Bamford,"April 09, 2020"
35,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-pandemic-will-change-afl-in-the-future/12131660?section=sport,AFL to be played in 'very different landscape' after coronavirus pandemic,"The game of Australian Rules football has changed constantly over its 160-odd-year history. Laws have been tweaked and tactics have evolved.   Even the shape of the field and ball are different to what they once were. The sport now appears headed into another period of upheaval — one brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and the financial havoc it has wrought. Thoughts are turning to what the football world will look like on and off the field with a drastically reduced budget thanks to the slashing of income through TV money, gate takings and other commercial opportunities. ""It is no doubt going to be a very different landscape,"" St Kilda's head of football program David Rath said.   ""We're still waiting to hear from the AFL what those constraints are. ""But even then, I think what we'll find is going to be a new world."" If one thing is certain, it is that clubs will be forced to cut their off-field football spending.     It is an area that had become bloated, according to some critics, with a myriad of assistants, development coaches, sports scientists, welfare managers and analysts added to clubs' payrolls in the past two decades. To curtail that arms race, the AFL introduced what was known as a soft cap on football department spending, which was set at $9.7 million before the coronavirus shutdown. Clubs could still spend more, but were taxed for every dollar spent over the limit.  That cap will be reduced — and perhaps hardened — as the league adapts to its new financial circumstances.   ""All clubs will have to be much more frugal in how they're spending money,"" Rath said. ""I don't think anyone will be in a position to be splashing out to gain a massive advantage."" Four-time premiership coach David Parkin believes a cut in non-playing football staff may prove to be a fillip to a game he feels has had some of the joy sucked out of it. He cites a conversation he had with Brownlow medallist Sam Mitchell and other Hawthorn midfielders, who described to him the amount of coaching they received at Hawthorn. ""They were averaging 92 stoppages per game, and every one of those stoppages somebody had pre-determined what their starting position was and what their role was from that starting position,"" Parkin said.   ""And they were outwardly and honestly talking about how much their sheer enjoyment, the fun of playing had been reduced for them."" Parkin hopes having fewer coaches will allow footballers to play with more creativity and spontaneity. ""I think initially we might get a better game for all participants — easier to umpire, better to watch and more fun to play,"" he said.   But Rath, who was one of those coaching Mitchell at the Hawks, does not subscribe to that theory. ""I don't think it's as simple as more coaches mean more structure,"" Rath said. ""If you look at how the game's been played over the last couple of years, it's had an element of chaos that hasn't come about because there's been fewer coaches. ""There's been more coaches than five or six years ago when it was incredibly structured."" Style issues aside, there is a human face to the changes sweeping the AFL. Real people are losing real jobs.   One of them is Nathan Burke. Overnight, his full-time position as the Western Bulldogs' AFLW coach was cut to seven hours per week. ""They're [AFL clubs] probably going to have to look at their whole business model of how much do they put into their next-generation academies, their school programs and their community programs,"" Burke said. ""And they need to decide — what's our core business? Do we cut out an assistant coach or do we cut somebody from the marketing department?"".   But befitting someone who has been a pioneer of analytics and strategy in football, Rath believes the clubs and coaches who adapt fastest to the new environment will be the ones to succeed. ""It's probably the clubs that innovate quickest that get the biggest advantage in that space,"" Rath said. ""Some of what we're doing in six months' time will be different to what we're going to be doing in 18 months' time. Footy has this amazing ability to adapt."" It will have to. The golden days of clubs spending every cent that comes in and often more are gone. Footy will eventually be back, but it will not be the same.

36,/news/2020-04-08/coronavirus-roger-federer-gives-tennis-lesson-on-social-media/12133464?section=sport,Roger Federer gives social media tennis lesson while self-isolating during coronavirus pandemic,"Roger Federer has a bit of spare time on his hands at the moment, with professional tennis on hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic.   But that has not stopped the 20-time major singles champion from keeping himself busy by offering tips to his legion of fans around the world, who are also stuck at home because of self-isolation and social distancing measures. Federer took to Twitter and Instagram with a short video to showcase what he described as a ""helpful solo drill"" for all the tennis enthusiasts looking to improve their volleying skills while confined to their dwellings. He tapped the ball more than 200 times during the test of reflex and form in the 59-second video.   Federer did not stop there, however, going one step further by encouraging his followers and other social media users to reply to him with their own videos mimicking the volleying exercise he displayed so he could give some feedback.   There was some extra advice as well, with the Panama-hat wearing Federer directing users to ""choose your hat wisely"".   Within six hours, Federer's video garnered more than 1 million views, and his post drew more than 1,300 replies. Many of those replying to Federer got inventive, with two sisters teaming up to mimic a typical on-court exchange between a player and a ball kid.   ""Classic, you guys are funny,"" Federer replied. Federer also apologised to the father of one of his fans, who had interrupted a Zoom meeting by volleying against a wall at home while wearing a sombrero.   ""That was the right choice of hat, love the effort, sorry to your dad!"" wrote Federer alongside a series of smiling and laughing emojis. To another tweet, in which a man hit a tennis ball against an indoor wall while a dog appeared to nap underneath, Federer answered: ""Love the confidence not to drop the [tennis ball emoji] on the [dog emoji].""   Federer replied to a number of other tweets, often complimenting their choice of headwear and dispensing a little advice.   ""Don't lean back, strong in the wrist,"" Federer wrote to one Twitter user.  ""Keep up the great work."" Federer, who holds the record for most major singles trophies won by a male player, has previously posted clips of himself hitting against a wall in the snow, including around-the-back or through-the-leg ""tweener"" trick shots. The 38-year-old, who had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in February, is waiting — along with every other professional player — for competitive tennis to return. The men's and women's professional tours are suspended until at least mid-July because of the COVID-19 pandemic.       ABC/AP",,"April 08, 2020"
37,/news/2020-04-08/dana-white-says-ufc-island-is-on-the-cards/12131734?section=sport,UFC president Dana White says he has secured an island to hold international MMA fights,"With world sport searching for ways to get around the coronavirus pandemic, the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is talking up the possibility of holding fights on a private island.    UFC president Dana White said a fight between lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson had been scrapped, with Nurmagomedov apparently unable to leave Russia amid the pandemic. American Justin Gaethje is the new man to replace Nurmagomedov at UFC 249 at a yet-to-be-determined location. ""I'm this close to getting a deal done so this place where this fight is going to be on April 18th, I have locked up for two months. So I'm going to continue to pump fights out,"" White told ESPN.   ""I've also secured an island. I've got an island. The infrastructure is being built right now.   ""We're going to do all of our international fights on this island."" White gave no indication where the island was located. The last UFC event was on March 15 in the Brazilian capital Brasilia. It became the first event in UFC's history held behind closed doors after the Governor of the Federal District that includes Brasilia declared a ban on all large gatherings in response to coronavirus. Since then, a UFC fight night in London was also cancelled, as were two other cards due to be held at UFC's headquarters in Las Vegas. Although White still has not even announced a venue for UFC 249, he remains determined to hold the pay-per-view show. White wrote on Twitter: ""The fight is signed and is 100% ON LIVE on ESPN somewhere on EARTH!!!!"" Most US states have restrictions in place that would make it impossible to stage a show, even without an audience.     UFC 249 initially was slated for Brooklyn, but a venue change became necessary several weeks ago. ESPN, the UFC's broadcast partner, has said White was attempting to secure an unnamed venue on the west coast for the show. ""I'm terrified and I … love it,"" Gaethje tweeted after the announcement of his fight. Nurmagomedov announced last week that he wasn't planning to leave his native Dagestan, suggesting Russia's travel restrictions in response to coronavirus made it impossible. He later claimed he would be willing to leave for the fight but couldn't plan because he didn't know where or when it would occur. Australian UFC champion Alex Volkanovski said he was confident White could make the project work. ""It is crazy but if anyone is going to do it, it's Dana White,"" he said.   Volkanovski, a former concreter from New South Wales' south coast, has resumed training after recovering from a broken hand he sustained during his title-winning fight in Las Vegas last December. The 31-year-old was hoping to begin the defence of his featherweight title in Australia but said he was open to the possibility of joining the UFC island project. ""I wanted to defend that belt on home soil, but it just not looks like that's happening. I think that's definitely going to have to be postponed,"" Volkanovski said. ""Now that the coronavirus has come up, I'm thinking why we don't just go and fight on an island for a while?"" With the coronavirus pandemic set to disrupt almost all major international sporting competitions for the foreseeable future, Volkanovski said White's idea might be a silver lining for sports fans around the world. ""We could be stuck in this for a long time and if this is the only way of bringing money for me and my family, I might have to do it,"" he said. ""If it does happen, the world will be watching — especially in the times we're in right now.  ""If we can make it work, why not give it a crack?""   The island idea is not new, with the NRL admitting it is considering a range of options including moving its entire competition to Tangalooma — on Moreton Island off the Queensland coast — to keep the players quarantined. The AFL has suggested the possibility that teams could be sent to a number of ""hubs"" in different states in a bid to get the season off the ground. The idea would involve some teams based in Tasmania and Western Australia, where there are lower COVID-19 infection rates and a possible earlier end to self isolation and restrictions than elsewhere in Australia. However AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield has described the idea as ""speculative"" and said he wasn't sure how comfortable he was with it.     ABC/Wires",,"April 08, 2020"
