It bettered tracks by former winner Flume, Mallrat, Tones and I and others, including Denzel Curry's cover of the 1996 song Bulls On Parade by Rage Against The Machine, which had been considered the frontrunner. Eilish's victory is historic for two reasons: she is also, at 18, the youngest winner of the Hottest 100. A top 10 full of female solo artists — there were five — might be symbolic of a slow, subtle change happening within the Australian music business, which has long lacked gender equality. Meanwhile, Thelma Plum became the highest-ranking Indigenous artist in history when her song Better In Blak came in at number nine. And Hilltop Hoods, at number 10 this year, racked up their 20th song in a Hottest 100. Here are the top 10 songs.  WARNING: Explicit language                    ",,"January 25, 2020"
1,/news/2020-04-08/country-folk-singer-john-prine-dies-at-73-of-coronavirus-compli/12132638,Grammy-winning songwriter John Prine dies at 73 of coronavirus complications,"Grammy-winning singer John Prine, who wrote his early songs in his head while delivering mail and went on to become one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, has died due to complications from coronavirus.   He was 73. Prine's publicist confirmed the singer-songwriter died due to complications from COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Nashville. Prine was hospitalised on March 26 suffering from symptoms of COVID-19, according to his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, who was also his manager. ""We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,"" the Recording Academy, which gives out the Grammy Awards, said in a written statement. ""Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John's impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.""   Born in Chicago on October 10, 1946, Prine's older brother taught him to play guitar at the age of 14. After graduating from high school in suburban Maywood, Illinois, Prine worked as a mail carrier for five years, performing in Chicago clubs in the evenings at occasional ""open mic"" nights. He would say later that some of his best-known early songs were written while he walked the streets of Chicago delivering mail.   ""I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books,"" he told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview. ""You just had time to be quiet and think, and that's where I would come up with a lot of songs. If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down."" He was drafted into the US Army in 1966, and was stationed in Germany during the Vietnam War, before returning home to dedicate himself to music and establishing himself as a leading member of Chicago's folk revival scene. Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson fatefully saw Prine performing at the Earl of Old Town club, leading to Prine's signing with Atlantic Records and self-titled debut album, released in 1971. That album, widely praised by critics, contained several songs that would become staples of Prine's catalogue.   They included Angel from Montgomery, about a woman wishing for deliverance from her unfulfilling life, Paradise, about a Kentucky town devastated by strip mining, and Sam Stone, chronicling the downward spiral of a drug-addicted Vietnam War veteran and containing the oft-quoted refrain: ""There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes, Jesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose."" The songs have since been covered dozens of times by other artists. His early songwriting style earned comparisons with folk great Bob Dylan, who later called Prine one of his favourites. ""Prine's stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs,"" Dylan told the Huffington Post in 2009. Prine released a string of albums in the 1970s, winning larger audiences and critical acclaim as his music stretched from folk to country to Americana, often infused with a sense of humour. In the 1980s, fed up with the recording industry, he started his own label, Oh Boy Records, releasing albums under that imprint for the next several decades.   He won his first Grammy Award in 1991, Best Contemporary Folk Album, for The Missing Years. He would win a second Grammy in the same category in 2005 for Fair and Square. In December 2019, the Recording Academy honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.   Prine survived squamous cell cancer in 1998, undergoing surgery to his neck and tongue that left his voice with an even deeper, gravelly tone. In 2013, he was diagnosed with cancer in his left lung and had it removed. Prine was able to find humour in his struggle with cancer, joking that it actually improved his voice. The same humour suffused much of his work, alongside its poignant commentary about the struggles and foibles of ordinary people. ""If I can make myself laugh about something I should be crying about, that's pretty good,"" he once said. Reuters    ",,"April 08, 2020"

3,/news/2020-04-08/virtual-tour-art-cinema-theatre-dance-exhibition-gallery-comedy/12115510,"As Australian arts moves online, here is where to check out comedy, theatre, music, drag, visual art and more","In the parallel universe where coronavirus didn't happen, thousands of us are taking our seats at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival right now. Thousands more are immersing ourselves in epic installations at the Biennale of Sydney or experiencing a sensory overload at QAGOMA's Water exhibition in Brisbane. Instead, these venues and festivals — alongside hundreds more, nationwide — have shut up shop, many for the first time in their operational history. As for us, we're cooped up like barnyard hens, socially distanced and self-isolated from one another.    Still, the arts haven't gone anywhere. In fact, we rely on them perhaps more than ever. Streaming TV and movies, video games, books and music all keep us sane and entertained, providing reprieve from the rolling horror of the news.  The only thing missing is the ability to experience all this together, alongside each other. However, Australian arts companies and organisations are stepping up, offering alternatives that make them accessible from home — or at least offering suggestions on how to help ensure their survival on the other side of COVID-19. Here are some of them.  This year's Biennale of Sydney — titled Nirin (meaning 'edge' in Wiradjuri) — is migrating online as of this week. In coming weeks, they say they'll be offering virtual walk-throughs and 360-degree tours via the Google Arts & Culture platform. In the meantime: head to their Instagram to catch up on curator-led tours through the different Biennale venues; and keep an eye on their YouTube for new content (which currently includes a look at Tony Albert's outdoor 'greenhouse' on Cockatoo Island).   The National Gallery of Victoria has launched immersive virtual tours of its exhibitions: you can currently 'walk' through the their blockbuster (and normally ticketed) exhibitions Keith Haring | Jean Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines (and listen to the audio guide at the same time) and Kaws: Companionship in the Age of Loneliness. Bendigo Art Gallery have created an online version of their exhibition Bessie Davidson and Sally Smart: Two artists and the Parisian avant-garde. The exhibition, which was open for just one day before the gallery had to close, features more than 50 paintings by lesser-known Australian Impressionist Bessie Davidson, who found success in 19th-century Paris, alongside works by her great-niece: renowned Australian artist Sally Smart.   Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA) are using their YouTube channel to showcase conversations with artists, in-depth looks into collections and hypnotic time-lapses of large-scale installations being built.  Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) might be closed, but Tim — a former tattoo-parlour manager turned living sculpture — is live-streaming his endurance performance in the empty gallery from 10:00am-4.30pm daily. Many art gallery stores are also still open online. Support your favourite gallery by buying gifts for others and yourself. For what it's worth, MONA is doing its bit by continuing to sell its infamous yet beloved vulva-shaped soap online — finally bring together art and hygiene.   Most cinemas are offering customers full refunds on any unused tickets. In the meantime, purchasing gift cards and cinema memberships for future use will help ensure they can be operational in a post-coronavirus world. While we're temporarily deprived of new releases on the big screen, Australia is lucky to have more streaming services available than ever. Netflix, Stan, Foxtel, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and Disney Plus — as well as specialist services like DocPlay (documentaries), Hayu (reality TV) and Kayo (sports) — all require subscriptions.    On the other hand, ABC iView, SBS On Demand and commercial TV catch-up services cost nothing. And anyone with an Australian library account has access to Beamafilm and Kanopy, which offer a range of top-quality recent release movies and TV shows. Recent releases on Kanopy right now include Carol, Room, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and I Am Not Your Negro.  (Though public libraries are closed, here are ways to get the most out of your membership.) For Australian musicians working in an industry already gutted by illegal pirating and paltry shares offered by streaming services, playing live shows was often the last reliable source of income. For performers, tour managers, venue operators and crew alike, the closure of venues has now obliterated that revenue stream too. The industry's response? Isol-Aid music festival, which sees Australian musicians play music from home studios and bedrooms each weekend on Instagram. The sets raise money and awareness for Support Act — a charity supporting music workers impacted by Covid-19 (and was already supporting music workers affected by bushfires).   Find out which artists are scheduled via their Instagram account, hop onto the artist's Instagram at the scheduled time, and tune into the likes of Sarah Blasko, Courtney Barnett, Campcope and Montaigne playing intimate sets. And then, of course, donate to Support Act.  A special ""lunchtime"" edition of the festival — Isol-Aid: Lunch Without Borders — will be streaming from their Instagram this Wednesday from 11:30am to 1:30pm — featuring 15-minute sets from five artists, including Gordi, Asgeir, Julien Baker and Of Monsters And Men's Nanna Bryndis Hilmarsdottir. (Also consider paying for downloads of songs and albums instead of relying on Spotify and Apple Music. Direct downloads from Bandcamp allows artists to retain money. One recent fundraiser on the platform saw over $7 million AUD worth of music and merch sold, with profits retained by musicians. Better yet: order vinyl if available and support local record stores in the process.) With 640 shows scheduled, MICF 2020 was set to break records over its scheduled three-and-a-half week festival. Instead, it's making history for more sombre reasons. MICF's cancellation has also meant hundreds of other comedy shows across Australia have also been cancelled.   This Sunday (April 12), the ABC brings the festival into homes with a special Comedy Care Package at 8:20pm. Hosted by Denise Scott, the special will showcase the best of past MICF Galas, featuring festival favourites Aaron Chen, Anne Edmonds, Becky Lucas, Cal Wilson, Dave Hughes, Frank Woodley, Kitty Flanagan, Nazeem Hussain, Steph Tisdell, Tom Gleeson and Urzila Carlson. If you're not following your favourite comedians on social media already, now's a great time to discover what podcasts or video content they're producing. Judith Lucy's Overwhelmed and Dying (aren't we all?) podcast couldn't be more relevant or timely.  ABC Comedy has a dedicated TV station (Channel 22) and iView channel. Stan, Netflix and Amazon Prime have their own existing or upcoming Australian comedy specials to mine, including Zoë Coombs Marr's acclaimed stand-up show Bossy Bottom (available on Amazon Prime from April 10).  Punters can also make tax deductible donations to MICF to ensure the festival's survival. Ticket holders can also donate the value of their purchased tickets to the artist they were going to see, or email box office to arrange for a percentage of the sale to be retained. Follow MICF's Twitter and Facebook accounts to see daily mini-sets from previous festivals. Melbourne drag queen Victoria Bitter wrote this compilation of ways Australia's drag community has activated remotely and online during Covid-19 venue closures.  Renowned drag performance artist Betty Grumble offers free daily 10:00am workouts via Instagram Live.  Queer Space — who've had to cancel events that focus on regional cities — are seeking immediate financial aid for their artists through their #BuyATicket campaign. They are also hosting Queer Space Virtual Trivia live on their Facebook page on Tuesdays at 8:00pm.  As Eamon Flack and Sue Donnelly of Sydney's Belvoir St Theatre put it, now is ""a time diabolically unsuited to theatre"". Many Australian theatre companies are asking audiences to consider donating unused tickets as a tax-deductible refund.  Australian National Theatre Live — which specialises in filming Australian theatre productions for cinema release — will host the Virus Free Theatre Festival. This week it's showing The Dapto Chaser by Australian playwright Mary Rachel Brown — filmed at Sydney's SBW Stables Theatre in July 2015 — on Friday April 10 and Saturday April 11 at 8:00pm, via its Facebook page.    While Sydney Dance Company is unable to perform for audiences, it earns substantial revenue through its dance classes. Unlimited dance classes are available for $28 a week through their virtual studio. Smaller dance companies and studios also offer similar classes. Meanwhile The Australian Ballet has newly launched Ballet TV, broadcasting some of its most beloved ballets free of charge with cinema-quality recordings of full-length performances, starting with David McAllister's completely OTT production of The Sleeping Beauty.  Missed out on seeing Opera Australia's Attila? Two performances were staged before social distancing was introduced and ABC Classic recorded the second performance, which is available to stream for free. Sydney Chamber Opera was able to film their new production of Breaking Glass (in front of an audience-free theatre): four new one-act mini-operas composed by emerging female composers Peggy Polias, Josephine Macken, Georgia Scott and Bree van Reyk — all of which will be streamed soon. Having had to stop its popular live-stream concerts, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is now offering a new performance from its archives every Thursday night at 7:30pm via YouTube. Thursday April 9 you can catch Sir Andrew Davis' Grammy-nominated arrangement of Handel's Messiah (the ultimate Easter banger). The Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) has launched ACO HomeCasts, an extensive and innovative digital content season that will bring the music and musicians of the ACO directly into Australian homes.  Like musicians, authors tour the country with every book release, relying on a network of bookshop events and writers' festivals to ensure their work is properly promoted. The absence of festivals and bookshop storefronts now threaten the livelihoods of writers across the country.  While major writers festivals like the Sydney Writers Festival have had to cancel completely, the Newcastle Writers Festival went ahead — completely online — this past weekend, and the 2020 sessions are available on their YouTube channel. Many local bookshops are still forging ahead with author events via video on Zoom or Facebook, where you can be even more intimate with authors and ask them questions via webcam or in the comments.  Many local independent bookshops — such as Avid Reader in Brisbane, Better Read Than Dead in Sydney and Readings in Melbourne — now also offer free delivery within certain postcodes, with staff delivering purchases to your door via bike and foot. Head to the Australian Independent Bookseller website, pop in your postcode and you'll see shops nearest to you.  Australia's most recognisable built structure, and premier home of the arts, has been forced to shut up shop. In response, the Sydney Opera House has launched From Our House to Yours. Every Wednesday to Sunday night at 6:00pm, the Opera House will release archival footage, live broadcasts and even premieres.    This coming week features an author talk with bestselling children's book author (and actor/comedian) David Walliams (Wednesday April 8, 10:00am); a conversation between Clementine Ford and Flex Mami recorded at All About Women 2020 (Thursday April 9, 8:00pm); a live set from Panda Bear — aka Animal Collective co-founder Noah Lennox (Friday April 10, 8:00pm); author and philosopher Alain de Botton discussing On Love (Saturday April 11, 8:00pm) and the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs' performance of Handel's Messiah — performed in Auslan (Sunday April 12, 10:00am). As featured on Australian Story, Astrid Jorgensen's Pub Choir has connected Australians in large live spaces across the country, redefining what choirs can be.    Now they can no longer meet up in person, Pub Choir has gone online, reinvented itself as a Couch Choir, and asked participants to submit their individual parts from self-isolation. A video editor then stitches the parts together to glorious results.  In less than a week, their version of Close to You was viewed over 300,000 times, with over 1,000 people from 18 countries participating. We defy you not to cry while watching and thinking of loved ones you miss. ",ABC Arts      By Benjamin Law for Stop Everything! with Dee Jefferson,"April 08, 2020"

5,/news/2020-04-04/bill-withers-dead-at-81/12121238,"Bill Withers, legendary soul singer who wrote Lean On Me, dies aged 81","Bill Withers, the legendary US soul singer who wrote Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine has died aged 81 of heart complications.   The three-time Grammy Award winner, who withdrew from making music in the mid-1980s, died on Monday (local time) in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his family.  He is survived by his wife Marcia Johnson and their two children, Todd and Kori. ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world,"" the statement from his family said. ""In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones,"" the statement said.   Withers' songs have become the soundtracks of countless cherished moments. Lean on Me, was performed at the inaugurations of both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.    Ain't No Sunshine and Lean on Me are among Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ""He's the last African-American Everyman,"" musician and bandleader Questlove told Rolling Stone in 2015.  ""Bill Withers is the closest thing black people have to a Bruce Springsteen."" Many who knew Withers or were inspired by him took to social media to express their grief.  Broadway star Lin-Manuel Miranda referred to Withers as a ""maestro"", singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz said, ""My soul always has & always will be full of your music"", and singer-songwriter John Legend reflected that ""life won't be the same without him"".   Withers, who overcame a childhood stutter, was born the last of six children in the coal mining town of Slab Fork, West Virginia.  He joined the Navy at 17 and spent nine years in the service as an aircraft mechanic installing toilets.  After his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, worked at an aircraft parts factory, bought a guitar at a pawn shop and recorded demos of his tunes in hopes of landing a recording contract.   In 1971, signed to Sussex Records, he put out his first album, Just As I Am, with the legendary Booker T Jones at the helm.  It had the hits Grandma's Hands and Ain't No Sunshine, which was inspired by the Jack Lemmon film Days Of Wine And Roses.  Ain't No Sunshine was originally released as the B-side of his debut single, Harlem.  But radio DJs flipped the disc and the song climbed to number three on the Billboard charts and spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 40. Withers went on to generate more hits a year later with the inspirational Lean on Me, the menacing Who Is He (And What Is He to You) and the slinky Use Me on his second album, Still Bill.   Later would come Lovely Day, co-written with Skip Scarborough and featuring Withers holding the word ""day"" for almost 19 seconds, and Just the Two Of Us, co-written with Ralph MacDonald and William Salter.  His Live at Carnegie Hall in 1973 made Rolling Stone's 50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time. ""The hardest thing in songwriting is to be simple and yet profound. And Bill seemed to understand, intrinsically and instinctively, how to do that,"" Sting said in Still Bill, a 2010 documentary of Withers. Though his songs often dealt with relationships, Withers also wrote ones with social commentary, including ""Better Off Dead"" about an alcoholic's suicide, and ""I Can't Write Left-Handed,"" about an injured Vietnam War veteran. He was awarded Grammys as a songwriter for Ain't No Sunshine in 1971 and for Just the Two Of Us in 1981. In 1987, Withers received his ninth Grammy nomination and third Grammy as a songwriter for the re-recording of the 1972 hit Lean on Me by Club Nouveau.   He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 by Stevie Wonder.  ""I'm not a virtuoso, but I was able to write songs that people could identify with. I don't think I've done bad for a guy from Slab Fork, West Virginia,"" Withers told Rolling Stone in 2015. ABC/AP",,"April 04, 2020"

In February, the singer-songwriter won Australia Decides, outscoring Casey Donovan, Vanessa Amorosi and seven other acts to clinch a spot at Eurovision. However, last month growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus led the European Broadcasting Union and this year's scheduled hosts, the Netherlands, to announce the cancellation of 2020's event.  The art-pop performer had delivered the winning song, Don't Break Me, with a dramatic staging at the live Gold Coast final.     While appearing at this year's Australia Decides, Dami Im — who produced Australia's best performance at Eurovision when she came second with Sounds of Silence in 2016 — drew a big reaction when she announced that she was going to throw her hat in the ring for 2021. But SBS has now followed the lead of a number of countries involved in the contest by confirming Montaigne's place as Australia's representative next year. ""I'm so happy to receive this good news during such times,"" Montaigne said in a statement. ""At home, we've started this ritual of cracking open a fortune cookie daily and reading our fortunes to each other and I got one that read, 'You will be sharing great news with all the people you love'.

With the contest to decide Australia's entrant for next year now not needed, SBS said the focus would turn to developing new music. ""Although SBS and fans alike will miss Eurovision — Australia Decides 2021, this will honour Australia's decision and give Montaigne the chance to show the world what we already know — that she is an incredibly talented, exciting and original artist,"" SBS commissioning editor and Australia's Eurovision head of delegation Josh Martin said. ""Our focus will now shift to a new song for 2021 and Montaigne is not wasting a moment of this period of isolation with many new ideas already on the table!""

Festival production manager Ahva Dub said organisers wanted the event to proceed in some form to support local artists, despite COVID-19 social-gathering restrictions causing a shutdown of the industry. ""From 25,000 [people] down to no public interaction, it's a bit of a turnaround, but you've got to move with the times,"" Mr Dub said. ""Being able to broadcast it [virtually], we can still pay the artists and technical crew from the grant money we've received from the Government. ""It seemed only fair to do our best to put on a good show, in whatever format that could happen in.""     The festival is one of a growing number of events heading online, including the livestreaming of festival Isol-Aid to help combat the more than $300 million in income lost by musicians during Australia's coronavirus shutdown. ""We're giving the artists a chance to get their talents out there still … and bringing it to people at home who might be in isolation,"" Mr Dub said. ""It'll be just like Nightcliff Seabreeze is normally — it gives a sense of togetherness, community … and maybe a bit of a light in the darkness."" Mr Dub said the logistical arrangements for a virtual Nightcliff Seabreeze Festival were still a work in progress, particularly with frequent updates to federal and NT restrictions. ""The ideas have been changing with every announcement from the Prime Minister,"" he said. ""What I say now may change again by the time we get to [the event date on] May 9, but we're already starting to connect with the artists — to find out what they're comfortable doing in the current environment, and what wizardry we can accomplish with technology."" Among these artists is the Garrangali Band from the remote Arnhem Land community of Baniyala, which has been under strict COVID-19 travel and quarantine restrictions. Keyboardist Brendan Marika said the festival's move to an online platform meant bands like his could ""still get a message across"", while protecting their wellbeing. ""Money is one thing, but performing and sharing our music is another,"" Marika said. ""[An online event is] not the same … it's not like you can have the crowd there cheering you on, and enjoying, dancing — but the main thing is getting that message across, and this is finding a way.""       NT singer-songwriter Juran Adams, who performs as Jurxn, said she has had to put much of her career ""on hold"" due to the pandemic, but she appreciated the move to a new platform. ""I'll miss the sense of being with a band and kind of losing myself onstage,"" she said. ""But it's just another opportunity to get recognised, and I'm really grateful.""   Other NT festivals and events, including the Finke Desert Race and Garma Festival, have had to cancel and plan for an uncertain future. NT Tourism Minister Lauren Moss said in the past financial year alone, ""the six events delivered by NT Major Events contributed an economic stimulus of $48 million to the NT economy"". ""We know that the many community events from Glenti to Barunga to the Desert Song Festival are also economically, socially and culturally important to the Territory,"" Ms Moss said.   The NT Government said it had been holding emergency talks with event operators during the coronavirus outbreak. ""The events industry is traditionally an agile sector used to dealing with unexpected circumstances — this resilience will help the sector return once the COVID-19 situation ends,"" Ms Moss said.

But it was an Uber ride after he returned home that proved the most likely source — a lesson in how long the virus can linger on surfaces in public places. Mr Williams is one of the hundreds of Australians now in self-isolation after having contracted the deadly virus.   Mr Williams returned from a band tour in Japan on March 8. This was prior to the two-week self-isolation rule being introduced for travellers.  He had a recording session with his band, Art Vs Science, on March 16. There he came into close contact with band member and mate Jim Finn, who now also has the virus. Mr Williams had no symptoms by this stage and was told to self-isolate after the recording session.  ""Seems like he would have got it from me, which is a pretty messed up feeling,"" Mr Williams told 7.30. Mr Williams and his partner were tested on March 19.   He said health authorities had since told him he might have been exposed to COVID-19 on March 14, during a car trip with the ridesharing service Uber, after he returned to Australia. ""Apparently either the driver or someone in the car before me had tested positive,"" he said. ""It seems like maybe that's where I caught it from. ""Either that or I caught it and gave it to the Uber driver, which I would feel terrible about."" Since finding out he had tested positive, more friends in Mr Williams' social group have returned positive tests. Mr Finn's fiancee Dom has also been tested for the illness. Mr Finn went into self-isolation in his Bondi apartment, with Dom initially making him meals. ""I can't put my toothbrush back in our communal toothbrush holder when I brush my teeth because otherwise COVID-19 hops straight from my brush onto Dom's,"" he said. ""I'm feeling pretty lethargic but it just might be a mental thing from being stuck in here. Just been doing music and watching Netflix."" Dom has since returned a negative result, but may have contracted a cold. ""Dom woke up and she's got a headache, she's got blocked sinus and a sore throat, and those were the exact symptoms I had when this whole thing kicked off,"" Mr Finn said.   The experience of Mr Williams and his friends has highlighted just how easily the coronavirus is transmitted. Professor Brendan Crabb said the public cannot afford to be complacent. ""We have to assume at the moment [that] surfaces are contaminated,"" he said. Current estimates suggest the coronavirus is more contagious than seasonal influenza, living longer on surfaces and spreading more easily between humans, sometimes before symptoms even emerge.   These estimates suggest a rate of one person on average spreading the virus to about 2.5 people, compared to 1.3 for the flu. ""Given that on average each person under normal circumstances will transmit the virus to three other people, we've got to find out who those other people they've had contact with,"" Professor Crabb said. ""Where we're at in Australia at the moment is using the only tool we have, which is shutting down to a large degree a functioning society, to minimise the chances of people contacting one another."" In a statement, Uber Australia said it is continually monitoring the coronavirus situation and taking steps to keep the community safe, including providing disinfectant to drivers for cars and suspending accounts of drivers with a positive test.     Australian Louise Robertson is stuck inside her Manhattan studio apartment after testing positive — she's not sure how she picked up the illness. ""I started by waking up with a bad headache and I had body aches [but] before that day I had lost my sense of taste and my sense of smell,"" she told 7.30. ""It's really hard to get tested here and [required] several calls, hours on the phone, nurses, different urgent care clinics, trying to convince someone to get [me] tested. ""Eventually I found a clinic around the corner from my apartment, who allowed me to come in and get a nasal swab and then my results came back three days later.""

13,/news/2020-03-31/coronavirus-songs-latest-in-long-history-of-singing-in-disasters/12102164,Coronavirus songs aren't new: Storytelling songs have been adapted through the ages in times of disaster,"Throughout history we have been singing our way through disasters — from the Black Death to coronavirus, lyrics have been adapted to suit the era. English nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and Neil Diamond's recently altered Sweet Caroline, are two examples of how we have used songs to get us through disastrous times. While the initial lyrics of many nursery rhymes may have been more innocent, they were rewritten and adapted over the centuries to reflect the times, accumulating layers of meaning.    Their function was to educate, provide a warning and offer coping mechanisms in recovery, according to James Cook University cultural historian, Chrystopher Spicer. ""Stories have always been passed down from generation to generation, whether it was by song or dance or so-called nursery rhymes,"" Dr Spicer said. ""We're really doing the same thing now when you look at people adapting songs to the current pandemic that's going on.""     Social media feeds have been awash with a multitude of coronavirus-themed song parodies — among them many versions of The Knack's 1979 hit My Sharona, reworked as My Corona— during this pandemic. Many of them communicate important messages of hygiene whilst also poking fun at social restrictions.  Writer, musician, performer and radio broadcaster Casey Bennetto, the author of the award-winning Keating: The Musical, said comedy is often used to ""say the unsayable"". ""Comedy is a useful tool for skirting around things that can't be expressed in any other way — particularly musical comedy,"" he said. One of Bennetto's favourite parodies is Keir Nuttall's controversial COVID-19, which he said was a well-rounded parody, based on the classic song I was only 19 by Redgum. ""It was good writing,"" he said. While many of these songs may not endure though the ages, Bennetto said in the age of social media they served a purpose.   One of the most well-known nursery rhymes, that has gathered meaning throughout history with a multitude of versions in different languages, is Ring a Ring o' Roses, also known as or Ring Around the Rosie.   Although thought to have originated during paganism with more innocent lyrics, Dr Spicer said the lyrics may have been adapted during the Great Plague of London in 1665.  He said the 'rosie' referred to the rash that developed on the skin from the bubonic plague with the 'atishoo atishoo' referring to the transmission via sneezing and 'we all fall down' a reference to the deaths — 15 per cent of Britain's population died.  Dr Spicer also said many earlier versions of nursery rhymes had far darker origins, often filled with brutality with most people only familiar with the printed version of nursery rhymes during the 19th century. ""Which was a great age for sanitising things and for taking those terrible things out,"" he said, which he also found amusing given the brutality of child labour during that era, especially in the coal mine industry.   Execution was the theme of the traditional English nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons, which dates to a 1665 square dance, according to Dr Spicer. Earlier versions had ""and here comes the chopper to chop of your head"". ""A very bloodthirsty last line to it at the end,"" he said. The references to bells refer to the city of London churches that would ring out signalling a public execution. Dr Spicer said each church could be distinguished by the different peal of the bells, helping with navigation around the city. ""So perhaps the rhyme also had an educational value for children, to teach them the bells in order for them not to become lost — kind of a pre-GPS navigating device,"" he said.   In more recent times songs and rhymes have been used as important teaching tools in schools from Australia to the South Pacific. Dr Spicer said there is an interesting cultural attachment to natural disasters in North Queensland because cyclones were regular events there throughout history. ""They are actually part of the seasonal calendar in Queensland, you have the cyclone season in Queensland,"" he said.   With many children traumatised by the effects of the cyclone, one project in Innisfail worked with children helping them express their feelings through song after cyclone Larry. ""[It was designed] to be able to evoke this event that's happened to them,"" Dr Spicer said. Similarly, a disaster risk-management project in the Solomon Islands taught children life-saving skills through songs and rhymes. Dr Spicer said these songs helped not only reduce the fear but were educational.  ","ABC Central Victoria      By Larissa Romensky, Emmie Dowling and Anne-Marie Middlemast","March 31, 2020"
14,/news/2020-03-31/coronavirus-songs-latest-in-long-history-of-singing-in-disasters/12102164,Coronavirus songs aren't new: Storytelling songs have been adapted through the ages in times of disaster,"Throughout history we have been singing our way through disasters — from the Black Death to coronavirus, lyrics have been adapted to suit the era. English nursery rhyme Ring a Ring o' Roses and Neil Diamond's recently altered Sweet Caroline, are two examples of how we have used songs to get us through disastrous times. While the initial lyrics of many nursery rhymes may have been more innocent, they were rewritten and adapted over the centuries to reflect the times, accumulating layers of meaning.    Their function was to educate, provide a warning and offer coping mechanisms in recovery, according to James Cook University cultural historian, Chrystopher Spicer. ""Stories have always been passed down from generation to generation, whether it was by song or dance or so-called nursery rhymes,"" Dr Spicer said. ""We're really doing the same thing now when you look at people adapting songs to the current pandemic that's going on.""

15,/news/2020-03-29/bob-dylan-and-johnny-cash-singer-songwriter-rock-star/12091824,How the sensitive singer-songwriter was born and changed music forever,"When Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash sat down in February 1969 to make music together they had one small problem. What would they play? Cash looked across at Dylan and said, ""What about we play Girl from the North Country?"". Dylan looked coy, ""I don't think I can play that one Johnny"". The reason was unclear. Certainly Dylan's use of amphetamines had taken the edge off his prodigious memory but more likely the ever forward looking Dylan didn't fancy dragging up a song from his back catalogue.   Not to be denied, Cash persisted and slowly coaxed Dylan into a country-styled remake of an achingly beautiful song of loss and regret. Released later that year as the opening track to the album Nashville Skyline, the song was a key offering on an LP focused on love and the virtues of country living.  Not only did Dylan shock the world with his embrace of country music, he also set the template for a new genre of music: the sensitive singer-songwriter. In his book Hearts of Darkness: the Unlikely Rise of the Singer-Songwriter, author Dave Thompson chronicles the remarkable blossoming of this new music as the decade turned. It was a music that replaced volume with melody, posturing with intimacy, and city with country. For the next two years it would dominate the music charts. What Thompson makes clear is the extraordinary way this new movement grew, as if by magic, in so many parts of the world.   As we now know, even as Dylan was sitting down with Cash in Nashville, a young singer named Cat Stevens was having his own moment of revelation in London. For much of the 1960s Stevens had been a man in a hurry to become a star. He'd had hits, Matthew and Son and I Love My Dog.  But in 1968 he been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Spending three months in hospital he emerged from his solitude with a new view of the world. As 1969 progressed he sensed a change in himself and the audience. Like Dylan he decided less was more.  Asked to play as the support act for the incendiary rock band The Who, Stevens took the stage with just an acoustic guitar. The promotors were appalled.  The crowd loved it. Asked about this new approach he simply said. ""The quieter you play the more people will listen"". It was a philosophy that in less than a year would make him a superstar. Across the Atlantic, at almost exactly the same time, young songwriter by the name of James Taylor was also trying to pick up the pieces of a faltering career. Depressed and addicted to heroin, Taylor had been admitted to hospital.  Released, but still struggling with his addiction, the experience had sparked him to write a song about a woman he'd met in recovery, who'd later taken her own life. Titled Fire and Rain, Taylor had been toying with it for almost a year.  Then in late 1969 his producer Peter Asher listening to a demo recording of the piece had an epiphany. Get rid of the layered instruments. Create a musical setting that made the listener think it was simply Taylor and his guitar playing for them, with all other instruments playing in support roles.   Released in February 1970 the song with its chilling opening line ""just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone"" announced a new decade had truly begun, a new type of artist had arrived. An artist who exposed the intimate elements of their life in song. Club owner Doug Weston, who ran LA's Troubadour Club, put it succinctly when asked why he'd booked people like Taylor saying, ""people were sick of music that looked outward all the time. They want to hear what was on the inside too"". If intimacy was the goal, no-one was more capable of revelation than Joni Mitchell.  Canadian born but now a resident of Laurel Canyon in LA, she was already the author of songs that had quickly become standards. Even more fearless artistically than Taylor she had never been afraid to bare her soul in song. Now the world had caught up   As if to complete the circle, just as Taylor hit the big time, the pair became lovers. He wrote about her and she wrote about him. The result? A series of songs that formed her album Blue.  As Mitchell well knew this was her inner soul on display. ""At that period of my life, I had no personal defences. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes."" In Los Angeles another Canadian by the name of Neil Young, was also battling to balance fame with artistic instinct. Yes, he was part of one of the biggest selling acts in music but none of that made him artistically happy.  Ever the loner, Young would think nothing of getting in his van and driving between gigs. Now he wanted that person on record.  Taking time off the road Young gathered a few friends in his home studio and set to working making his own album.   Taking inspiration from a film script written by his pal Dean Stockwell, Young began writing a soundtrack for the intended movie. The centre-piece was the song After the Goldrush that would in turn give the album its title.  Panned by the critics on its release the record was devoured by music buyers who revelled in its fragility. For the music industry it was clear pain had a payoff and no-one was more aware of it than Doug Weston as he watched his Troubadour Club fill up each night with people wanting to hear Young bare his soul, ""a solo songwriter singing songs about his own life, his own pain, his own thoughts Before people wrote about bigger issues following Dylan's lead. Dylan rarely sang directly about his own life, he may have inserted it into his lyrics but he did not openly discuss it"". And here was the conundrum for this new group of artists.  In exposing their inner lives they had reformed their relationship with their audience.  Understandably, according to Dave Thompson, the fans began to believe they knew the performers. The problem for the artist was that ultimately such scrutiny was near impossible to live with. As James Taylor said of his newfound fame: ""I don't enjoy selling myself. They (the fans) want to know what I read and what I'm like, and I don't really know myself."" Cat Stevens too was unprepared for the scrutiny, ""they try to make too much of my songs. I don't know why I write them. But they try and find all kinds of hidden meanings…"" But if Taylor, Mitchell and Stevens were having second thoughts about fame built on intimacy that fear wasn't transferred to a hungry batch of artists waiting for their shot at the big time, nor the record executives that lined up to sign up their very own singer songwriter. In the rush for gold many nuggets were unearthed. Kris Kristofferson, Randy Newman and Jackson Browne to name a few. Established songwriters too suddenly became stars in their own right including Carole King, whose album Tapestry sold a staggering three million copies. As record executives rushed to sign a new batch of would be Taylors and Mitchells though, the wheel was already turning. Knitted jumpers, laid back sounds and confessional song-writing was starting to become its own straight-jacket and even worse, it was quickly becoming a cliche. Song-writer and scenester Kim Fowley put it best when he said, ""What caused glam rock? Simple: James Taylor, saggy tits and granola ... all kinds of men and women sitting on stools wearing overalls and flower print dresses singing about Laurel canyon. It was horrifying, it wasn't rock and roll"".   He was right. By 1972 the biggest star in the firmament was David Bowie in the form of Ziggy Stardust.  Glam rock was the new wonder child and singer songwriters were fighting for their place in world. In time music would visit the Dark Side of the Moon, hear men singing in very high voices ""Staying Alive"" and catch full blown disco fever. The big wheel had turned and it would keep on turning.

17,/news/2020-03-28/coronavirus-anxieties-eased-with-therapists-song-online/12085842,Coronavirus anxieties eased with Tasmanian therapist's song for kids,"A Tasmanian music therapist has struck a chord with families worldwide with her song and chant to help ease coronavirus anxiety.   Allison Davies, a neurologic music therapist and mother, posted a simple phone video of herself singing in the kitchen that has garnered more than 2.5 million views in a week.   She has been sent videos of people singing her coronavirus chant for kids on balconies in Italy.  And the BBC interviewed her by phone, from her kitchen, in her home near Wynyard in north-west Tasmania. ""I have received thousands of videos from all over the world of parents and kids singing the song together,"" Ms Davies said. ""And in languages including Greek, Spanish and Hebrew.  ""I can't even get to see them all, but many now go through an Instagram hashtag campaign #everylittlecell.""    The song was designed to work as a mantra or chant to be sung around the house and, Ms Davies said, to be a friendly earworm that stays in your head.  In the video she sang:  ""Every little cell in my body is happy, every little cell in my body is well … "" She said of the chant, ""I made a post, just encouraging parents to sing the song around the house"". ""They don't have to explain to the kids what it's about, or even [get them] to join in,"" Ms Davies said.  ""And when we have a catchy tune like that stuck in our head or we sing it over and over, it helps our nervous system to regulate. ""So my post was just to show how a little song can support anxiety management, but it's gone nuts! Millions of people have seen it."" The tune Allison used just sprang from her memory and, as far as she can determine, was derived from a parody of a tune written by Carl Anthony in the 1980s.     The Every Little Cell chant has been translated into multiple languages by families singing it to each other and trying to stay calm in dark times. But words aside, the therapist said some of the universal power and reach of music as therapy was because elements like melody, rhythm and repetition were key to activating positive brain function. ""When we experience melody, it activates more of our brain than any other thing that research has shown us,"" Ms Davies said. ""When we experience anxiety or dis-regulation or we're in survival mode, generally our pre-frontal cortex kind of switches off.  ""And that's the part of the brain that we need to work so we can analyse what's going on right now, make decisions and stay calm.""   Easier to grasp is the effect melody has on the emotional centre of the brain.  As Ms Davies puts it, you only need to have seen some musical theatre or a Hollywood movie to know melody can swing a mood. ""When we sing really simple little tunes, we can move emotions through us so they don't become pent up,"" she said. ""A bonus is that when we sing, it's an outbreath. A chant creates a nice controlled inbreath and out again through singing. ""And when we sing something over and over, we are creating a sense of predictability. ""At a time like this when routine is out the door, singing allows us to have some predictability in our environment."" Above all else, Ms Davies said, music has a great power to make people feel connected. The song also caught the attention of Melbourne film producer Diana Fisk, who has put together a video, showing people singing the song in different parts of the world. ""The song really caught my ear and eye and I just wanted to spread the love of the song by helping out with a bit of editing,"" Ms Fisk said.    After training through the Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy in Canada, Ms Davies has worked in many areas of home and hospital-based therapy, from bonding parents and children through rhythm and song to helping juvenile detainees and stroke victims. ""I work predominantly with people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury and we use music or singing, specifically, to rehabilitate speech,"" Ms Davies said.   Growing up in a house full of music — her brother and mother were both musicians while her father passed on his passion for music appreciation — music was always big in Ms Davies' life. Used to people suggesting that her time in training might have paid more had she aspired to be a more conventional health professional, she said her instinct from the start was that she had found her path.

Mr McGowan, who is about to turn 70, was among the last of the students to learn as part of the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind (RVIB) training program in the 1960s. He learnt the intricacies of setting a scale and recognising pitch and frequencies for which an acute sense of hearing is crucial. It is a skill that is better suited to the blind, according to Mr McGowan, and one he loves. ""To tune a piano properly is just lovely, it makes you feel good, and it makes people happy,"" Mr McGowan said. These days technology has replaced people, with many using computer programs attached to mobile phones to do the job But it is nowhere near as accurate as the ear according to Mr McGowan who laments the lost skill and said the only place in the world for blind people to train closed two years ago in the United States. ""I think it's really sad. Many blind people are unemployed and now living off the NDIS,"" Mr McGowan said. A 2018 study by Vision Australia found only 24 per cent of people who were blind or vision-impaired were in full-time employment. Vice-President of the Australasian Piano Tuners of Australia (APTTA) Michael Ryan said there were no training schools or apprenticeships available in Australia, with the trade removed from the register 10 years ago. ""We have been pushing for a long time for training to be reinstated,"" Mr Ryan said. Born in 1950, Mr McGowan's optic nerves were damaged when he was born three months premature.  ""In those days we were lucky to live, but they couldn't get rid of us,"" he said. From the age of two-and-a-half, the RVIB became young Mr McGowan's weekday home, then on weekends, he would return to the suburbs, often greeting Mondays in tears. ""But that's the way it was, you got used to it,"" Mr McGowan said.   The RVIB was the first institution of its type in Australia, opened in 1866 as the Victorian Asylum and School for the Blind before being renamed in 1891 as the RVIB. However, the era for specialised schools for the blind ended in 2009, when the RVIB made way for Vision Australia, part of a move toward a more integrated approach to education. ""Students who are blind or have low vision are best educated alongside their sighted peers, with access to educational resources and tools of their choosing,"" a spokesperson for Vision Australia said. But Mr McGowan does not agree. ""We grew up in the best time possible for blind people, the staff were good, the school was good, the system was as close to perfect as you'll ever get,"" he said.   Ever since Mr McGowan was 12 years old, he wanted to learn how to tune a piano. ""I remember when I was five, someone took the top off a piano and I fell inside and felt the bass strings of the bottom, and I kind of liked the feel of it,"" he laughed. His two-year course at the RVIB began in 1967, eventually leading to more than a decade of employment at Allans Music, a popular chain of music stores throughout Australia. The keen piano player has been working ever since. ""I've had a wonderful career out of this job,"" Mr McGowan said. His first concert job at the age of 22 was for the American band Chicago. The following year he met Diana Ross and Ian Anderson from the British Rock group Jethro Tull, whom he considered a ""really nice guy"". ""It's just another tuning job, you've got to make sure you do it properly,"" Mr McGowan said.  These days he works for three different stores in Melbourne, which includes home visits.  ""I'll be tuning as long as I can,"" he said. ",ABC Central Victoria      By                                 Larissa Romensky,"March 24, 2020"

25,/news/2020-03-21/kenny-rogers-dies-at-age-81/12078272,Kenny Rogers dies at 81 after a decorated country music career,"American country singer-songwriter Kenny Rogers has died at the age of 81.   His family announced he passed away peacefully at his home from natural causes. Rogers's entertainment career spanned more than six decades, with chart-topping hits including The Gambler and Islands In The Stream. His family is planning a small private service out of concern for the coronavirus pandemic, and will celebrate his life publicly with friends and fans at a later date. The Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records and won three Grammys. He was also the star of TV movies based on The Gambler and other songs, making him a superstar in the 1970s and '80s.   Rogers thrived for some 60 years before he retired from touring in 2017 at the age of 79.  Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer. ""You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don't invite comparison,"" Rogers told The Associated Press in 2015. ""And I chose that way because I could never be better than Johnny Cash or Willie [Nelson] or Waylon [Jennings] at what they did.  ""So I found something that I could do that didn't invite comparison to them. And I think people thought it was my desire to change country music. But that was never my issue."" A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings.    As a 20-year-old, he had a gold single called That Crazy Feeling under the name Kenneth Rogers, but when that early success stalled, he joined a jazz group, the Bobby Doyle Trio, as a stand-up bass player. But his breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk group, in 1966. The band reformed as First Edition and scored a pop hit with the psychedelic song, Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).  Rogers and First Edition mixed country-rock and folk on songs like Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town — a story of a Vietnam War veteran begging his girlfriend to stay. After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad Lucille in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy. Suddenly the star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade. The Gambler, the Grammy-winning story song penned by Don Schlitz, came out in 1978 and became his signature song with a signature refrain: ""You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."" The song spawned a hit TV movie of the same name and several sequels featuring Rogers as professional gambler Brady Hawkes. It led to a lengthy side career for Rogers as a TV actor and host of several TV specials. Over the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably Dolly Parton. The two were paired at the suggestion of the Bee Gees' Barry Gibb, who wrote their duet Islands In The Stream.   ""Barry was producing an album on me and he gave me this song,"" Rogers told the AP in 2017. ""And I went and learned it and went into the studio and sang it for four days. And I finally looked at him and said: 'Barry, I don't even like this song anymore.'  ""And he said, 'You know what we need? We need Dolly Parton.' I thought, 'Man, that guy is a visionary.'"" Coincidentally, Parton was in the same recording studio in Los Angeles when the idea came up. ""From the moment she marched into that room, that song never sounded the same,"" Rogers said. ""It took on a whole new spirit."" The two singers toured together many times, including to Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and 1987. Over the years they would continue to record together, including their last duet You Can't Make Old Friends, which was released in 2013.

27,/news/2020-03-20/music-venues-fear-they-wont-survive-coronavirus-shutdown/12070540,Fears many Melbourne music venues won't make it through coronavirus shutdown,"It's a city famed for its live music scene, but venue owners in Melbourne say the industry is on the brink of catastrophe because of the coronavirus outbreak, with fears many clubs and pubs won't survive long enough to see performers return to the stage.   The John Curtin Hotel was named after a prime minister who led the country through a war, but in recent times the Carlton pub has been at the heart of Melbourne's live music scene. Owner Ben Russell said the pub's bandroom usually makes up more than half of his business — but after the Federal Government asked for all non-essential mass gatherings to be called off, he cancelled all future gigs. He believes Melbourne's live music scene is facing catastrophe without a government bailout. ""This could be the day the lights went out in terms of live music in Melbourne,"" he said. While the bar and restaurant at his pub are still open, his hotel has lost 80 per cent of its usual business since Saturday. ""We are just getting by, by the skin of our teeth at the moment,"" he said. But the publican knows the bills will keep coming, even while his business is half-closed. He paid about $7,000 last week for his liquor license for the next year. Mr Russell said venues across the city have their liquor-license fees due by March 31, with many hoping for help from the Victorian Government. The state minister responsible for liquor licensing is Marlene Kairouz. Her office said she would be meeting with industry stakeholders on Monday to discuss liquor-licensing fees. But for Mr Russell the biggest hurdle he will face keeping his business running during these times is paying his commercial lease without the usual level of business.  ""A rent freeze would really be incredible, but obviously then there would need to be a mortgage freeze from the banks and a rates freeze from the council, so everyone has to get behind it."" Without significant support Mr Russell said he didn't know how venues would survive the next six months. And he said with many inner-city pubs and clubs like his own sitting in areas of valuable real estate, building owners could consider what else they can do with their premises to make money. He is not the only one worried about how music venues are going to survive. Paris Martine has been booking musicians for Melbourne venues for years. She has booked bands for pubs in Melbourne's inner-north like the Curtin Hotel, the Grace Darling, and the Workers Club as well as the old Billboard nightclub in the CBD, and toured bands from overseas in Australia.   She said the industry has struggled to adjust to the pace with which the industry has been shutting down. She said the fact there were still ""posters for gigs that will never be on the street"", showed how quickly things have changed. Ms Martine believes there has not been enough focus on protecting the buildings that house Melbourne's live music. She was part of an industry emergency phone hook-up this week and said some venues were considering whether they could now afford to renew their liquor license. ""Some venues are looking down the barrel at a $20,000 bill next week and trying to decide whether they can justify paying that bill,"" she said. But the music booker said that for businesses that do give up their liquor license, it may not be easy to re-open when musicians can again perform to crowds. ""The big thing is the licenses are attached to buildings and if we lose those buildings we just won't get them back,"" she said.   She said venues that do forfeit a liquor license are not guaranteed to get a new license or a license with the same conditions they already have, if they do try to re-open down the track. Ms Martine is also concerned about music venues being bought-out for other developments. ""Most venues of significance exist in prominent locations where it is prime real estate,"" she said. Ms Martine said it was important that when live music can return to the city, there were venues still there to be booked.   Melbourne musician Cash Savage has performed everywhere from small Melbourne bars, to large international festivals. Her band had a tour of Europe and a number of festival gigs in Australia cancelled or postponed in the past fortnight, leaving her suddenly without work until September at least.   She is still trying to figure out what she does to earn a living while the coronavirus outbreak shuts down live performances.

28,/news/2020-03-20/music-venues-fear-they-wont-survive-coronavirus-shutdown/12070540,Fears many Melbourne music venues won't make it through coronavirus shutdown,"It's a city famed for its live music scene, but venue owners in Melbourne say the industry is on the brink of catastrophe because of the coronavirus outbreak, with fears many clubs and pubs won't survive long enough to see performers return to the stage.   The John Curtin Hotel was named after a prime minister who led the country through a war, but in recent times the Carlton pub has been at the heart of Melbourne's live music scene. Owner Ben Russell said the pub's bandroom usually makes up more than half of his business — but after the Federal Government asked for all non-essential mass gatherings to be called off, he cancelled all future gigs. He believes Melbourne's live music scene is facing catastrophe without a government bailout. ""This could be the day the lights went out in terms of live music in Melbourne,"" he said. While the bar and restaurant at his pub are still open, his hotel has lost 80 per cent of its usual business since Saturday. ""We are just getting by, by the skin of our teeth at the moment,"" he said. But the publican knows the bills will keep coming, even while his business is half-closed. He paid about $7,000 last week for his liquor license for the next year. Mr Russell said venues across the city have their liquor-license fees due by March 31, with many hoping for help from the Victorian Government. The state minister responsible for liquor licensing is Marlene Kairouz. Her office said she would be meeting with industry stakeholders on Monday to discuss liquor-licensing fees. But for Mr Russell the biggest hurdle he will face keeping his business running during these times is paying his commercial lease without the usual level of business.  ""A rent freeze would really be incredible, but obviously then there would need to be a mortgage freeze from the banks and a rates freeze from the council, so everyone has to get behind it."" Without significant support Mr Russell said he didn't know how venues would survive the next six months. And he said with many inner-city pubs and clubs like his own sitting in areas of valuable real estate, building owners could consider what else they can do with their premises to make money. He is not the only one worried about how music venues are going to survive. Paris Martine has been booking musicians for Melbourne venues for years. She has booked bands for pubs in Melbourne's inner-north like the Curtin Hotel, the Grace Darling, and the Workers Club as well as the old Billboard nightclub in the CBD, and toured bands from overseas in Australia.   She said the industry has struggled to adjust to the pace with which the industry has been shutting down. She said the fact there were still ""posters for gigs that will never be on the street"", showed how quickly things have changed. Ms Martine believes there has not been enough focus on protecting the buildings that house Melbourne's live music. She was part of an industry emergency phone hook-up this week and said some venues were considering whether they could now afford to renew their liquor license. ""Some venues are looking down the barrel at a $20,000 bill next week and trying to decide whether they can justify paying that bill,"" she said. But the music booker said that for businesses that do give up their liquor license, it may not be easy to re-open when musicians can again perform to crowds. ""The big thing is the licenses are attached to buildings and if we lose those buildings we just won't get them back,"" she said.   She said venues that do forfeit a liquor license are not guaranteed to get a new license or a license with the same conditions they already have, if they do try to re-open down the track. Ms Martine is also concerned about music venues being bought-out for other developments. ""Most venues of significance exist in prominent locations where it is prime real estate,"" she said. Ms Martine said it was important that when live music can return to the city, there were venues still there to be booked.   Melbourne musician Cash Savage has performed everywhere from small Melbourne bars, to large international festivals. Her band had a tour of Europe and a number of festival gigs in Australia cancelled or postponed in the past fortnight, leaving her suddenly without work until September at least.   She is still trying to figure out what she does to earn a living while the coronavirus outbreak shuts down live performances. ""The thing about music is, it doesn't actually pay until the show happens,"" she said. ""Our entire business structure is set up around our live music and touring."" She said it felt like the entire industry was unsure how it would get through this crisis. ""Every person who has any interest in music, or any financial interest in music, is just sitting back and going, 'well, what happens now?' ""It looks really grim, and every day gets grimmer."" While Ms Savage said she was still trying to understand what was happening to her industry and how to get through it, she feared many Melbourne music venues would no longer exist when she could again take to the stage.

Live entertainers have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with cancellations flooding in since the Federal Government banned gatherings of more than 100 people. Byron Bay comedian Mandy Nolan is no exception — though instead of hoarding toilet paper and hand sanitiser like many Australians, she has been stocking up on Liquid Paper. ""I'm just worried I haven't got enough,"" she said. ""I've been going through Liquid Papering out my gigs because I don't want to see them.   ""I reckon for me at least $30,000 to $40,000 worth of work's gone."" But Nolan has been quick to look for new ways to work, using her own Facebook page to ask for work mentoring, writing and training. ""One woman said she wanted to do a comedy course and that she'd love to do it online,"" Nolan said. ""She had a group of women that wanted to, so now I'm creating that."" Nolan is also organising a ""backyard"" gig and looking to create an event via video conferencing that people could join for a $5 fee. She said other artists should use the downtime wisely. ""One of the things I would say to creative people is to use this time to create content,"" she said. ""You really have to push through.""   Coffs Harbour-based musician Benny Black said many artists would use the time to write and record new music, but said they should expect lean times.   ""Initially there's not the income to support there,"" he said. ""But when it hits a point of recovery, then artists will be in a place to release that music and there'll be some upside to it, I guess."" The coronavirus restrictions have doubly affected Black, who also works as an artist manager. He said the social distancing regulations have hit his clients hard. ""There's a lot of stress,"" he said. ""There's a lot of anxiety and fear."" Black said while larger artists in metropolitan areas may be better placed to ride out the downturn, regionally-based artists were living ""week to week"".   ""A lot of them are having to come up with other strategies,"" he said. ""They may have to look for other work, they may have to look at doing some smaller house concerts and other avenues they haven't considered before. ""We're hoping some of the smaller venues will still run events on a smaller level, but it depends if they can sustain their trading or not."" Contemporary pianist and composer Fiona Joy Hawkins is turning to technology while COVID-19 keeps her off the road. She is planning two Facebook Live concerts that she will stream from her home at Kendall on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. ""I'll do them as if they're a scheduled concert and they'll go all over the world,"" she said.   ""People will be able to tune in, and that way at least they're getting music in their homes. ""It's not quite the same, but certainly in the short term it solves a lot of problems and it's something we need to think about doing."" Hawkins is not charging for her concert, but hopes it will lead people to support her in the long run.   ""Right now I'm not actually thinking about (making money),"" she said. ""I think ultimately you need to send people to other places [where] they might be able to listen to your music.""   The venues artists normally perform in are also looking for new ways to source income during the social distancing measures.   In Coffs Harbour, Harry Barry is thinking outside the square. Mr Barry is the director of the North Coast Hotel Group, which owns seven pubs, including the Hoey Moey, which is renowned for its live music. ""We're effectively going to try and trade with less than a hundred people in a venue that's used to feeding tens of thousands of people a week,"" he said.   Mr Barry is exploring expanding the pub bistro business into takeaway and home delivery, and is weighing up a change of tactics for the bottle shop. ""We have to focus on our bottle shops being not just bottle shops anymore,"" he said. ""We are actively trying to source other staples such as bread, milk, rice, flour and anything else our customers are demanding — our bottle shops will become corner stores effectively."" In Wagga Wagga, Eastern Riverina Arts director Tim Kurylowicz is urging councils to roll over all funding for cancelled events into next financial year. Mr Kurylowicz said one event coordinator lost eight contracts, worth $30,000, in the last two days. ""Another has had five major events right across our region postponed,"" he said.

""The escalating spread of the coronavirus throughout Europe and the restrictions put in place by many governments … make it impossible for us to host a live event as planned.""

The live music sector is also facing an uncertain future. And where the NRL has salaried employees, a $1.8 billion broadcast deal and a profit of $30 million for the 2019 season, the live music sector — which employs 65,000 people and helps generate $15 billion, according to a recent parliamentary report — is a gig economy.

At the best of times, major events like Bluesfest and Splendour in the Grass — now cancelled and postponed, respectively — operate under enormous financial risk.

The Minister, Paul Fletcher, heard from 20 industry representatives on Tuesday, including the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), performing arts companies and representatives from peak body Live Performance Australia. Speaking after the meeting, he said coronavirus presented ""significant issues"" for arts organisations and he was there to listen. Live Performance Australia executive director Evelyn Richardson said the coronavirus shutdown would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. ""This is a much longer timeframe than I think people were preparing for — we're planning for four to six months' closure, this is not just four weeks,"" she said. She called for a targeted and immediate support and stimulus package of $850 million to keep people in jobs. ""We're seeing our industry hitting the wall and we need a cultural package,"" she said.  ""It could be part of a broader culture, entertainment and tourism package."" The social distancing introduced to quell the spread of coronavirus — including government bans on gatherings of more than 500 people — has led to a virtual complete shutdown of the live entertainment industry. The industry turned over $2.2 billion last year, not including pubs and clubs.   Music festival Splendour in the Grass is one of the latest major events affected by the outbreak, announcing it would be postponed from July to October.  Many other festivals scheduled in coming months have been cancelled, including Vivid, the Sydney Writers' Festival, Bluesfest, the Other Art Fair and Melbourne International Comedy Festival. For the first time, Melbourne's Art Centre is dark for at least a month and the Sydney Opera House turned off its lights on Monday. Some museums, libraries and galleries have this week announced month-long closures.  Cinemas are still operating for now, but the release of studio films such as the new James Bond have been delayed. In the local screen production sector, work has been frozen on the two biggest movies underway — Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic and Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, after both productions were touched by coronavirus.

The Australian Festival Association, an industry peak body, initiated a campaign to track industry losses.    In just three days, self-reporting on the 'I Lost My Gig' website has recorded $100 million in income lost by small-to-medium businesses and independent contractors, who had 350,000 individual gigs cancelled across the creative industries.  Live Performance Australia conservatively estimates 190,000 people have lost work. One of them is Melbourne comedian and father of two, Josh Earl, one of 500 performers forced to cancel their Melbourne comedy festival shows. Earl was set to earn more than $30,000 for 22 gigs, after $13,000 in costs for room hire and marketing. Earl generates enough income from his paid podcast Don't You Know Who I Am and writes one day a week with Channel Ten's The Project, but he's unsure how he will cover the rest of his family's expenses.   He cannot fall back on his part time job at the State Library of Victoria because that has closed as well.

He's also among the 500 performers who have had to cancel Melbourne comedy festival gigs. That bushfire fundraiser was the last in a series of more than 22 disaster relief events staged around the nation by the comedy sector.

The Minister, Paul Fletcher, heard from 20 industry representatives on Tuesday, including the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), performing arts companies and representatives from peak body Live Performance Australia. Speaking after the meeting, he said coronavirus presented ""significant issues"" for arts organisations and he was there to listen. Live Performance Australia executive director Evelyn Richardson said the coronavirus shutdown would cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. ""This is a much longer timeframe than I think people were preparing for — we're planning for four to six months' closure, this is not just four weeks,"" she said. She called for a targeted and immediate support and stimulus package of $850 million to keep people in jobs. ""We're seeing our industry hitting the wall and we need a cultural package,"" she said.  ""It could be part of a broader culture, entertainment and tourism package."" The social distancing introduced to quell the spread of coronavirus — including government bans on gatherings of more than 500 people — has led to a virtual complete shutdown of the live entertainment industry. The industry turned over $2.2 billion last year, not including pubs and clubs.   Music festival Splendour in the Grass is one of the latest major events affected by the outbreak, announcing it would be postponed from July to October.  Many other festivals scheduled in coming months have been cancelled, including Vivid, the Sydney Writers' Festival, Bluesfest, the Other Art Fair and Melbourne International Comedy Festival. For the first time, Melbourne's Art Centre is dark for at least a month and the Sydney Opera House turned off its lights on Monday. Some museums, libraries and galleries have this week announced month-long closures.  Cinemas are still operating for now, but the release of studio films such as the new James Bond have been delayed. In the local screen production sector, work has been frozen on the two biggest movies underway — Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic and Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, after both productions were touched by coronavirus. Tom Hanks is in isolation but no longer in hospital after testing positive last week, while Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton was in isolation while awaiting test results.

""Couch Choir"" has been organised to replace Pub Choir events that have been cancelled because of the disease. Pub Choir started in Brisbane in 2017, and was created by music teacher and event director Astrid Jorgensen who tried to find a way to get her old friends together for a singalong.   It turned into a phenomenon and every month has attracted hundreds of strangers to come together and learn low, medium and high harmonies to record a popular song. Ms Jorgensen said the widespread ban of events meant more than 12,000 tickets for Pub Choir events had been cancelled. She said the couch event was born out of her own self-isolation measures after returning from the United States. ""I was feeling a bit down because I can't sing with other people in the way I want to,"" Ms Jorgensen said. ""There's so many people feeling isolated at the moment — it's really sad. ""It got me thinking — our singing voices still work. ""It's just we can't be near each other, and Couch Choir is a solution to that.""   For the Couch Choir event, three videos of different harmonies will be released tonight with participants encouraged to record themselves singing at home.  On Thursday, the videos will be collected and mixed together into a video that will be released at a later date.  Ms Jorgensen was in the United States recently to conduct Pub Choir events at the annual South By Southwest (SXSW) music festival in Austin, Texas.   But the fast-changing situation in the US forced the cancellation of the events. Ms Jorgensen said she drove six hours to Los Angeles airport to catch a fight home, arriving back in Australia on Sunday. ""We were so concerned about getting home,"" she said. ""To be in the United States in the last 48 hours … it felt like things were very quickly getting out of hand."" Ms Jorgensen said she has been tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the results. ""I will never take for granted again the safety of home in Australia and how good it is here.""      ",By Mark Zita,"March 17, 2020"

It is the highest increase in new cases in the state in a single day. The Health Minister Brad Hazzard said it was likely there would be an exponential increase in coronavirus cases in the next few weeks. It comes as RSL NSW announced it had cancelled all public Anzac Day commemoration services, saying the risk to the public was ""too great"". ""Given the significant concerns around the spread of COVID-19, we simply cannot allow such large gatherings as we see each year on Anzac Day to go ahead,"" acting RSL NSW state president Ray James said. Racing NSW has also announced this Saturday's $3.5 million Golden Slipper at Rosehill Gardens in Western Sydney will be run behind closed doors.   Mr Hazzard said 67 of NSW's cases were acquired overseas, while 44 cases were transmitted within Australia. He said it was still unknown how 17 cases contracted the virus. Mr Hazzard said the infection rate was still low, given more than 25,000 tests had been conducted. ""So I would remind the community of the importance of being with us in partnership in trying to minimise the virus, but also understand that the number of people who are being impacted are still relatively small compared to the total number of tests and the broader population,"" he said. He said authorities were trying to contact people on Qantas flight QF-8 that arrived in Sydney from Dallas on March 11, and Virgin Flight VA-2 that arrived in Sydney from Los Angeles, also on March 11.   NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant also said there were six confirmed cases of coronavirus among guests who attended a wedding at Tumbling Waters Retreat at Stanwell Tops on March 6. The owner of the wedding venue said she had not been contacted by NSW Health.  Sonya Keller said she was unaware until earlier today when the bride contacted her by text to say some of the guests had tested positive. ""[She] said we should have surely been contacted by NSW Health if there was an issue … nothing at all,"" she said. ""Well as far as I know, all of my staff are well and of course, we are concerned, like everybody. ""It's an unknown thing and now we can take measures now that we know about it."" Dr Chant said it was important that only people with symptoms who had recently returned from overseas be tested for coronavirus. ""If we're swamped with a lot of testing which is of low value, low yield, it actually means that there could be delays for us finding these cases, that are actually putting the community at risk,"" she said. Earlier, the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said police would force people to stay at home if they did not voluntarily comply with Australia's new coronavirus self-isolation rules. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said anyone returning to Australia from overseas would be required to self-isolate for two weeks. The policy came into effect at midnight, and this morning, Ms Berejiklian confirmed police would target anyone flouting the crackdown. ""We do have that provision. We'll be enacting that,"" she said. ""We can't pretend that these are normal circumstances, because they're not. ""We can't pretend that it is business as usual, because it's not.""   Ms Berejiklian also encouraged people to let authorities know if they saw others refusing to self-isolate. ""People should report these cases of people turning up to work when they shouldn't,"" she said. ""If they're engaging in community and social life and they shouldn't, let us know. This morning special state powers were enacted to force organisers and corporations to obey a ban on public gatherings of 500 people or more.  Mr Hazzard said people who failed to comply with the new laws could face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to $11,000. Corporations would face larger fines, Mr Hazzard's office said in a statement. While large gatherings are banned, schools and universities will remain open.

41,/news/2020-03-15/rocks-bands-turn-to-childrens-entertainment/12027620,From the mosh pit to the sandpit: Why kids' albums are the new rock 'n' roll,"Maybe we should blame The Wiggles.   On the surface, the trend of pop and rock artists swapping pubs for playgrounds to find new audiences seemingly stems from The Cockroaches morphing into The Wiggles in 1991. But the trend of chart-topping acts switching to child-friendly entertainers predates The Wiggles. For example, 1989 ARIA Award nominees for best children's album included Darryl Cotton of 1960s Aussie rock royalty Zoot, and John Schumann of folk-rockers Redgum.   With more rock and pop acts trading the moshpit for the sandpit with a kids' record, is this another sign of rapid change in the music industry and the need for artists to diversify to make a living? Or is the world of kids' music getting cooler, to the delight of parents? The growing generational crossover is artfully demonstrated by dance-rock veterans Regurgitator, who took their genre-melding music to the top of the ARIA charts and even into a ""bubble"" in Melbourne's Federation Square. When they produced a kids' album last year, it wasn't too surprising to many fans. Bassist/vocalist Ben Ely said the genesis for Regurgitator's Pogogo Show and their release The Really Really Really Really Boring Album came from an invitation to play at Dress Up Attack, a Sydney festival created for parents to take kids to see rock bands including Custard and The Grates.    The band took the opportunity to play some of the songs Ely had written with his now-teenage daughters. Mostly amusingly for the grown-ups, Regurgitator re-worked some of their risque material for the G-rated crowd, spawning a version of one of their best-known songs, renamed I Sucked A Lollipop To Get Where I Am. ""It went down really well and felt quite natural for us because Regurgitator is a bit playful in a lot of ways,"" Ely said. He said he sees Regurgitator's Pogogo Show as ""a casual/part-time job that we do occasionally that we enjoy"". ""I don't think we could be kids entertainers full time like The Wiggles or something like that,"" Ely said. ""[But] it's actually quite nice and suits us at our age, especially with the fact that we have kids."" The nominees for best children's album at the 2016 ARIAs were the usual suspects — The Wiggles, Justine Clarke, Play School, and former Yellow Wiggle Sam Moran. The Play School album was notable for featuring several rock acts and pop stars singing nursery rhymes, but it was the fifth name on the nominee list that really raised eyebrows - Pat Davern of chart-topping alternative rockers Grinspoon. Since forming in 1995, Grinspoon has become well-known for their mix of heavy metal, alt-rock and punk-influenced sounds.   For his kids' record Alexander the Elephant in Zanzibar, Davern set aside the distortion pedals, minor keys and squally guitars to bring to life stories his father created. ""He used to make up these stories called Alexander the Elephant to tell to his grandchildren: my nieces and nephews,"" Davern said. ""I said to him, 'how would you feel if I made a musical record (about Alexander)?'... so it was a tribute to my dad."" The album became a kids' book, too, and Davern said the whole exercise was about flexing different creative muscles. He is one of many Aussie musicians who has a ""day job"" outside music, but he said the project was definitely not about diversifying his musical income streams. ""I was under no illusion it was going to make me any money ... would have been nice if it had,"" he laughed. ""It was more just to do something different. It's a bit of a legacy item (for my kids). 'Your dad wrote a children's musical that ended up being a book', which is kind of cool.""   Folk-pop group The Little Stevies were mildly successful, regularly touring Europe and releasing several well-received albums after being ""unearthed"" by triple j in the mid-2000s. But the band, led by sisters Sibylla and Beth Stephen, have enjoyed even greater success as child-friendly project The Teeny Tiny Stevies, spawned out of necessity in 2015. ""(Sibylla) got pregnant with her first child and, looking into the future we thought it wasn't going to work to keep pursuing the overseas path, where you need to go back and back and back, so we diversified,"" Beth said. ""We considered going into musical comedy, which is hilarious because I'm not particularly funny."" The siblings settled on children's music for their new avenue, partly inspired by Sibylla's impending motherhood, and approached the project like a start-up company, Sibylla explained.   ""It was our manager, who happens to be my partner as well, who got real with us and (said) 'you can't keep going overseas every year so ... how are you going to keep being musicians?',"" Sibylla said. ""The Little Stevies were at a point where it was a bit confusing. We'd had a band member leave who was a founding band member, and I was unsure whether we'd make another album again, and I was pregnant, and I freaked out.  ""I was like 'who am I? I've amounted to nothing! And I'm pregnant!'.  ""So for me, when I had my baby I worked so hard to basically just make something of myself. I was thrilled when Teeny Tiny Stevies (took off). I was like 'thank god, I'm amounting to something to show my kids'.""   The Teeny Tiny Stevies is definitely working. Animated versions of their songs appear regularly on ABC Kids, their second album was nominated for an ARIA and they sell out shows around the country. ""(The Teeny Tiny Stevies) are so much more famous than us,"" Beth laughed. They say the success has been built on the ""usefulness"" of their songs, which focus on everything from toilet training to getting dressed. The first album Useful Songs For Little People was inspired by the challenges Sibylla faced with her first child, while the subject matter for subsequent albums has been crowd-sourced from their fans. ""(The music is) literally inspired by what parents are going through,"" Sibylla said. Regurgitator's Ely says the benefits of children's entertainment are two-fold: relief from the rock-star lifestyle, and another income stream. ""We're getting older and doing rock shows where you go on stage at midnight and you get off at 1:30am and then you pack up ... and get back to the hotel by 3:30am and you've got to get up and fly at 7:00am (is harder than) doing these kids' shows where you go to a nice festival and play at 11 o'clock in the morning then it's over and you're in bed at a decent hour,"" he said.  Diversification, he muses, is par for the course for artists in Australia. Ely is a visual artist and creates music for theatre while fellow Regurgitator frontman Quan Yeomans writes music for cartoons. ""If you're an artist, especially in Australia, in any medium ... you do work in a lot of different art forms just to stay afloat,"" Ely said. ""The audience in Australia is not huge and you can't tour constantly, so you do have to diversify and do different things.""  As for the material itself, Ely said The Pogogo Show is ""catering to parents who aren't so precious"". ""A lot of children's entertainment ... cutesifies things and we try to make our content a little bit naughtier and a little bit more upfront,"" he said. ""We kind of encourage bad behaviour in some ways - we're the bad boys of kids' rock. Ha ha, that sounds so weird.""",ABC South West Vic      By Matt Neal,"March 15, 2020"

The Play School album was notable for featuring several rock acts and pop stars singing nursery rhymes, but it was the fifth name on the nominee list that really raised eyebrows - Pat Davern of chart-topping alternative rockers Grinspoon. Since forming in 1995, Grinspoon has become well-known for their mix of heavy metal, alt-rock and punk-influenced sounds.   For his kids' record Alexander the Elephant in Zanzibar, Davern set aside the distortion pedals, minor keys and squally guitars to bring to life stories his father created. ""He used to make up these stories called Alexander the Elephant to tell to his grandchildren: my nieces and nephews,"" Davern said. ""I said to him, 'how would you feel if I made a musical record (about Alexander)?'... so it was a tribute to my dad."" The album became a kids' book, too, and Davern said the whole exercise was about flexing different creative muscles. He is one of many Aussie musicians who has a ""day job"" outside music, but he said the project was definitely not about diversifying his musical income streams. ""I was under no illusion it was going to make me any money ... would have been nice if it had,"" he laughed. ""It was more just to do something different. It's a bit of a legacy item (for my kids). 'Your dad wrote a children's musical that ended up being a book', which is kind of cool.""   Folk-pop group The Little Stevies were mildly successful, regularly touring Europe and releasing several well-received albums after being ""unearthed"" by triple j in the mid-2000s. But the band, led by sisters Sibylla and Beth Stephen, have enjoyed even greater success as child-friendly project The Teeny Tiny Stevies, spawned out of necessity in 2015. ""(Sibylla) got pregnant with her first child and, looking into the future we thought it wasn't going to work to keep pursuing the overseas path, where you need to go back and back and back, so we diversified,"" Beth said. ""We considered going into musical comedy, which is hilarious because I'm not particularly funny."" The siblings settled on children's music for their new avenue, partly inspired by Sibylla's impending motherhood, and approached the project like a start-up company, Sibylla explained.   ""It was our manager, who happens to be my partner as well, who got real with us and (said) 'you can't keep going overseas every year so ... how are you going to keep being musicians?',"" Sibylla said. ""The Little Stevies were at a point where it was a bit confusing. We'd had a band member leave who was a founding band member, and I was unsure whether we'd make another album again, and I was pregnant, and I freaked out.  ""I was like 'who am I? I've amounted to nothing! And I'm pregnant!'.  ""So for me, when I had my baby I worked so hard to basically just make something of myself. I was thrilled when Teeny Tiny Stevies (took off). I was like 'thank god, I'm amounting to something to show my kids'.""   The Teeny Tiny Stevies is definitely working. Animated versions of their songs appear regularly on ABC Kids, their second album was nominated for an ARIA and they sell out shows around the country. ""(The Teeny Tiny Stevies) are so much more famous than us,"" Beth laughed. They say the success has been built on the ""usefulness"" of their songs, which focus on everything from toilet training to getting dressed. The first album Useful Songs For Little People was inspired by the challenges Sibylla faced with her first child, while the subject matter for subsequent albums has been crowd-sourced from their fans. ""(The music is) literally inspired by what parents are going through,"" Sibylla said. Regurgitator's Ely says the benefits of children's entertainment are two-fold: relief from the rock-star lifestyle, and another income stream. ""We're getting older and doing rock shows where you go on stage at midnight and you get off at 1:30am and then you pack up ... and get back to the hotel by 3:30am and you've got to get up and fly at 7:00am (is harder than) doing these kids' shows where you go to a nice festival and play at 11 o'clock in the morning then it's over and you're in bed at a decent hour,"" he said.  Diversification, he muses, is par for the course for artists in Australia. Ely is a visual artist and creates music for theatre while fellow Regurgitator frontman Quan Yeomans writes music for cartoons. ""If you're an artist, especially in Australia, in any medium ... you do work in a lot of different art forms just to stay afloat,"" Ely said. ""The audience in Australia is not huge and you can't tour constantly, so you do have to diversify and do different things.""  As for the material itself, Ely said The Pogogo Show is ""catering to parents who aren't so precious"". ""A lot of children's entertainment ... cutesifies things and we try to make our content a little bit naughtier and a little bit more upfront,"" he said. ""We kind of encourage bad behaviour in some ways - we're the bad boys of kids' rock. Ha ha, that sounds so weird.""",ABC South West Vic      By Matt Neal,"March 15, 2020"
43,/news/2020-03-15/arts-entertainment-industry-thrown-into-turmoil-by-coronavirus/12057082,Australia's arts and entertainment industry thrown into turmoil by coronavirus crowd restrictions,"Australians working in the arts industry have reported more than $25 million in lost income caused by bushfires and coronavirus, less than a day after the industry started calculating losses.   Major events across Australia have been cancelled because of the pandemic, including Sydney's Vivid Festival and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. From Monday, the Federal Government is advising all events with crowds of 500 or more people be cancelled. The Australian Music Industry Network and Australian Festivals Association launched a website on Saturday, which allows people in the arts to record the work and income they have lost. The chair of the Australian Music Industry Network, Emily Collins, said the data was only capturing confirmed work that had already been cancelled, and not future losses, or work artists might normally have expected to pick up.   ""A lot of people are talking about, you know, they have lost this much — maybe it is $20,000 on a US tour that has been cancelled in the last week and they are looking down the barrel of having no work for the next six months, possibly more,"" Ms Collins said. She said it was at the stage where industry bodies were concerned about artists and workers in the arts, who usually work on casual contracts or as freelancers, being able to pay for their housing and basic needs. Ms Collins said the survey heard from an events contractor who worked for a company that had cancelled all upcoming work. ""So he has lost any future work for the next three months and his two sons have also lost their work because they work in a similar industry, so there are three people from one household who have lost all income,"" she said. Ms Collins said the industry would be likely to request specific arts and entertainment assistance from the Federal Government, to help workers through the pandemic. ""To make sure the creatives — the people who bring life and colour to our lives — that they don't go under,"" she said. The Federal Arts Minister, Paul Fletcher, will host a roundtable discussion with industry representatives via teleconference on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus impacts and Government responses for the creative and cultural sectors. ""I want to hear about the circumstances the arts is facing and to discuss assistance available, including the Government's recently announced cash flow assistance for businesses,"" he said. Xani Kolac is a violinist on the musical Come From Away, which has decided to end its theatre season in Melbourne early due to the crowd restrictions.   ""I'm so gutted,"" Ms Kolac said.   ""It's been a really, really tragic and scary, stressful week for all the artists and musicians around the world."" It is not the only work that she has lost in the last week. ""All of my gigs up until May have been cancelled,"" Ms Kolac said. Despite this, Ms Kolac said she supports the Federal Government's decision to crack down on crowds to stop the spread of coronavirus. ""I think the health and safety of all the public and artists involved is important,"" she said. ""I think they've made the right call but we're all in a bad spot.""   The entertainment industry's union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA), is warning that those losing jobs as a result of the mass event cancellations are especially vulnerable workers, with two-thirds of them casually employed or freelancers. That is double the rate of the larger Australian population. ""The vast majority of these workers are casual,"" the MEAA's Victorian director Adam Portelli said. ""That means they have no paid leave. And come Monday, shifts will be cancelled."" It is not just artists and musicians that have lost work but all sorts of support workers behind the scenes, including tech crews, roadies, road managers, venue managers and bar staff.   Melbourne sound technician Bonnie Knight is a sound technician who has already lost weeks of work. ""The tour I was on just got cancelled. I've had the entirety of my next work of week cancelled,"" she said. ""Both venues I work at are at over 1,000 capacity and it's unclear when they'll go back. It's months' worth of work that's uncertain.   ""It's really stressful. I'd never felt the wrath of being a freelancer because I've always had a lot of different things on the go but now the entirety of it is gone away in one day. ""I feel lucky because I have savings because I had a plan to move overseas in August.  ""I don't think I'll be able to do that anymore which is heartbreaking but it means I have money. ""But pretty much everybody else I know lives gig to gig.""   Ms Knight called on the Federal Government to fund basic minimum wages for people in her industry. ""If they can do temporary basic wage, that would be great."" Mr Portelli said the industry was going to be devastated. ""Already we're hearing of shifts being cancelled. We'd ask employers to reconsider seriously if these shifts need to be cancelled or if workers can be deployed elsewhere,"" he said. ""And if they have to be cancelled, to look at doing the right thing, supporting those casuals and paying them for the period of time they can't be employed at the venue."" The MEAA is calling on the Federal Government to create a stimulus package specifically for the entertainment industry. ""These are the same workers that only months ago were doing free work for bushfire appeals for the rest of the country,"" Mr Portelli said.   Many companies and bands have already lost money due to last-minute concert cancellations. Lorrae McKenna is a band manager for Melbourne group RVG, who were halfway through supporting The Pixies when that Australian tour was cancelled this week. Another of Ms McKenna's bands, Good Morning, was halfway through a US tour when it was cancelled, too.  ""We've lost definitely thousands and thousands of dollars already in travel costs but it could be more,"" Ms McKenna. ""We don't know how much money we'll lose because I don't know when my bands can tour again. They don't know when they can tour again. it's very uncertain. ""It's been a quick slope into a lot of very dramatic changes to our industry."" Even secondary companies that make merchandise for the industry have come to a standstill. Tim Everist runs a Melbourne company that has the contract to make t-shirts for Australian rock band Tame Impala's looming tour in April. As yet, Tame Impala has not cancelled, but it is unclear how long the crowd restrictions will be in place. ""It's just a really surreal time to be in business,"" Mr Everist said. ""Not knowing what's going to happen.""   Some companies are wrangling to keep the industry churning. Ms McKenna said consumer support was paramount to keep the industry going at this tough time. ""If you've listened to a band for a long time but you haven't bought their record, go buy it,"" she said. ""And getting out to the smaller gigs that are still happening is important. ""We can't let that part of the industry suffer.""  ",By Emilia Terzon,"April 06, 2020"

The track, a piece of psychedelic pop released in 2015 by multi-instrumentalist Kevin Parker's musical project, beat out songs by Angus & Julia Stone, Kanye West, Sia and others to be crowned the favourite of the last 10 years. Other songs in the top 10 included Somebody That I Used To Know (feat. Kimbra) by Australian singer Gotye at number two, Do I Wanna Know? by Arctic Monkeys at three, Covered In Chrome by Violent Soho at four and Innerbloom by RUFUS DU SOL at five. Foster The People, Gang of Youths, Flume, Matt Corby and Angus & Julia Stone also featured high in the list. The station received more than 1.8 million votes for songs released between 2010 and the end of 2019. Just under half the voters were aged 18 to 24. Speaking to triple j after his song made it to the top spot, Parker said that, ""if I am being honest"", he had a feeling it would win. ""It's a song that has hung around for long enough,"" he said. ""It's like the little song that could. ""I think it has aged well."" Tame Impala have had 11 entries in the Hottest 100 over the years, but this the first number one. ""I can't describe how much of a big thing that is to me,"" Parker said.   Of the 100 artists, 49 were Australian, including eight of the top 10, while 2012 releases featured more often than songs from other years. All the tracks that won the station's annual countdown, including Gotye's and Flume's, made it into the decade list: Meanwhile, a few songs that never charted in an annual list featured on Saturday, including the anthemic Rolling In The Deep by British singer Adele. That came in at number 97 and marked the first time Adele had appeared in a Hottest 100. Flume, Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar were among the artists to land more than one song in the 100. When we asked the ABC News Messenger audience last week what they thought might win, Royals by Kiwi singer Lorde, which hit number one in the US Billboard charts when it was released widely in 2013, was a common pick. But it wasn't to be. It instead came in at number 16, prompting a pretty common refrain:   On the phone from her native New Zealand, Lorde, aka Ella Yelich-O'Connor, told triple j she looked back fondly on the period when the song made her a global sensation. ""I was 16 to 18, which is such a pivotal time in everyone's lives,"" she said. ""Mine was going to the Grammys, seeing all this crazy stuff and the world being at my feet in this really exciting way. That will always be indelibly planted in my memory."" Runaway (feat. Pusha T) by Kanye West was also tipped to be a contender for number one, but no luck either for the US rapper, whose song hit number 14.   Innerbloom by Australian band RUFUS DU SOL came in at number five, despite not having made it into the Hottest 100 at the time of its release. The track, which runs past nine minutes, has since taken on a special significance for the station's audience, to the point where even the Flume remix of the track made it into the decade countdown, at number 64.

He is part of the Adelaide Fringe's street performers program that puts buskers on show from the city's bustling east end to the challenging confines of the Central Market. But belting out his songs metres from the market toilets, cafes and a busy walkway does not faze the 36-year-old.

""It's that silence that's probably the hardest to get through so if I can fill that silence with something, that's what's completely turned my life around,"" he said.
