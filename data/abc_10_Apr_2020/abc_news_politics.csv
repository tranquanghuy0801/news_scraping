The week-long storm has destroyed homes, cut off power and killed dozens in four Pacific island countries. Local disaster teams in Vanuatu hope to reach some of the worst-affected areas today. Glen Craig from the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council estimates up to 90 per cent of homes in the country's second largest town, Luganville, have been damaged. ""It's worse than what we thought,"" he said. ""People here are positive. I think they're still a bit shell-shocked at the moment but they know that help is coming but help will need to come fast. ""Hopefully Australia and New Zealand military, especially, can start to mobilise — the airfield's fine for landing heavy aircraft.""   Aid groups predict Vanuatu's recovery could take more than 12 months. The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"", with fears the damage in some places has been worse than Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million — more than half of the country's annual GDP. Kendra Gates Derousseau, the country director at World Vision in Vanuatu, told the ABC damage she had seen in Luganville and video of Pentecost Island, ""indicate that the damage is significantly worse than tropical Cyclone Pam"". ""The body of Harold was smaller than Pam, so the damage is less expansive in terms of numbers of islands, but the islands that were hit — it almost looked like a tornado had ripped through Luganville,"" she said. ""Instead of things being wind-blown and toppled, they were literally torn to pieces.""    The ADF will deliver relief supplies such as blankets, lanterns, shelter and hygiene kits. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the assistance for Vanuatu was ""part of our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder during times of crisis."" Foreign Minister Marise Payne said there would likely be more assistance announced in the coming days. ""We are acutely conscious that this comes on top of the impact and difficulties created by COVID-19 for those countries and so our support is all the more important,"" Senator Payne said. New Zealand announced on Wednesday it would provide $480,000 to Vanuatu to help rebuild after the cyclone. According to Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, however, ""no foreign personnel are being brought to Vanuatu for response efforts at the present time"". ""This will be an internally run operation,"" it said. Any crew unloading supplies would wear protective gear and remain on the runway, authorities said.   The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, severely damaged tourist resorts in Tonga yesterday.   Local police reported three tourist resorts north of the capital, Nukualofa, had been virtually flattened. Damage caused by Harold in Fiji, meanwhile, was worse than anticipated, the Red Cross told the ABC. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said the country was ""hit hard"" but that he was ""still waiting for the full damage report"". Flooding caused by the cyclone continues to affect much of the country. A tornado flipped the roof off a local college, Mr Bainimarama said in a message posted to Twitter. ""We've been through many cyclones before, even stronger than Harold. We always bounce back."" At least 27 people were killed in the Solomon Islands during the storm after they were swept off a ferry. Australia has already provided support to the Solomon Islands and has offered assistance to Fiji and Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide further help to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" Senator Payne said. ""It will be some time before the full impact of this disaster is known.""   Pacific nations have implemented measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite having relatively few reported cases.   While Vanuatu has not confirmed any cases of COVID-19, there are concerns the relief effort could compromise the vulnerable nation.  ""Foreign-donated humanitarian supplies, which have initially come from our partners from Australia, New Zealand and France, are being handled to strict health protocols to negate any risk of COVID-19 coming to Vanuatu,"" a statement said. Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu had no intensive care beds and that if coronavirus hit, ""it would have the potential to devastate the population"".   Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Wednesday agreed to establish a Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19, which it said would allow for assistance to be expedited and distributed equitably among member countries. Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, said coronavirus ""poses a real and extreme danger to the health and security of the Pacific peoples"". ""Never before has the full forum membership simultaneously been in crisis.""   The European Union, meanwhile, announced 119 million euros ($205 million) to assist Pacific nations to strengthen their health, water and sanitation systems in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ''The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge of our time,"" EU ambassador for the Pacific, H.E. Sujiro Seam, said.   Fijian authorities have urged parents to keep their children indoors. ""Even though the cyclone has passed, the threat of floods is still present and we still need you to stay home because of COVID-19"", a statement said. Observers fear cyclone relief efforts will be further compounded by the economic consequences of COVID-19 social distancing measures. Ms Gates Derousseau said tourism was 40 per cent of Vanuatu's budget, and was ""unlikely to come back anytime soon"". Australian National University development economist Christopher Hoy told the ABC countries in the region such as Tonga and Samoa were already suffering from severe debt distress.",Pacific Beat      By Max Walden and Catherine Graue,"April 10, 2020"

The Nepali national loves Australia's education system, career opportunities and lifestyle, but chief among his reasons for living and working in the ""lucky country"" for the past seven years is that everyone is treated equally. ""My boss or my manager, I still can put my opinions to them, and that's what really drove me to come to Australia,"" Mr Bhattarai said. From the end of this month, Mr Bhattarai will be without any source of income because of the coronavirus pandemic's impact on his tourist-dependent job. Mr Bhattarai is on a foreign visa, meaning he is ineligible for a share in the $130 billion in wage support that passed both houses of the Federal Parliament this week.   The Hobart resident applied for permanent residency two years ago but he is yet to learn whether he has been successful. ""There are people like me who want to contribute to the economy, who are looking forward to the development of themselves and the community as they have been here for so many years,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""We want to help Australia, we want to help create a good version of Australia … and I would request that the Government not put everyone in the same basket."" The Tasmanian Government has worked hard to attract overseas residents to help boost the ageing population and fill gaps in the workforce. The entire state is classed regional, which can help a person's case in applying to become a permanent resident. The Greens tried to amend the Federal Government's JobKeeper package in Parliament on Wednesday to include income support for temporary migrants. Tasmanian Senator Nick McKim said: ""Tasmania has a significant number of foreign workers, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and cultural sectors. ""Some business owners are doing their best to look after temporary visa holders with no income, but that should be the Government's job."" People on temporary visas are also ineligible for the JobSeeker payment.   Tasmanian state MP Madeleine Ogilvie described the situation as a ""crisis"", with staff in her office in Hobart's northern suburbs working around the clock to provide support to people like Mr Bhattarai. ""The reality is that we've invited these people here to come study with us, come work with us, come help us and be part of the community, and now things have gotten to a very, very bad stage,"" Ms Ogilvie said. ""At the moment, I don't believe that we as a country and as a state are living up to what we've offered them."" Unions Tasmania has been similarly flooded with calls from people on temporary visas unsure how they will survive without a stable income. ""They pay tax while they're here, they make a contribution, and whilst many of them are not going to be here forever, lots are building their lives here, they're building their home,"" secretary Jessica Munday said. ""We're literally talking about forcing people into destitution and homelessness at a time when we're asking them to stay at home, isolate and stay safe.""   Tasmanian Council of Social Service acting chief executive Simone Zell said member organisations were supporting overseas workers with food and welfare checks. ""The Government is in a position to offer assistance to our migrant visa holders,"" Ms Zell said. ""These people are contributing to our communities and our local economies."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said earlier this week the Government tried to create the broadest and fairest possible JobKeeker scheme but had to ""draw the line somewhere"". The Federal Government will allow migrant workers to access up to $10,000 from their superannuation funds.   Diem Doan has been in Tasmania for about six months, describing it as ""one of the most beautiful states in Australia"". ""It's peaceful, the people here are friendly and lovely and nice, and that drew me,"" Ms Doan said from her Hobart home. ""Also, I want to get permanent residency for the long-term, and Tasmania offers state sponsorship."" After being stood down from her restaurant job, Ms Doan is unsure how she will continue to live in Australia — her home for the past six years.   Her family in Vietnam will provide some financial support, and she will continue to hunt for a new job, she said. ""I still have to go get groceries, I still have to pay for all the bills every month,"" Ms Doan said. ""Luckily my landlord reduced my rent for us, so that's a little support but it really means a lot to us."" Mr Bhattarai said Population Minister Alan Tudge's comment that people who could not afford to stay in Australia should go home was ""heartbreaking"". He and Ms Doan said they were not sure how they would even return to Asia given widespread lockdowns and a lack of flights. ""Australia is one of the countries that has taught me more than my home because I basically did my first job here, I studied my bachelor's here, I have my sisters and in-laws here,"" Mr Bhattarai said. ""I don't want to leave Australia because I still want to progress my career, and it's home."" Premier Peter Gutwein said the Tasmanian Government would provide support where it could.

2,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-sars-comparison-contagious-mortality-rate/12139122?section=politics,Coronavirus is less deadly than SARS and experts say that's why it's killed more people overall,"It's not the first virus to spread rapidly from country to country, nor is it the first to be declared a pandemic — but within weeks, people have lost jobs, and even their lives as a result of COVID-19. Governments around the world have scrambled to respond to the threat of coronavirus — despite the disease having a far lower mortality rate than other respiratory diseases like SARS or MERS. Here's why the world has been turned upside down due to COVID-19. There are obvious similarities between COVID-19 and the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which reached the public consciousness in early 2003. Both SARS and COVID-19 are types of coronavirus, and both are thought to have originated in a Chinese ""wet market"". But while SARS made its way to about 30 different countries before being contained, it infected just over 8,000 people and killed 774 by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the pandemic over in mid-2003. On its own, the figure is huge — but not when compared to COVID-19, which so far has resulted in more than 1.5 million recorded cases and 88,500 deaths.   SARS kills between 14 and 15 per cent of people it infects. We still don't know the exact death rate of COVID-19 as the data continues to come in, but the WHO has said initial figures indicate the crude mortality rate is between 3 and 4 per cent. So why has COVID-19 killed so many more people than SARS? According to Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert from the Australian National University's Medical School, it's partly due to the range of effects COVID-19 can have on people.   He said the trouble with the virus was it could go undetected because the majority of infected people experienced only mild symptoms. ""Perversely, when you have a disease like SARS that has a relatively high mortality rate, that actually spreads less because people notice it much quicker,"" Professor Collignon said. ""It's like Ebola — if you have a large percentage of the people who get it get very sick and die, before it spreads very far you know about it."" Associate professor of Medicine at ANU Sanjaya Senanayake said viruses like COVID-19 thrived by keeping humans alive. ""In fact, to be an effective virus it will want to keep its hosts alive so it can continue doing … its infecting,"" he said. When asked why COVID-19 had triggered such a strong response from governments around the world, Dr Senanayake said: ""It's highly infectious and none of us are immune.""   The other frightening issue, according to Stuart Tangye from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, is that many people are silent carriers who don't even know they have COVID-19 until it's too late.   ""Basically, there's a whole lot of healthy people out there who are carrying the virus, early on, who just didn't know they were spreading it around,"" Professor Tangye said. ""The Ruby Princess is a classic and tragic example. ""There were a couple of people on the boat who were symptomatic, they let everyone get off, and suddenly realised there were hundreds of people who were virus positive, taking the virus with them and spreading it around parts of the country and parts of the world.""   Professor Tangye said this was different to cases of SARS or Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) where people typically displayed symptoms when they were infectious. ""The onset of symptoms there very much came not long after infection, so you were sort of symptomatic and therefore isolated quickly,"" he said. We hear about the flu a lot in comparison to COVID-19. There are estimates that globally, influenza has caused as many as 646,000 deaths per year.   But Professor Tangye said there were three main things that separated influenza from COVID-19: herd immunity, vaccines and treatment — like antiviral medications which can sometimes shorten the duration of the flu. He said given COVID-19 did not yet have any of those things, people effectively had no protection from the highly infectious virus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is also thought to be higher than that of most strains of the flu.    ",By political reporter Stephanie Dalzell,"April 10, 2020"

The election has been scheduled for October 31 and Ms Palaszczuk said it would go ahead. ""It has to happen — we have to have a state election this year — there's no ifs or buts about it,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. The Attorney-General has been discussing options with the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ). ""One of the measures we'll be looking at is a full postal vote,"" Ms Palaszczuk said.     State breakdowns on coronavirus 'curve modelling' are expected from the Federal Government in the next two weeks and will help Ms Palaszczuk decide how the election will be held. A decision is expected in the next month. ""It depends on where we are in terms of the curve,"" Ms Palaszczuk said. ""Our initial predictions were that we were going to be in the peak around July, August, September. ""That would have been absolutely problematic being in a peak and asking people to go to a polling booth.""   Queensland's local government elections went ahead on March 28 but there was criticism that voters were being put at risk. It also saw a record number of people choosing to vote early by postal vote or by attending pre-polling stations.    ",By Matt Wordsworth,"April 10, 2020"
4,/news/2020-04-10/flu-season-with-coronavirus-could-mean-extended-lockdown-covid19/12136870?section=politics,A winter flu season means Australia's coronavirus lockdown could last for months,"Leading health experts believe the looming flu season means Australia's tough social-distancing laws will not be lifted for several months, despite the NSW Government considering easing of restrictions in May.   On Wednesday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said some restrictions on travel and personal contact would be reassessed every month. The number of COVID-19 infections has declined, but experts warned lifting the lockdown could spark an influenza outbreak. Last year in Australia, 812 people died from the flu. Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza said an influenza outbreak would further strain hospitals.   He warned schools, childcare centres and nursing homes were places influenza could spread quickly. ""If schools are fully opened again, we could see influenza spread back through schools and into the community,"" Professor Barr said. ""Similarly this could happen in aged care homes, which are currently in lockdown mode with reduced visits.""   Epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws, an advisor to WHO on the coronavirus crisis, said the threat of an influenza outbreak meant ""we are fighting a war on many fronts"". ""An influenza pandemic would not only put a surge of stress on GPs and hospitals, but it would cause a problem for rational testing of COVID-19,"" she said. Both viruses shared identical symptoms and would create a need for fairly healthy patients to be put through a battery of tests. She said the flood of tests would frustrate the real-time collection of coronavirus data and would delay any decision to end lockdowns. Levels of Influenza A — the most contagious and deadly type of flu — spiked in February and three serious outbreaks in aged care facilities took NSW Health authorities by surprise.   Any spread of Influenza A is tracked carefully by authorities and is the centre of global pandemics which kills millions of people every year. The Federal Government purchased a record 13.5 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines, at the coast of $80 million, to ensure free doses were widely available in 2020.   But Professor McLaws said it was not enough and that all 24.7 million Australians must be covered. ""You need 95 per cent of the population to get herd immunity,"" she said. ""We need to ramp up drive-in flu clinics to get the coverage we need."" The Australian Medical Association urged all Australian's to help prevent influenza spreading by scheduling a flu vaccination with their doctor. Kean Sing-Lim, president of AMA NSW, believed the winter flu preparations showed Australia was ""not out of harm's way"". He said evidence from the coronavirus outbreaks in Italy and China proved lockdowns needed to be enforced for several months to be effective. ""It's difficult to predict the severity of flu seasons ahead of time — we have to plan for the worst,"" he said.   A NSW Health spokesperson acknowledged the tough approach on coronavirus was ""effective prevention against influenza"" but would not speculate on future lockdown plans.  They said the Government was offering free flu vaccines to people over 65, young children, pregnant women, and Indigenous people through GPs. Dr Sing-Lim said physical-distancing laws in Australia were so far slowing the spread of infection. Yesterday, there were 2,733 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in NSW with 39 news cases added to the tally — the lowest daily count in the state since March 16. ""Everyone is adapting [and] adaption is the key to survival,"" Dr Sing-Lim. ""One weekend of parties and fun could put us back months — we just have to keep being boring.""

5,/news/2020-04-10/australians-pool-cash-for-coronavirus-flights-out-of-india/12138010?section=politics,"As coronavirus cases escalate in India, Australians pool their cash to arrange charter flights home","A group of expats and aviation experts have banded together to organise private charter flights to bring home hundreds of Australians stranded in India.   Some 1,300 Australians stuck in the country put their name to an email calling on Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne to help get them home. New Delhi resident and Australian expat Simon Quinn created a Facebook support group called Australians Stuck in India, which lobbied the Government for emergency flights.  ""I saw that lots of foreigners here were really struggling after the lockdown started,"" Mr Quinn told the ABC. ""People were afraid, there were horror stories of people being locked in hotel rooms.""   Mr Quinn speaks Hindi, which made the situation easier for him to handle.   ""But for the average tourist, this was a really scary time,"" he said.  India has entered the third week of a nationwide lockdown that prohibits interstate and international travel, as the country continues to try to curb the rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases.   ""People assume [Australians] hadn't heeded the calls from home,"" Mr Quinn said. ""The lockdown happened really fast. Even if people wanted to get out, they just couldn't."" As European countries started evacuating their citizens from India, Mr Quinn reached out to aviation experts.  He eventually contacted Brendon Hempel, a pilot of 25 years and managing director of an aircraft leasing company, Stratos Group Aviation.   Mr Hempel had already leased several Lion Air aircraft, which were transporting medical supplies from China to Australia, when he decided to help the stranded Aussies. Another Australian charter company, Monarc Global, also joined the cause and designed an online ticketing system specifically for the evacuation flights. ""People were tired of waiting for a solution to arrive, and we were able to back this operation privately,"" Mr Hempel said.   ""I know it's a difficult time for families who are scared of their security and wellbeing. ""I did actually see a video from an Australian in Delhi who was trapped essentially in his apartment, awaiting some sort of help from government to get out. That was really the passion in trying to help out."" The first flight is scheduled to leave on Saturday from Delhi to Melbourne, via Denpasar. Australians Chloe Dimopoulos and her partner Ben Munro, who spent more than 18 days stuck in a hospital in Jaipur, have tickets for the first flight out.    ""[We're] elated, absolutely stoked,"" Ms Dimopoulos said from her Delhi hotel room.   ""We were psyching in our heads that we were going to be here for months, the lockdown would be extended, it would be a nightmare."" The couple were put into quarantine in hospital after Ms Dimopoulos came down with a fever, but they were barred from leaving for weeks despite both testing negative twice for COVID-19. ""We were nervous that it still wasn't real until we were literally in the car,"" Mr Munro said.   ""When we were in the hospital we saw … that a lot of other countries were doing evacuation flights. We felt pretty left behind.""  Mr Munro said he was grateful the charter flight organisers came through.  ""I think it should not have been their responsibility,"" he added.  Organisers expect up to 10 flights can be scheduled from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but are concerned about how long this may take as authorities have requested each flight is staggered by three days to cope with the influx.   Tickets are likely to cost about $2,000, which is more than half what Australians paid for official emergency flights from Peru. The Australian High Commission in India has helped the rescue mission clear bureaucratic hurdles and arranged travel passes for people to travel to the airport during India's lockdown.   On April 9, Ms Payne said she had spoken with her Indian counterpart about organising a commercial flight to Australia. ""People think it's quite simple that you order charter flights,"" Mr Quinn said. ""But what people don't really understand [is] there's a lot of complex issues that Australia faced that other countries didn't."" The Australian Government has stopped short of ""endorsing"" the private charter flights, stating government officials and contractors have been instructed to not fly Lion Air until an investigation in a 2018 fatal crash is complete.   But Mr Hempel said he personally had no safety concerns about the airline. ""They're a large airline,"" Mr Hempel said. ""In this case, they've been extremely helpful and at the end of the day they're scrutinised by the [International Civil Aviation Organisation] and the same levels of organisation that Australian airliners are.""

6,/news/2020-04-10/coronavirus-enforcement-warning-for-easter-weekend/12138518?section=politics,Easter is 'the most important weekend' in Australia's coronavirus fight as police warn of fines,"On a crucial weekend for Australia's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, leaders have warned there will be no tolerance for breaches of strict self-isolation measures.   Australia's containment controls — including the mandatory quarantine of international visitors, closed state borders and fines for people being outside without a valid reason — have helped ""flatten the curve"" and resulted in fewer than 100 new cases in 24 hours for the first time in three weeks. But Health Minister Greg Hunt warned the Easter weekend was not a time to ease the restrictions. ""As we go into Easter with welcome news for Australia, the virus does not take a holiday, therefore none of us can relax what we do,"" he said. ""This, in many ways, is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus.  ""If we can lock in the gains that we've made as a nation through the courage and sacrifice of those on the health, medical and policing frontlines, but also through the immense goodwill and discipline of Australians, then we can help really protect Australian lives going forward and give ourselves the pathway through."" The restrictions will apply to visits to the beach, attending church services, going interstate or holding large family gatherings.     Each state and territory has announced its own penalties and fines for breaching the restrictions on gatherings of more than two people, except in specific circumstances. State governments have issued strong warnings that police will have helicopters in the air, patrols of holiday destinations and will be using numberplate technology this weekend to find people who are gathering in large groups or who are a long way from their homes.   It comes after several flagrant breaches of the restrictions — including 58 COVID-19 fines for a car rally south of Brisbane, a party at a Sunshine Coast hotel and a man escaping enforced self-isolation in a hotel in Perth and travelling around the city.   Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein warned ""the gloves [had] come off"", announcing a statewide blitz this weekend, including the use of helicopters and police visits to holiday shacks, after reports people were taking campers and trailers to the coast. ""We still have Tasmanians that are flouting the rules,"" he said. ""I have been fair, I have been reasonable and I have taken every step and every precaution that we can to save lives. But we will only save lives if Tasmanians follow the rules.   ""Today we'll be putting helicopters up. There will be eyes in the sky.""   Officers in Victoria will also be checking holiday destinations to enforce compliance, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said. ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you.""   Queensland has introduced a permit for residents returning to the state, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warning ""now is not the time to go into New South Wales"" and refusing to rule out stricter border controls. Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said there were still too many people trying to use beaches, which were closed to ""out-of-towners"". ""Last weekend, we had so many people descend onto the Gold Coast that those social-distancing measures were so extraordinarily difficult to enforce, people were still sunbaking, congregating, and this is what we want to avoid,"" she said. ""What we're saying is please can you just stay home for these next few weeks. You can still get out and do your exercise, but do it locally. New South Wales Arts Minister Don Harwin was forced to apologise and return to Sydney after being sprung at his Central Coast holiday house, despite bans on non-essential travel. The state has also announced $5,000 fines for people who deliberately spit or cough on frontline workers in response to reports of abuse and assault towards people in uniform.

7,/news/2020-04-10/the-rules-of-driving-during-coronavirus/12132208?section=politics,Can I drive under coronavirus restrictions? How many passengers? Answering your Easter weekend driving questions,"As the Easter weekend approaches, there is a great temptation to hit the road, but authorities have warned drivers to think carefully before grabbing their keys. Conscious of keeping coronavirus under control, police across the country have redoubled their efforts to crack down on non-essential travel. So what is essential? Can you drive to see a partner or a relative? What about a quick trip to a holiday home or for a leisurely cruise around town? Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings.

The television tradie's 15-month appointment to the role has been the subject of significant criticism after it was revealed he had only attended one public event and appeared in a handful of social media videos in his first few months as ambassador. Mr Cam hit out at questions about whether he was providing taxpayers with value for money, even telling one journalist his salary was ""none of your business"" in a live television interview. The coronavirus outbreak in Australia, and the associated social restrictions that have shut down workplaces and TAFE colleges, have now hampered his attempts to become more visible. ""The nature of the role of national careers ambassador has also changed with face-to-face events being cancelled,"" Employment Minister Michaelia Cash said in a statement. ""Mr Cam will continue to work with the Australian Government and the National Careers Institute to amplify online training opportunities and engage with Australians through digital mediums. ""As his role has fundamentally changed, Mr Cam has also volunteered to forego his remaining salary payments over the coming months.""   Cam was due to earn $262,000 between October 1, 2019, and the end of this financial year, with a further $85,000 paid from July 1 and the end of his appointment. He has been paid $175,000 so far, meaning he is giving up the remaining $172,000. Senator Cash had defended his appointment, arguing he was one of the most high-profile tradespeople in Australia and would bring considerable clout to the Federal Government's efforts to encourage the take up of apprenticeships.

9,/news/2020-04-09/coronvirus-early-release-superannuation-assistance-withdrawals/12137774?section=politics,"More than 600,000 Australians apply for early release of superannuation under coronavirus assistance scheme","Nearly 618,000 Australians have applied to get an early release of their superannuation under the Federal Government's plan to help people out of work and facing financial hardship during the coronavirus pandemic.   From April 20, the Morrison Government is allowing retrenched workers and those suffering financial hardship because of shutdowns to access up to $20,000 in super and take it out tax free. The first $10,000 is available between mid-April and July 1, and the second $10,000 is available after July 1 for about three months. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said as of midnight April 8, it had 617,800 registrations of interest, but could not yet estimate how many people would be eligible to draw down.  This figure is up from more than 360,000 it reported as of last Friday, and Australians are yet to be able to fill out the official form which allows them to apply from April 20.   To be eligible, people must be either unemployed or eligible for welfare support payments including the JobSeeker payment, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment, Special Benefit or Farm Household Allowance. The scheme is also on offer to those who have had their working hours reduced by 20 per cent or more, or sole traders whose business has been suspended or seen turnover fall by at least 20 per cent. While the Federal Government has estimated that Australians facing hardship will be repaid about $27 billion tax free from their super savings, Rice Warner has estimated the figure could be as high as $50 billion. The Government has repeatedly warned superannuation funds — which reap more than $30 billion annually in fees in Australia's $3 trillion sector — to act responsibly during this crisis. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had said super fund trustees should have managed their legal obligations responsibly over the years to ensure that they have ""appropriate liquidity"". He warned that if they do not regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) has a number of levers it can pull, including directing mergers in cases where a fund is unable to meet the needs of members.   There are longstanding clauses in superannuation fund product disclosure statements — which regularly get updated and have been recently revised for unique reasons unrelated to the government scheme — giving the funds discretion about whether to allow early withdrawals. The funds say these clauses are not new or exceptional, and that they plan to pay out their members.   But the fine print takes on a new meaning when hundreds of thousands of Australians are now applying for early withdrawals, and it remains to be seen if funds start exercising their discretion more aggressively. The $44 billion fund representing largely hospitality workers, Hostplus, said in a statement that it recently updated its product disclosure statement. This was to reflect a clause in Hostplus' trust deed that gives it ""a broad discretion to suspend or delay unit pricing in extraordinary situations to ensure equity, fairness and balance in investment pricing and transactions in the best interests of all members"". ""In Hostplus' case, this trustee power is not new,"" the statement said. ""It is not unique. It is not exceptional."" Hostplus' chief executive David Elia has publicly defended fund's liquidity position, recently bolstering its cash reserves to $6 billion. The fund's statement said it remained ""committed to supporting the Federal Government's policy to allow members to access up to a total of $20,000 from their superannuation accounts"" and that it had ""ample liquidity available to support members undergoing financial hardship"".   REST, the industry fund representing retail employees and managing about $60 billion in retirement savings, is also expected to see a flood of applications. It has a longstanding clause that states the trustee has discretion to pay out, but a spokesman said the fund had ""extensive liquid assets and is currently well placed to support the early release measures when they become available from April 20"". ""We are also stress testing our liquidity position regularly and are currently comfortable with our financial position to handle a variety of early release scenarios,"" he said. ""The regulations for the new early release measure require us to pay members as soon as practicable after we receive the ATO's determination,"" the REST spokesman added.   Unisuper the $85 billion fund representing university workers, updated its trust deed this week, but said that had nothing to do with the Government scheme. ""The update reflects the changes that were agreed in 2019 and have no impact to payments for members requesting early access to super,"" a spokeswoman told ABC News. ""We have no intention to suspend/restrict payments to eligible members requesting early access to super,"" she added. ""UniSuper has a very conservative approach to liquidity management and we're well positioned to handle the current situation as a result of the pandemic.""   MediaSuper represents those in media and entertainment industry and has more than $6 billion in funds under management. It told ABC News its clause regarding ""absolute discretion"" to impose conditions or restrictions on the amount of money members were able to withdraw was ""a standard provision"" that had been around for years. ""There were no limits or restrictions placed on withdrawals from or investment switches within Media Super during the global financial crisis, and we don't anticipate imposing any limits or restrictions during the current crisis,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Well-run funds are managed with key risks, including substantial market swings or increased switches or withdrawals, considered and factored into investment portfolio strategies and management.""   ""It is the ATO, not the fund, that determines the eligibility of applicants for early release of their super."" ""We will be processing applications as and when approved by the ATO and have more than adequate liquidity to cover the estimated level of applications."" Cbus, the fund representing the construction industry, noted that it had no clause that provided a broad discretionary power to freeze payments, but required members to prove eligibility for withdrawal to protect its members. A spokesman said the fund had ""paid close attention to the lessons of the GFC"". ""We have a very robust approach to liquidity and stress testing,"" the Cbus spokesman said. ""Cbus is in a strong position with liquidity and we believe we are able to pay all member hardship claims, even prior to the recent Jobseeker payment announcement.""   Alex Dunnin, director of financial services research firm Rainmaker, also argued the industry did not have a liquidity problem and said it was ""premature to speculate that some funds will get into trouble"". While it would ""have to wait and see how the rule changes impacts particular funds"", he said the industry had about $950 billion in cash and bonds — $397 billion cash and $549 billion in bonds.   And should it really run into trouble, the Future Fund was ""sitting on the sidelines with $37 billion in cash and bonds"". ""We also need to realise that it's not the capital market falls that are the issue because super funds appear to have withstood that onslaught reasonably, all things considered,"" Mr Dunnin said. ""It's the forced hibernation of particular industries and the Government changing the early release rules which … regulators had no warning of, much less super funds."" ""To say funds should have seen this coming is disingenuous."" The industry had a fantastic year in 2019, so the 12-month return was only down 3 per cent despite the recent bushfires and current coronavirus crisis. ""Funds have had a boom 10 years, so they're weathering the storm,"" he said. All funds would follow the law, he said, ""And if not, you have a regulator with a baseball bat"".   The real test for superfunds was whether funds could handle higher administration requirements as they were faced with a flood of enquiries. And another challenge would be how funds dealt with the change in priorities from long-term investment to short-term cash management. Super had now become a form of emergency cash management, and some funds were concerned there would be pressure from the Federal Government to change the way super funds operated in the future. ""They've now received a strong message that they must be prepared to play a fundamentally different role in the economy,"" Mr Dunnin said. The industry would have to hold more cash and liquid assets, which ""could have profound effects on future returns"". ""Funds are going to have to build reserves for this type of event,"" he said. The big increase in government debt also meant ""we might have to rethink the fundamental tax structure of the superannuation tax system"". ""Once again young people may get hit just as they're getting started,"" he said. ""We simply don't know how this will play out.""

10,/news/2019-12-18/inside-the-islamic-state-hack-that-crippled-the-terror-group/11792958?section=politics,Licence to hack: using a keyboard to fight Islamic State,"Inside the secret hack that infiltrated, and then tore down, Islamic State's propaganda unit.   Her life at work is so secret, not even her family knows what it involves. So when Sarah sat down with the ABC for an exclusive interview she couldn't use her real name. ""My family doesn't know what I do, so I would not let adversaries or terrorists know what I do,"" she said. For the first time, the 30-something hacker has revealed her role in infiltrating — and then tearing down — Islamic State's propaganda unit. It was seen as a critical assignment. Islamic State's ability to recruit online through its sophisticated videos and glossy magazines written in several languages allowed the group's hateful messaging to metastasise across the world. It was turning susceptible citizens into menacing warriors of a demented ideology. In this battle, Sarah's computer skills were as powerful and as consequential as an SAS soldier who eliminates enemies with lethal force on the ground. Her staging post was a windowless room in Canberra at an undisclosed location. She led the Australian team on a top-secret operation alongside American operatives in 2016. Operation Glowing Symphony was established to hack into Islamic State's online system. The mission was to isolate its network, lock out users and then obliterate its contents. By deleting everything, the group's ability to produce propaganda and spread misinformation was ruined. Some details of this operation have now been declassified. They provide a rare insight into how professional hackers played a key role in weakening Islamic State's recruitment and ability to launch attacks. Sarah works for the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), one of the nation's most secretive organisations. It describes itself as operating ""in the slim area between the difficult and impossible"" and is responsible for foreign signals intelligence and cyber warfare. In simple terms, it spies on people or groups offshore who are a threat to Australians and, when required, launches cyber-attacks to disrupt, control or destroy. Ben Staughton is in charge of ASD's hacking division and has never spoken publicly about Australia's ability to hack and attack online. In ""spook"" language, those skills are known as offensive cyber capabilities. The ABC met Staughton at ASD's headquarters. ""It looks more like an office workplace than walking out into a field full of soldiers,"" he explains. ASD officers don't wear uniforms, unless you count jeans and shirts, and their tool of trade is the humble keyboard, a powerful weapon on the modern battlefield. As Australia and its allies fought Islamic State militants from the ground and air, it became clear its online propaganda division was a lethal threat. At its peak, at least 100 people worked for the propaganda unit, including IT specialists, graphic designers and video producers.   ""[It had] direct messaging for people around the world, [which was] 'come here and fight for us',"" Staughton said. Islamic State produced glossy digital magazines in multiple languages, instructing how and where to launch attacks. It beamed videos across the globe to entice recruits, targeting the disaffected, the marginalised and the resentful. Staughton said Islamic State's messaging worked. ""It [the propaganda unit] was quite effective, there was a large number of people from across the world who were going to the Middle East to undertake the fight,"" he said. Islamic State's propaganda division was proving to be as dangerous as its armed fighters and bomb makers. ""A lot of the individuals who worked on the virtual caliphate had the same salaries and titles as military commanders on the ground,"" said Lydia Khalil, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, where she studies Islamic State's online activities closely. ""It gives you an indication of the level of importance that the Islamic State attached to those efforts."" To counter Islamic State's technological sophistication, the United States, Australia and other allies launched what's been described as the largest offensive cyber operation in US military history. ""It was a very big, high-end operation,"" Staughton said. The Australian Signals Directorate established a team of about 20 experts to join Operation Glowing Symphony. They ranged from cultural specialists to linguists, counter-terrorism experts, intelligence analysts, offensive cyber operators (more commonly known as hackers) and IT technical specialists. Aged between 24 and 38, many studied standard degrees at university, including science, maths, languages and marketing, before undergoing intensive training to prepare for cyber warfare. The Australian team spent months planning for the operation. This included online reconnaissance to spy on members of the Islamic State propaganda unit. ""You need to know how they will respond when we conduct operations against them, to inform your tactics of how you will go back against them,"" Sarah said. ASD wanted to learn as much as it could about Islamic State members to gain a competitive edge.   ""We have an extensive team of experts on these targets including counter-terrorism experts, cultural experts and even behavioural analysts who provide input into how these targets operate,"" she said. As the US and its allies continued to spy and poke around Islamic State's online network, they discovered it only had 10 entry points across the whole system. ""If we were to say that ISIL media networks were a house, these were the 10 doors that we found that we could get in, to then do the remainder of the actions to disrupt it,"" Sarah said, using an alternative acronym for Islamic State. ASD won't disclose how it went about opening those doors. But hacking methods can include finding weaknesses in a network, determining a person's username or password, or using phishing emails to gain access. After four months of spying and war gaming, Australia was ready to work with its allies to bring down Islamic State's online propaganda unit. It was November 2016 and the Australian Signals Directorate team assembled in an ultra-secure room lined with a long row of computers, the keyboards glowing red and blue.   ""The Americans sent through the code word to kick off the operation,"" Sarah said. The codeword was a football team, which Sarah wouldn't name. It marked the beginning of a 12-hour day of typing and tactics. As the lead offensive cyber operator, Sarah monitored and directed the ASD team that was split into smaller groups, working to attack multiple targets simultaneously. ""We had an extensive sheet of targets pinned against the wall that all the operators were looking at and tactically going in through that process of access the accounts, lock them out, steal the content and delete it all,"" Sarah said. In simple terms, Australia's cyber experts broke down the door, pilfered everything in the room, and when they left put a huge padlock on the door so Islamic State couldn't get back in. ""Our targets that we were going after were essentially responsible for some of the really glossy publications that were being used for recruitment and photographs from the battlefield,"" Sarah said. ""We [were] going after the networks where they're hosting the material that's coming off the battlefields, where they are doing graphic design of that material coming off the battlefields, where they are storing it or projecting it out globally, to its websites."" The Australian team's initial 12-hour shift was followed up with further cyber assaults on Islamic State's network for another week. The team scooped up three terabytes of data from Islamic State's network, including everything from photos to videos and documents. The terror group's back-ups were also deleted so that it had no option but to rebuild from scratch. After the raid, Ben Staughton said it would have been impossible for Islamic State members to log into the network. ""[It was] like scorched earth,"" he told the ABC. ""You no longer had access to email, to your virtual private networks, to your media production capabilities. ""So your suite of software that you would use to produce the types of things that you are doing, you would never get them back because we had destroyed them all."" Lydia Khalil from the Lowy Institute said while Operation Glowing Symphony interrupted Islamic State's propaganda efforts, the terrorist group did its best to rebuild. ""You did see a difference, but you didn't see a complete eradication of the Islamic State's online presence either,"" she said.   The ABC is aware that further cyber-attacks against Islamic State have been launched since Operation Glowing Symphony, but ASD has refused to comment. Ms Khalil said those ongoing attacks are wearing Islamic State down. ""There would be a takedown, the Islamic State would recover slightly, but each time they were starting lower and lower on the ladder,"" she said. Sarah's team is imaginative and disciplined and their workload is only set to grow as people wanting to cause harm choose the web as their weapon of choice. ""I know the people have the skills, they know their jobs,"" she said. ""We are ready.""

11,/news/2019-12-19/fact-check-year-ender-2019-angus-taylor-golden-zombie/11802536?section=politics,"Climate, economy, drought, bushfires and the election made 2019 a big year in fact checking","It was a year of crippling drought, bushfires and a bitterly fought federal election campaign won by the Coalition against the expectations of pollsters, journalists and bookmakers. Tax, the economy and the environment, along with a host of other issues, kept RMIT ABC Fact Check busy holding public figures to account across a year in which the spread of misleading information was as palpable as ever. The 2019 Fact Check Golden Zombie award — for a ""debunked claim which refuses to die"" — goes to Energy Minister Angus Taylor for repeating his misleading assertion, from April, that the Coalition inherited from Labor a 755 million tonne greenhouse gas ""emissions deficit"" needed to reach Australia's second Kyoto target, and, through the Government's ""hard work"", turned this around by 1.1 billion tonnes.   As Fact Check has pointed out — frequently — the so-called ""emissions deficit"" referred to by the Coalition was taken from an October 2012 report, and merely represented a forecast of the greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to hit Australia's 2020 target at that time. Soon after the Coalition came to office, in a report released in December 2013 which superseded the 2012 report, it became apparent that emissions under Labor's carbon tax had been lower than expected. Government officials also for the first time factored in a significant ""carryover"" from the overachievement of the first Kyoto target, covering the period 2008 to 2012. Since then, emissions have been lower than anticipated as a result of high power prices, the states' adoption of renewable energy and the closure of coal-fired power stations, including Victoria's Hazelwood plant — all of which had little to do with ""hard work"" by the Coalition. The link between fires, drought and climate change, Australia's track record as a large coal producer and exporter, and the extent to which Australia is meeting its international obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions continued to fuel debate during the year.   The controversial Adani coal project was the source of division and angst within Labor ranks. Shortly after Labor's shock election loss, Labor's resources spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, suggested the focus on Adani was ""crazy"", claiming a mine just as big had been approved by the Queensland Government in the Bowen Basin and ""hardly got noticed"". Fact Check found this claim doesn't stack up, largely because the mine referred to by Mr Fitzgibbon — Olive Downs, near Moranbah, south-west of Mackay — was smaller. Fact Check has also examined several claims relating to Australia's track record tackling greenhouse gas emissions. Liberal MP Katie Allen, for example, recently told ABC TV that the Coalition Government had ""done a great job"" reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""They have fallen since 2005,"" she said. ""They are the lowest they have ever been.""   Fact Check found the first part of Ms Allen's claim — that emissions had fallen since 2005 — to be misleading, and the second — that emissions are the lowest they have ever been — to be incorrect. One of the issues that attracted most interest from our readers and viewers was a claim by Prime Minister Scott Morrison responding to Labor's target, announced in the lead-up to the election, to lift electric vehicle sales to 50 per cent of new vehicles by 2030. During the campaign, Mr Morrison said an electric vehicle won't tow a trailer, won't tow a boat, and ""it's not going to get you out to your favourite camping spot with your family"". Fact Check found this claim to be ""in need of a tune up"". Electric vehicle technology is rapidly evolving, but already some models — the Tesla Model X, for example — can reach up to 500 kilometres, with ample towing capacity.   More recently Fact Check looked at the question of Australia's level of ""responsibility"" for global carbon emissions. Mr Morrison has often insisted Australia is responsible for just 1.3 per cent of global emissions, and by extension, can do little to influence the climate. Fact Check's analysis found the figure to be between 3.3 per cent and 4.4 per cent, after accounting for exports but also, for consistency, netting out imports of fossil fuels. At the end of the year, the catastrophic bushfires in NSW set social media abuzz with claims funding for the state's firefighters has been slashed. Among those claiming a funding cut was NSW Opposition Leader Jodi McKay, who said Fire and Rescue NSW and the Rural Fire Service combined are facing a $40 million budget cut in 2019-20. We found this ""doesn't stack up"", largely because unlike the previous year, the 2019-20 estimates do not include top-ups for natural disaster spending, which the fire agencies are almost certain to receive.  According to former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce the one thing Australia can do to reduce the effects of drought is build the Bradfield Scheme, an ambitious plan from the 1930s that would divert northern flood waters inland. Fact Check found this to be ""pie in the sky"". The viability of the Bradfield Scheme has been dismissed many times by experts over the past 80 years on scientific, engineering and economic grounds. When Mr Taylor and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese clashed over whether Labor or the Liberal Party delivered the Snowy Scheme, Fact Check found the notion that any one side built the project to be exaggerated.   In reality, no one government can claim credit for the scheme, which took decades to plan and complete. According to the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services Inspector Andrew Sturgess, fire danger ratings in south-east Queensland had never been seen at such a high level so early in the year in recorded history. After scrutinising daily records from the Bureau of Meteorology about bushfire danger stretching back to January 1950 for four south-east Queensland fire districts, Fact Check found this claim to be close to the mark. And as usual the economy and taxation were key issues. In the lead-up to the election, Fact Check scrutinised various claims from the Coalition that Labor's plans to restrict negative gearing for new housing investors; cut capital gains tax breaks; and end franking credit cash refunds for shareholders who pay no tax; would mainly hit lower income earners. In all cases Fact Check found these claims to be misleading. Sluggish wages growth has also fuelled debate. In May, then opposition leader Bill Shorten said the price of everything was going up except wages.   Fact Check found the claim did not stack up. Wages may have been growing at a slow pace, but pay packets have still generally been expanding at a rate outstripping inflation. That means real wages have risen. Likewise, Fact Check found Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had made a fair call when he said the minimum wage had grown at a rate outstripping both inflation and average wages since the Coalition came to power, and that the real minimum wage had gone backwards under Labor. The Coalition has for months insisted the outlook is ""optimistic"" and that the fundamentals for the economy remain strong. Labor, on the other hand, has argued the economy is floundering. In August Fact Check found Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers had made a fair call when he said the economy was growing at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. During the year there was also discussion about Australia's treatment of asylum seekers, with the Parliament debating a new law to allow refugees on Manus Island and Nauru to be brought to Australia temporarily for medical treatment. Immigration Minister David Coleman, for example, claimed the controversial ""medevac"" bill required a ""very, very low threshold"" for bringing refugees and asylum seekers to Australia, with no requirement for people to be sick.   Fact Check found this was spin: under the now-defunct law two treating doctors would need to be of the opinion the transfer was necessary because treatment or further assessment could not be performed in the regional processing country. The transfer could then be refused by the Immigration Minister if they ""reasonably believed"" it to be unnecessary. That decision, in turn, could only be overruled if, after a further clinical assessment, the majority of an eight-member independent medical panel viewed the transfer as necessary. Likewise, Fact Check scrutinised a claim by Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton that prominent Greens figures Richard Di Natale and Bob Brown, both of whom worked as medical doctors in the past, could be among those qualified to provide the medical advice used to justify a transfer of asylum seekers under the medevac legislation.   Fact Check found this claim was a ""long bow"", given neither Mr Brown nor Senator Di Natale are currently registered medical practitioners. Mr Morrison, Mr Dutton and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann also claimed Australians faced being ""displaced"" from hospital waiting lists by an influx of asylum seekers and refugees seeking medical treatment under the legislation. Fact Check found this claim was baseless, with experts pointing out even if all refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island were sent to Australia for treatment, they could be accommodated by the health system without any material impact on hospital waiting lists. The federal election was not the only time voters went to the polls. In March the NSW public voted to re-elect the Coalition Government, now led by Premier Gladys Berejiklian, for a third four-year term. Fact Check found a claim by NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet comparing the current NSW unemployment rate to the rate under Labor a decade earlier during the middle of the global financial crisis was ""cherrypicking"". A claim by NSW Greens MLC David Shoebridge that homelessness in NSW had jumped by more than 30 per cent in five years was found to be close to the mark. Another, made by then opposition leader Michael Daley that the Government had closed 15 more schools than they'd opened since 2011 was found be spin. Fact Check also found a claim by Ms Berejiklian that NSW had the largest use of solar energy doesn't check out. But it wasn't all politics, tax and climate change. One of the issues that prompted the biggest response from our audience stemmed from old fashioned interstate rivalry. Resources Minister Matt Canavan, who is from Queensland, declared Melbourne's most divisive traffic rule — the hook turn — was a ""stupid"" way to manage traffic, claiming no other city ""has adopted this confusing practice"". As Fact Check found, a number of other cities use the hook turn, although not to the same extent as Melbourne. And, according to the experts, hook turns are not such a stupid way to manage traffic after all, reducing congestion and improving safety. Fact Check also took a dive into AFL history to test whether an August 9 match between Hawthorn and the Greater Western Sydney Giants at Canberra's Manuka Oval was the only time it had snowed at an AFL game. Nor did Fact Check shirk big theological questions, tackling a claim that the rules of Catholic confession are not in the Bible and can consequently be changed to support priests to report confessions of child sexual abuse to police. Which side of politics fared best in terms of the claims selected by Fact Check in 2019? Slightly under half, 48 per cent, of Labor Party claims (state and federal) scrutinised by Fact Check had broadly positive verdicts, while 38 per cent were broadly negative and 14 per cent were neutral. When it came to Coalition claims, 40 per cent of verdicts were broadly positive, 47 per cent broadly negative and 13 per cent neutral. factcheck@rmit.edu.au ",RMIT ABC Fact Check economics and finance editor Josh Gordon,"December 19, 2019"
12,/news/2019-12-12/ato-corporate-tax-transparency-data-companies-no-tax-paid/11789048?section=politics,ATO data reveals one third of large companies pay no tax,"About one third of large companies have once again failed to pay a cent of tax, according to the Tax Office's latest corporate tax transparency report released on Thursday.   Of 2,214 entities covered by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) data for 2017-18, 710 did not pay any tax. Many companies have claimed tax losses and concessions that often go back several years. There were 1,504 corporate entities in the 2017–18 data that reported tax payable of $52.3 billion — a net increase of $6.6 billion from the previous year. The ATO's report noted the increase was primarily driven by the mining, energy and water segment, off the back of strong commodity prices, which were up 15 per cent in Australian dollar terms in 2017–18. ATO deputy commissioner Rebecca Saint said groups that consistently reported losses or unusually low taxable incomes were more likely to attract the ATO's attention. She told ABC News there were still instances of outright tax avoidance, in which multinationals attempted to shift profits outside of Australia to reduce their local taxable income, and these often resulted in the ATO's Tax Avoidance Taskforce specialist teams undertaking audits. ""The positive trend we are now observing is that many companies have ceased generating accounting losses, and are now offsetting profits by utilising losses from prior years,"" Ms Saint said. ""We expect many companies to exhaust these losses and begin paying income tax in the coming years,"" she added. Ms Saint said laws passed by the Federal Government were helping the ATO take ""strong action"". She said more than $7 billion of sales income was now being booked in Australia as a result of companies, including Facebook and Google, restructuring in response to the Federal Government's tougher anti-avoidance laws, including the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL).   The Diverted Profits Tax (DPT) is also helping the agency get the information it needs if companies are deliberately obfuscating. And previous stronger transfer pricing laws passed under the former Labor government have given the ATO an arsenal to fight companies it believes may be overstepping the line. Of the 2,214 corporate entities covered in the data, 1,197 are foreign-owned companies with an income of $100 million or more. Of the 1,017 Australian public or private entities, 594 have an income of $100 million or more, and 423 have an income of $200 million or more. Corporate entities with an income of more than $5 billion represent only 2 per cent of the corporate transparency population but are liable for 53 per cent ($27.9 billion) of the tax payable for the population. This share of tax payable decreased slightly from 57 per cent in the previous year, the ATO report said. The proportion of entities with nil tax payable has fallen over the past three years, from 36 per cent in 2015-16 to 34 per cent in 2016-17 and 32 per cent in 2017-18. ""We look at the tax positions of these [large] companies very, very closely,"" Ms Saint said. ""And we have observed that companies can and do make losses as part of usual business practices."" The reasons why 710 companies did not pay any tax in 2017-18 included: As the ATO foreshadowed last year, the Petroleum Resources Rent Tax (PRRT) payable exceeded $1 billion. There were nine corporate entities with PRRT payable of $1.16 billion.   The number of entities paying PRRT decreased from 14 in the previous year and PRRT payable increased from $946 million. ""The increase in PRRT payable reflects the increased profitability of PRRT-liable companies in 2017– 18, of which oil prices (up 21 per cent) were a key driver,"" the ATO's report said. The ATO also provides a theoretical estimate of how much tax is owed by large corporates with a turnover of more than $250 million. In 2016–17, large corporate groups reported approximately $47 billion in corporate income tax. The net tax gap was estimated at $2 billion, or 4 per cent.  While more than 170 large corporate groups have signed up to the Board of Taxation's Voluntary Tax Transparency Code, many companies still do not give detailed information about their tax affairs. Second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn has previously made public comments noting that the corporate tax transparency data offers limited information which is hard to reconcile with accounting information in company financial reports.   The financial reports often give limited insight into a company's Australian operations, and Mr Hirschhorn has called on companies to be far more transparent, including by providing more details about money flowing offshore to related entities in financial and/or other reports. The ATO notes several limitations in its data. First, the 2,214 corporate tax entities are not necessarily standalone entities and are sometimes part of a group of entities. ""The majority of economic groups in the corporate transparency population have linked entities outside the scope of this measure,"" the report said. About 72 per cent of Australian private entities in the transparency population are linked to groups controlled by wealthy individuals, including high-wealth individuals. The groups consist of close to 11,000 linked entities, including companies, trusts, partnerships and superannuation funds. The ATO report said confidentiality provisions prevented the agency disclosing certain information about them. ""This means we cannot include details of the income and tax paid by other related entities,"" the report said. GetUp Campaigns Director Ed Miller said the tax system needed to be overhauled. ""People are sick of waking up each December to find out they've personally contributed more tax than massive corporations,"" he said. ""Wages have flatlined, everyday people are feeling the brunt of a stagnating economy and still paying more tax than some of the world's biggest corporations. It's just not fair."" The ATO often hits companies with tax bills, but later decides to settle rather than fight for the money in court.   For example, the ATO said in 2017-18 it hit ""large corporate groups"" with $3.7 billion in tax assessments but ended up collecting $2.86 billion in cash (including interest and penalties) after audits. Ms Saint said the ATO was very careful about which cases it litigated, and any settlements with large corporations were checked by retired Federal Court judges to ensure they were appropriate. ""It is not possible to litigate each and every case, nor is it an effective use of resources,"" Ms Saint said. She also noted settlements often resulted in companies agreeing to lock in future taxes. For example, when BHP made a settlement with the ATO last year, it agreed that from July 2019 all profits made from its Singaporean marketing hub in relation to Australian commodities would be fully subject to Australian tax. ""We are looking for taxpayers to make changes in their compliance behaviour going forward,"" Ms Saint said.

13,/news/2019-12-05/witness-j-revealed-secret-trial/11764676?section=politics,'The quiet person you pass on the street': Secret prisoner Witness J revealed,"Just 13 words are all there are on the public record to note one of the most extraordinary episodes in Australian legal history.   After a secret trial of a secret prisoner, the sentence was delivered — you guessed it — in complete secrecy. You have to know what you're looking for, but even when you find those 13 words, they are not at all illuminating. In fact, they would defeat the purpose of being there at all, were it not for the legal tease they present. ""Before Justice Burns, in Court Room SC4, at 10:00am,"" it starts promisingly enough. Then comes the inevitable punchline: ""Sentence: Matter Suppressed."" The date was February 19 of this year. The venue was the ACT Supreme Court in Canberra. Exactly why the Commonwealth and the justice system should conspire to allow such exceptional measures has unnerved legal experts and dismayed former judges. ""Permanently secret legal proceedings is not the kind of conduct we want an Australian justice system to include,"" said barrister Bret Walker, a former independent national security legislation monitor. An investigation by the ABC has uncovered the remarkable events that led to the secret trial, the unravelling of a man's impressive career and the circumstances of his arrest, which led to a jail sentence of two years and seven months for serious national security offences.   By February 19, the defendant had already been locked up for nine months as Prisoner 123458. He had been remanded in custody by ACT Chief Magistrate Lorraine Walker in mid-May 2018.  After a month in solitary confinement, he was placed in the high-security sex offenders' wing of Canberra's Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC).   He was not a sex offender. Not at all. Housing him with convicted paedophiles and rapists was deemed a better option than putting him alongside murderers, gangsters and other hardened criminals in the other wing. The legal proceedings before his sentencing had not gone entirely unnoticed. That was impossible with two burly security guards sitting outside the courtroom, barring the curious from entry. Two professionally curious court reporters, the ABC's Michael Inman and The Canberra Times' Alexandra Back, jointly wondered what was happening inside SC4. It was decided Back should make an inquiry with the Chief Justice, Helen Murrell. The response, which came from Justice John Burns, seemed regretful, practically apologetic, for what he described as the ""generally undesirable"" and ""unusual"" security arrangements. Justice Burns said that on November 19, 2018, he had agreed, at the request of the parties to the proceeding, to make ""consent orders"" under the National Security (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004, closing the court to the public ""during the taking of evidence and submissions"". ""The particularly sensitive nature of the material to be exposed in the proceeding, and the grave harm that could occur if the material became public, outweighed the desirability of ensuring that proceedings before the Court are open to the public,"" Justice Burns said in a note to the reporters. ""The decision to close the Court was not taken lightly,"" he told them, adding that he regretted not being able to say any more. The nation's chief law officer insists secrecy was needed to protect national security. ""The court determined, consistent with the Government submission, that it was contrary to the public interest that the information be disclosed and the information was of a kind that could endanger the lives or safety of others,"" Attorney-General Christian Porter told the ABC. What happened to Witness J, as he has become known, might not have become known were it not for the fact that the day before he was sentenced by Justice Burns, his cell was raided by Australian Federal Police officers under court warrant, looking for a memoir Witness J had written during his time locked up alongside sex offenders. What can be gleaned publicly about Witness J came almost by accident, when he took action in the ACT courts to complain about his treatment and what he claimed was a breach of his human rights.  The action failed, at his own considerable cost, but it did at least drag Witness J's fate from the darkest shadows into the half-light.   Witness J was convicted under the myriad security laws that can trigger wide-ranging suppression of any outside scrutiny or media reporting. Since his civil action against the ACT Government became public last month, a person purporting to be Witness J has been testing the bounds of the suppression orders, taking to Twitter to claim he is the victim of an unfair prosecution. ""Persecuted. Jailed after asking for mental health support three times, and falling through the floor,"" he has tweeted. A former military intelligence officer, Witness J is a Duntroon graduate in his mid 30s who served in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq. He has a distinguished record. Witness J worked in various parts of the sprawling military and intelligence network. But Witness J's downfall began during a civilian posting in a South-East Asian country when he was undergoing a re-validation of his Top Secret security clearance, which by practice is about every five years. He would have been one of 25 or so people in his service undergoing a re-validation process that month and the questions from the vetting officer would have been standard, including about his financial and personal circumstances. But there were some anomalies in his answers that prompted more and more inquiry. Truthfulness is key in these interviews.   It is understood his lack of candour prompted concerns being raised with Witness J about how he was conducting himself as a single man in the South-East Asian capital. There was a worry he could be compromised. This coincided with a mental health crisis, which is not uncommon with people who have given many years' service in hostile environments. Witness J sought internal help on three occasions for his mental health but his security clearance prevented seeking help outside his employment. The ABC has been told Witness J was infuriated by the accusation that his behaviour while overseas had made him a compromise risk. He complained internally to the head of security and a departmental psychologist back in Australia. It was an unwise decision delivered dangerously. It is understood his complaints were communicated by email and other unsecure electronic means. Witness J immediately found himself in the crosshairs of an organisation that had been his employer for five years. In his complaints, he accused fellow case officers of behaviour which he believed was more egregious than his own. Worse, he identified agents who had been recruited for direction and control. These were grave, unforgivable sins in his line of work. His employer said Witness J had breached secrecy provisions. It believed he was acting so dangerously, he was imperilling lives, national security and the very working environment of his colleagues. According to one person, Witness J had to be ""shut down"". On Twitter, ""Witness J"" claims his case was unprecedented. From what the ABC has uncovered, he is probably right. ""How do I know? The open-mouthed gapes from my defence team and the DPP as they waded through unwalked ground,"" he has tweeted. However, he did not contest the five charges and he pleaded guilty, as advised by his barrister Kieran Ginges, even though Witness J had argued there had been no public disclosure and no release of information outside his employer. That is not how the prosecution or his employer saw it. ""The orders provided for a mechanism for closure of the court in circumstances where highly sensitive national security information would have been disclosed, but did not prevent the defendant or his counsel from accessing the information,"" Mr Porter said. Witness J's complaints had put critically sensitive information within the potential grasp of rival espionage capability, if the unsecure communications were electronically ""triangulated"". Witness J was released from jail on August 16, some 16 months or so before the expiry of his sentence. It is understood there are conditions attached to his release, including six-monthly regular psychological testing and an overseas travel ban without prior permission. By negotiation, he is able to describe his convictions as having been for ""mishandled classified information"". Other descriptors of his crimes, perhaps less damning, had been offered to him, in the hope it would help him find employment.   Since his release, Witness J has complained about his treatment to the inspector-general of Intelligence and Security. She, however, has no power to overturn his convictions. Witness J appears to claim being the victim of an injustice; that what should have been treated as an internal complaint left him with a criminal conviction and serious mental health issues. Witness J admitted to serious breaches of security protocols, but observers say his secret dispatch by Australia's legal regime raises considerable concern for a robust democracy. John Dowd, a former NSW Liberal leader, attorney-general and Supreme Court judge, said there needed to be an explanation for the secret trial. ""Society has to be very careful in the circumstance in which we hold limited-publicity trials and it's important that we know the extent of such trials and the reasons for them,"" Mr Dowd said. ""There are obvious circumstances where trials have to be limited in terms of publicity but these should be extremely rare. ""There needs to be some explanation to the public as to why this has occurred — and if it's not a matter explained to the public, then the matter should be explained to the Parliament.""   Mr Walker's criticism is similar: ""The public has an interest to know when information is being kept secret from them — it's not good enough for the public to be told 'it's in your interests that you are not told'."" ""What the [Witness J] case has produced is a concrete example of the dangers of not publishing, in real time as they occur, the fact of the orders being made; it's a really interesting example of the way in which a perfectly well-intentioned piece of national security legislation might not be operating in the way one would like."" Federal independent MP Andrew Wilkie, a former military analyst, is circumspect about the Witness J case, perhaps surprisingly so given he has been outspoken in his criticism of the pursuit of Witness K and his lawyer Bernard Collaery. ""I have made my own inquiries and decided not to comment,"" is all Mr Wilkie will say of the Witness J case.   But this opaque episode provokes big questions for Australia's legal regime. Even if there are serious matters of national security at issue, should questions of wrongdoing be held entirely in secret and covered by blanket suppression orders? And how is it that a man who has given considerably to his nation over a decade and a half — and has the physical and mental scars to show for it — should have his contribution effectively scrubbed out in 13 words? ""I am you. I am an Australian,"" the man purporting to be Witness J said on Twitter. ""The quiet person you pass in the street. Tonight, I want to do my best to answer your questions, but as a secret prisoner from a secret trial who worked for a secret organisation, I am limited."" But as one informed person observed: ""Some secrets must remain secret.""",Exclusive by political editor Andrew Probyn,"December 05, 2019"
14,/news/2019-12-06/mick-keelty-slams-agriculture-department-over-water/11767052?section=politics,Murray-Darling Basin's top cop offers a damning assessment of the federal Agriculture Department ,"The Murray-Darling Basin's top cop has tipped a bucket on the federal Agriculture Department, saying it suffers from inaction and a risk-averse culture and has no clear mission when it comes to water.   In a long-awaited report, the Northern Basin Commissioner (NBC) calls for more compliance attention to environmental outcomes, improved transparency of water management decisions, better engagement with Aboriginal nations and to simplify policy settings. Mick Keelty, a former federal police commissioner, was appointed after Four Corners revealed water was stolen in the upper Darling River. The office was recently expanded to cover the whole Basin, when Mr Keelty was appointed the interim inspector general for the Murray-Darling Basin. The NBC report, tabled on the final parliamentary sitting day of the year, said the Department of Agriculture (DA) ""does not enjoy a good reputation"". ""The department suffers a reputation of having too many bureaucratic barriers preventing programs from being funded and completed in a timely fashion,"" it said. ""Within the DA there is a strong sense of control over taxpayer funds, which is understandable, but the level of control ultimately risks timely delivery of projects .... taxpayer's money has to be managed diligently and with integrity, however delivery and implementation should not be impeded through overly bureaucratic processes.""   The report said stakeholders were concerned that the department had developed a risk-averse culture. ""It was observed the department is populated by people with expertise and passion, which belies its reputation for being slow to operate and overly bureaucratic,"" it states. The report said it was not clear what the role of the water division at the department was. ""For example is it the department's role in water to protect the public purse or is it to manage the water resources of the MDB (Murray-Darling Basin)? Is its role to protect water resources for the First Nations, environment and legally entitled water licence holder of the MDB or is it the department's role to deliver outcomes of the Ministerial Council on the MDB that was established by COAG?"" it questioned. The report said it was beyond the remit of the NBC to make such a recommendation, but it observed: ""if its key role is in the delivery of infrastructure, then it may be time to consider moving the role from the DA to a department more aligned with delivery of major infrastructure project."" The report was tabled as the ABC revealed more than 100 of the department's water staff had prepared to relocate to the Infrastructure Department, but the move was cancelled at the last minute. On Thursday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a new department Agriculture, Water and Environment Department would be established. It will be led by Andrew Metcalfe, a former boss of the Department of Agriculture who the Coalition sacked when it came to power in 2013.   Mr Keelty's report found political parties had been influenced by lobby groups and donations to political parties. ""There has been a crisis of confidence in the northern basin governance arrangements,"" the report states. ""The situation exacerbated allegations surrounding historical decisions to issues water entitlements, coupled with donations to political parties and or the influence exerted by lobby groups. ""A mature and well organised number of water related lobby groups drive opinions about the virtues, or otherwise of what governments are doing or need to do. ""They are described as having a lot of power but their influence is not immediately transparent, nor easily traced. ""Conflicts of interest do not appear to be well understood, nor declared in many instances, especially as the local government level ... delayed in the publication of political donations feed mistrust regarding compliance with water laws.""   The report referred to a ""culture of waiting out incumbent ministers"" and said there had been 11 federal, six New South Wales and five Queensland ministers and assistant ministers for water since 2007. ""During the reporting period there was a common observation made by public servants, water title holders and lobbyists; their complain was that each time a minister moves into the portfolio of water policy seems to have a different focus,"" the report said. ""This was particularly cited in Queensland in the changeover to the Newman Government from the Bligh Government and more recently in NSW with the change from former Minister [Niall] Blair to Minister [Melinda] Pavey."" It was also highly critical of the tone of criticism in the Basin, making reference to former NSW Water Minister Niall Blair's need for police protection when travelling through the regions. ""The former Minister stood aside from the portfolio after the state election,"" it reads.   ""This was despite the Minister's obvious success in introducing compulsory metering and telemetry legislation, transforming the NSW DPI and winning the respect of peers across the pubic sector and political divide. ""It's useful to reflect upon why we lose quality people who act with integrity and commitment over an issue such as MDB policy."" The report said the traditional owners of the northern basin were not appropriately represented and ""native title in water remains and unresolved issue that needs addressing.""   The report offered praise for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), the agency tasked with overseeing and implementing the Basin Plan. ""The MDBA is singled out as being the most engaging and professional of all the agencies in this first year of the NBC,"" the report found. ""Their leadership, culture and ability to deliver succinct briefings on complex issues is well above the standards of the other agencies."" The report also praised the NSW National Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) as a ""stand out agency that immediately embraced the NBC role"". Federal Water Minister David Littleproud said the report gave a fresh perspective on northern basin issues. ""We shouldn't be afraid of new ideas, the old ways may not serve us well into the future,"" Mr Littleproud said. ""The report has strong messages for federal and state water managers across the Basin on how we can better serve the people who live there."" Mr Littleproud is calling on the states to grant Mr Keelty powers to investigate across jurisdictions.",ABC Rural      By national rural reporters Kath Sullivan and Clint Jasper,"December 06, 2019"
15,/news/2020-04-10/the-rules-of-driving-during-coronavirus/12132208?section=politics,Can I drive under coronavirus restrictions? How many passengers? Answering your Easter weekend driving questions,"As the Easter weekend approaches, there is a great temptation to hit the road, but authorities have warned drivers to think carefully before grabbing their keys. Conscious of keeping coronavirus under control, police across the country have redoubled their efforts to crack down on non-essential travel. So what is essential? Can you drive to see a partner or a relative? What about a quick trip to a holiday home or for a leisurely cruise around town? Each state and territory has different rules so here is a breakdown of what you can and cannot do behind the wheel this long weekend.   Broadly, drivers must have a reasonable excuse to leave their homes. These can include: shopping for food or supplies, travelling for work, to obtain health care or to exercise. In New South Wales, the listed reasons do not specify driving to see a partner, but earlier this week NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said visits would be allowed for ""caring reasons"". ""We have to look after each other, but don't take the whole family with you. Don't take your grandparents,"" he said. In Victoria, similar restrictions apply but partners are an exception. If you live apart, you can visit each other at home.   South Australians have been implored to adhere to the ""spirit of directions"" about travel and restrictions on social gatherings are less strict. Visits where care or support are being provided have been allowed.   Police in Tasmania have warned there will be ""choppers in the sky"" to ensure residents are not leaving their primary residence unless accessing essential services like food or medical supplies. In Western Australia, partners are able to visit each other if they live within the same region.  But those living in separate households must continue to practice social distancing in each other's presence. Yes, really.   Queenslanders and ACT residents can have up to two visitors in their household at a time but they must also practise social distancing. Those in the NT have been told not to gather in groups of more than two people, except with immediate family, if they need to travel outside the home.   For the most part, yes. But there are conditions. In the ACT, NT and Queensland, a person can travel with those living in the same household, or with one other person.   There are explicit exemptions in Queensland for the elderly or people with a disability who require extra assistance.  According to the NSW Government, bans on the gathering of more than two people do not apply in cars or at public transport stops. Victorians have been ""strongly discouraged"" from carrying passengers except those who live in the same household.  The advice is less clear in South Australia, where there must be one person per four square metres. Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens told the ABC earlier this week: ""Anybody who goes against the very strong advice not to travel, still must comply with social distancing requirements,"" he said.   The rules in Tasmania and Western Australia are similarly vague but their governments have warned all passengers need an essential reason to travel. In WA, colleagues can travel to work together as long as they are healthy and take ""usual hygiene precautions"".   The message across the board is pretty much, no. Police across all states and territories will be focusing substantial resources on catching holidaymakers. Even NSW Government MPs have not been spared. In Victoria, though, you are allowed to travel between properties that you own.   Drivers who cannot provide a valid reason for being on the road will be turned back by police. They could also be sent on their way with a hefty fine. Western Australia appears to have the most expensive penalty with people facing up to $50,000 for flouting its travel restrictions. SA, WA, NT and ACT residents who breach self-isolating and social distancing laws can expect around a $1,000 fine.   In Queensland, the maximum penalty is $13,300, while Tasmanians could have to fork out $16,800, or face six months in prison. Police in Victoria can issue fines up to $1,652 who fail to comply with public health directions around gatherings. NSW drivers could spend six months in prison, or be forced to pay $11,000 plus $5,500 per day if they continue to break the rules.

16,/news/2020-04-09/coronavirus-covid-19-most-common-questions-and-answers/12111108?section=politics,"You asked us 45,000 questions about coronavirus COVID-19. Here's what you wanted to know","The spread of coronavirus has changed the way we live, as economic, financial and social impacts reverberate across the globe. Many countries have now closed their borders, businesses have shut their doors and hundreds of thousands of Australians have lost their jobs. To help you navigate through this rapidly changing world we asked what you wanted to know about COVID-19. Over the past month we received 45,000 questions which gave an insight into Australia's biggest worries related to the outbreak. Every day, your questions have helped guide our approach to covering the pandemic. Here's what we've learned about you, and the way you're responding to the coronavirus crisis, along with some of the answers we found for you. (And yes, we really did read every single question you sent us.)   Questions flooded in from across the country, and one thing was abundantly clear: Many of you wanted to know what symptoms to look out for, and the next steps to take if you have any of them.    What are the symptoms of coronavirus and are they distinguishable from the usual flu symptoms? – David, WA My partner woke up with a sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, no body aches and a temperature of 36.9 c, what should we do? – Lisa, Vic You wondered why COVID-19 was such a big deal, and you wanted to be sure you knew how to tell the difference between coronavirus and a cold or flu – especially when it comes to those who are most at risk. Why is this outbreak more serious than, say, the common flu that kills hundreds in Australia each year? – Peter, Vic Is everyone susceptible? – Ian, NT You were also quick to ask about the impact on children, babies and pregnant women. I have heard a lot about the virus affecting elderly people and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions, what about pregnant mothers and small children? – Marita, Vic Should we wait to try and make a baby? Is now a bad time to try and make a baby? – Tim, WA Some, like Tim, were thinking about the impact on family planning. While the risks for mothers and babies have been found to be very low, there are no guarantees, so strict prevention measures must still be in place.      We have been told to wash our hands for no less than 20 seconds. What is the best way to dry them? – Janis, Vic Is liquid soap or bar soap more effective in sanitising hands? – Jo We are advised to stop touching our faces. When I am aware of it, I am touching my face because it itches. Why do our faces itch so much? And why do we touch our faces so much? – Magpie, Vic The strong message is to maintain great personal hygiene by washing your hands frequently. Avoid touching your face, sneeze into your elbow, practice social distancing and stay home if you're sick. If you're debating whether to use bar soap or liquid soap like Jo, the answer boils down to technique.  This demonstration by Dr Karl also shows how to wash your hands effectively and how to best dry them. And just for the record Magpie, we don't blame you.  The fact is if it wasn't for coronavirus we'd all be touching our faces approximately 23 times per hour.   Many of you also wanted to know what self-isolation involves and how it applies to travellers. What are the details to self-isolate in Australia? – Joe, SA If any person arrives in Australia from another country, if they live in a different state than where they land, are they free to take another plane home before self-isolating? – Lynette, NT Early in March, the initial advice on self-isolation only applied to those who had returned from high-risk countries, been in contact with someone who had returned from high-risk countries, or been in contact with a confirmed case. But that changed on March 15, when all incoming travellers were told to put on a mask and head straight home upon touchdown then self-isolate for 14 days. On March 28, Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared all international travellers must complete their 14-day isolation period at a state-run quarantine centre in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus, as returning travellers made up more than two-thirds of Australia's cases. So the answer to your question Lynette is that they would need to complete the mandatory isolation before being able to catch a connecting flight back to their home state.   Territorians seemed the most interested in travel as an issue, with questions on the topic accounting for around one-third of their total queries. I have to go home to Darwin driving via Gold Coast ... do I have to isolate in Queensland even if I'm not staying there or can I just pick up car and start driving to Darwin? – James, NT Should we go ahead with our road trip from Darwin to Perth in our caravan? - Wendy, NT If you land in Perth, your home is Darwin, can you fly on a commercial flight to get to your home to self-isolate? If not, how and where do you self-isolate, is accommodation available for these people? - Di Oleary, NT The NT Government made it clear that as long as you cross their borders, self-isolation is mandatory and accommodation won't be free if you're flying in.  You also asked how the NT's strict border rules compared to other parts of the country. A 14-day quarantine is mandatory in Tasmania and South Australia for all non-essential travellers. Western Australia closed its borders at 11.59pm on Sunday. And you can still get into Queensland if you hold a valid border permit. But your travel questions didn't just apply to international or interstate ventures. Many of you asked about the risk of catching the bus or train and whether services would continue to run across the country. While public transport staff are ramping up the cleaning to keep you safe, you also need to do your part by maintaining personal hygiene and social distancing.    How long does the coronavirus survive? Does it survive longer on different surfaces? – Julie, SA If coronavirus can be found on a variety of surfaces, can it be found on dog fur? And if you pat a dog whose owner has coronavirus, can you potentially pick it up? – Katie, NSW I feel like supermarkets would be a virus hotbed, so when I bring my groceries home what should I do? – Robyn, NSW The lifespan of the coronavirus on surfaces was top of your mind, and it even got Katie thinking about whether pets' fur could contribute to the spread. A lot of research is still being done, but veterinarian Jenni Trewren reckons you are safe to keep your furry friends close.   Transmission through food was another concern, so we came up with a guide to help you survive the ordeal of grocery shopping.  Tip: Always be sure to wash your fruit and vegetables before eating them. Can we have a graph of cases over time please? – Bronwyn, Qld Our Digital Story Innovations team built this interactive article to keep you up to date with cases across the country, so, Bronwyn, you can delve into all the numbers and watch as they change over time.   As job losses mounted up quickly after the closure of non-essential businesses, many of you asked about the support measures the Government was putting in place. Some hospitality businesses are still operating, although limited to takeaway services, so you can still support them. The shift in work habits following the advice to work from home where possible sparked a lot of questions. What are the tax options for PAYE employees covering work from home expenses — utilities, council rates, office supplies, phone, internet etc? – Fiona, VIC What is the Government doing for people who have lost their jobs and have rental agreements? – Heather, TAS When it comes to tax, it's good to stay on the safe side and keep a record of your expenses. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has also announced a new tax method that allows you to claim 80 cents per hour on all running expenses.   Those who lost their jobs or saw their hours cut were more interested in knowing what alternatives were in store for them. The Government initially rolled out a stimulus package to provide financial assistance to five major groups, but later extended that help to affected businesses and workers through JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments. If businesses need to lay off staff, can those who have lost their jobs access Centrelink payments instantly to help with rent/food etc.? If so, what is the process? Also, what if you have a mortgage? Are the banks suspending mortgage payments for those who have lost their jobs? – Jo, Vic For those worried about accessing Centrelink for the first time, we took you through the process step-by-step.  And yes, Jo, the big four banks are offering to freeze mortgage payments. As for rent, a moratorium is not entirely off the table for residential tenants while commercial tenants may now have the option to defer payments. Is it safe to walk my dog in the park if I do not go near anybody? – Malcolm, NSW Is it OK to play golf? – Mary-Anne, ACT Can my daughter see her boyfriend? – Donna, WA Am I allowed to take a 20-minute drive to the beach and have a surf? – John, SA You wanted help understanding the new two-person rule imposed on gatherings and how it might affect you, especially when penalties were set. The law stipulates that there are only four acceptable reasons to leave home. However, it does differ slightly between states, including the activities you can and cannot do.

17,/news/2020-04-08/jobkeeper-bill-passed-questions-answered/12132940?section=politics,"Now that the JobKeeper Payment has passed Parliament, this is how it'll work","The Government's $130 billion JobKeeper scheme — the largest financial lifeline package in Australia's history — has just been passed with the support of both sides of Parliament. It's expected to be accessed by about 6 million workers. Before we get to some lingering questions about how the scheme is going to work, here's a quick recap of what it's offering: There are a few specific criteria you need to meet, including that you're currently employed or were employed by your work at March 1, 2020. This includes anyone that has been stood down or re-hired since then. You also need to be either a full-time or part-time employee or a casual worker who has been employed regularly with the same employer for more than a year. And finally, you need to be either an Australian citizen, someone with a permanent visa, a Protected Special Category Visa holder, a non-protected Special Category Visa holder who has been residing continually in Australia for 10 years or more, or a Special Category (Subclass 444) Visa holder. It's also worth remembering you can only get the JobKeeper Payment from one employer.   Yes it is.    The Government says the payment is essentially the same as any other kind of income you'd normally pay tax on. It'll be paid to you by your employer not the Government, and so the same tax rules apply. Another thing to note is that you won't be paid superannuation for the payment. But you will be paid superannuation for any other income from your employer that might be supplemented by JobKeeper. On the other hand, if you are receiving the JobSeeker payment (previously known as Newstart) directly from the Government, you won't be taxed. That depends on who you're working for. The Government is urging all businesses who've signed up for the JobKeeper Payment to pay their staff the $1,500 a fortnight now, and claim the money back from the Australian Tax Office in May. But if your employer isn't in a financial position to do that at the moment you might have to wait until the beginning of May when the payments start flowing to businesses.    Not if there's no work for you to do. For some businesses, the restrictions introduced by the Federal Government mean they either can't offer the goods or services they usually would, or only in a limited way, like cafes doing takeaway services. In these cases, employees may not have to work at all or may work reduced or modified hours, but will still receive the JobKeeper Payment. Some businesses are also thinking outside the box when it comes to what they can get their employees to do while their usual job is on hold.   If you're receiving the JobSeeker payment you can't also receive JobKeeper. But the Government is encouraging people not to withdraw any applications for JobSeeker if you've already put yours in. Given you have to report your income for the JobSeeker payment anyway, it says the Tax Office will work out which one you should receive. If you're getting a different kind of Government benefit like the student-only Youth Allowance and have also been stood down from your job, you should be able to receive JobKeeper. But if the $1,500 is more than you'd usually earn in a fortnight, it might impact how much you get from your other allowance.    ",By political reporter Georgia Hitch,"April 08, 2020"
18,/news/2020-04-07/coronavirus-explainer-contact-tracers-not-using-mobile-data/12117882?section=politics,Why Australia isn't using mobile data to track people potentially infected with coronavirus,"Australia is refusing to use what could be one of the most powerful weapons in the fight against coronavirus.   Many countries are using surveillance data to track down and warn individuals who have had close contact with an infected person. So why isn't Australia taking advantage of technology? State and territory contact tracing departments are relying mainly on questionnaires. Once someone is diagnosed with an infectious disease, tracers race to find every person they interacted with over the previous 14 days.    These close contacts are then notified and told to self-isolate.  ""The workload is enormous,"" Bret Hart from Curtin University said. He said with the huge workload it makes sense to ""explore new technologies to assist their daunting task"".     The Federal Government and some states, including NSW, are using aggregated, anonymised mobile data from telecommunications companies to monitor the public's movements.  But none are using an individual's mobile data for contact tracing. China, South Korea, Hong Kong and Israel are making infected people download a smartphone app to reveal their movements and contacts. Professor Hart said he backed the introduction of similar technology here.  ""Any device to make the contact tracer's job easier is not only good for them but also for the community if it helps stop the spread.""   Patrick Fair from Deakin University, who specialises in law and IT, said the Australian government can legally access citizens' mobile data. Under the Telecommunications Act 1997, governments are allowed to request access to data for many reasons, including national security.  ""The threshold in the act is quite low and by making the human disease emergency declaration under the Biosecurity Act 2015, the government has easily given itself power to get access to that information,"" Professor Fair said.  In statements provided to the ABC state and territory health departments said they did not use mobile data to contact trace for privacy reasons.   But Professor Fair advocated for governments to take contact tracing to the next level.  ""The economic impact of the shutdown is of such a magnitude that not using the most intelligent and information-based systems to combat the virus seems, to me, to be an indefensible position.""  But infectious diseases expert Trent Yarwood from James Cook University disagreed. ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should,"" Dr Yarwood said.

In surprising news, the ACT's acting chief health officer confirmed that ""staycation"" packages advertised by hotels were not banned, giving locals the green light to take up offers over the long weekend. ""The ACT Government understands the change that is being asked of Canberrans, particularly during holiday periods like Easter,"" Dr Vanessa Johnston said in a statement today. ""'Staycation' packages are not prohibited and might provide relief and respite for people in crowded homes or who are worried about their mental health and wellbeing.  ""If someone takes up this package, they must still practise good hand hygiene and maintain the physical distancing measures.""   In a marketing email to prospective guests, one hotel, Hotel Realm, said: ""To our locals, we understand the pressures of living and working from home."" ""For those needing away time while not actually going 'away' we invite you to have a staycation."" The hotel is also offering 24-hour room service and in-room exercise sessions. But while the hotel industry has largely shut down during the coronavirus crisis, staycations are entirely legal. ""Businesses should make sure they are following government measures and advice to protect their employees and customers,"" Dr Johnson said. ""If you do need to go out for essential reasons, like shopping, exercising, for medical reasons or to work, please limit the amount of interaction you have with other people.""   Chief Minister Andrew Barr spent much of the week urging Canberrans to stay at home — especially over coming Easter break — but said today that going to a hotel could still be ""within the health guidelines"". He also suggested people might want to use hotels as quiet workplaces, if they were struggling to be productive at home. ""Some people are finding that they don't have enough computers or enough bandwidth at home and they need to do some work and acquire the space, and so that's sort of appropriate and within the health guidelines,"" he said. ""Similarly, a staycation might be appropriate in the context of respite, and a little bit of a break for people. ""I wouldn't anticipate there being a massive demand, but there might be some circumstances in which it's appropriate … All of the usual rules would apply around physical distancing and hygiene and the like."" He expected greater demand for hotels as workplaces rather than as holiday breaks, to help parents ""get a little bit of quiet time"" for work.   Meanwhile, the ACT recorded two new cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours. A total of 99 cases have now been confirmed in Canberra. The new cases were both men: one aged in his 60s and the other in his 70s. One had travelled overseas recently while the other had been in close contact with someone infected earlier.   Police confirmed today that no one in Canberra has yet been fined for breaching social distancing rules. But ACT Chief Police Officer Ray Johnson warned people against trying to travel to the coast over Easter, saying New South Wales officers would be on the roads in large numbers. He also said the average speed of cars in Canberra had increased ""as a result of the lower number of cars on the road"". Police had stopped two cars recently travelling at more than twice the speed limit: one was recorded speeding at 191kph in an 80kph zone; the other at 122kph in a 60kph zone. ""I spoke to one of our traffic members this morning — he reflected on the fact that he'd seen speeds much above 20kph over the speed limit,"" Assistant Commissioner Johnson said. ""So I encourage you not to be thinking about that. ""If you're out and about on the weekend doing what you appropriately and should be doing, don't compound it by getting double demerit points and the fines that go with it."" The ACT Government has also set up a helpline ""to assist Canberrans through the challenges of COVID-19"".  The COVID-19 line will operate on (02) 6207 7244 between 8:00am and 8:00pm daily, and offer health advice, as well as information on stimulus spending and self-isolation. Asked whether the Government was encouraging Canberrans to ""dob"" on those who breach infection control measures, Mr Barr said people could use the line to report ""really bad behaviour"". But he hoped most Canberrans would focus on their own conduct and what they could control. ""So focus mostly on your own personal response,"" Mr Barr said.

And today just one new case was reported.   But while recent results align with the ACT Government's ""best-case scenario"", authorities say the gains are fragile and could be easily undone. Ever since a sharp increase in diagnoses of the respiratory disease in mid-March — when many travellers returned from overseas — the ACT's daily tally has been declining. Acting chief health officer Vanessa Johnston said the outcomes so far were ""excellent"". ""This is a great sign that our physical-distancing measures, while they are challenging and they are hard, are helping to flatten the curve,"" she said. ""But this doesn't mean we can be complacent — there will be new cases."" Ninety-seven cases of COVID-19 in total have been detected in Canberra. Two people have died. Six patients are in hospital, including three in intensive care units as of yesterday, while 47 people with the disease are isolating themselves in their homes.   Another 42 Canberrans have recovered from their infection and are no longer in quarantine. The vast majority of people with COVID-19 in the ACT — four in five — were infected while overseas or on a cruise ship. To date, authorities' efforts to find new cases have been focused on people returning from overseas or interstate. Testing has also targeted Canberrans who had close contact with such people. But Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said attention would now shift to finding how the disease was spreading inside the capital.   The Government has begun carrying out ""random tests"" of people previously ineligible for testing, as they were not regarded as being at high risk of infection. Those targeted now include health and aged-care workers who show signs of illness. Ms Stephen-Smith has invited them to undergo testing. ""We are on the lookout for community transition, which we have been saying for some time is inevitable,"" she said. ""We will see it in the ACT.""   So far, officials have been unable to identify how two people in Canberra were infected, including a man in his 80s who died on the weekend. Dr Johnston agreed his case was ""concerning"". ""This was an elderly gentleman who did not venture a lot outside his local area,"" she said. That unknown element — the number of carriers who remain undiagnosed, and even asymptomatic — is the main reason epidemiologist Mark Daniel is cautious about interpreting the latest results. Professor Daniel, of the University of Canberra's Health Research Institute, said recent signs were positive but COVID-19 was capable of spreading rapidly. ""What's surprising me is the rate at which it moved around the world … We haven't seen a pandemic arise as quickly as this."" He said the ACT would remain at risk because it was so close to the epicentre of the outbreak, Sydney. Professor Daniel said while travel restrictions had ""helped Canberra considerably"", the two cities' proximity meant prevention measures needed to stay in place for a long time.   Dr Johnston also said it was far too early to loosen limits on socialising and business, a move some sections of the community had called for. ""What we risk, when we relax these restrictions, is that we will see an uptick in cases,"" she said. She warned that, at present, the health system lacked the staff, beds and supplies to cope with a large outbreak. Ms Stephen-Smith said the recent successes would only last while people continued to do ""the right thing"" — stay at home, practise physical distancing, wash their hands and, if diagnosed, isolate themselves. ""If we abide by all of those [measures], we will slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community and we're starting to see the impact of that,"" she said.

The NT Government confirmed again this week that schools would be open next term and said families should plan for all school-aged children to be physically back in the classroom come April 20.  Education Minister Selena Uibo said the decision to keep schools open was based on the current medical advice and the direction from the Federal Government.  But she said exceptions would be made for parents who had informed their school that their child would be learning from home.  ""Some families may want to look at home schooling options, which is already available and has always been available,"" she said. Hard copy learning packs were being arranged for students staying at home without access to online learning technology. The minister wrote to teachers on Wednesday night, telling them ""education delivery in Term 2 will be determined by the school and tailored to the circumstances of students."" She said that school staff were using the four pupil-free days granted in this last week of term to develop the materials required for term two. But the push to prepare three different teaching models has drawn heavy criticism from Australian Education Union NT (AEU NT) president Jarvis Ryan, who said the approach was ""untenable"". ""We're disappointed, we're angry, we don't feel that teachers on the ground are being listened to,"" he said ""People are making decisions up in a bubble and they are not taking into account the incredible pressures that teachers are under.""    Mr Ryan said the union had fought to secure this week's pupil-free days to give teachers ""some breathing space"" but said ""instead what's happened has been a ratcheting up of pressure under multi-model delivery."" ""They're being bombarded with paperwork requests from the department about pandemic plans, are you planning for three scenarios, what are you doing about assessments?""  Mr Ryan said the union would advise its members not to perform additional work to cater for students who were at home. ""There will be one mode of teaching and learning — whether it's at school or at home,"" he said.

22,/news/2020-04-09/nt-scraps-one-to-one-solar-power-feed-in-tariff-renewables/11928988?section=politics,"One-to-one solar feed-in tariff scrapped, battery subsidies announced in NT renewables changes","The phones have been ringing off the hook at Leigh Fowkes' small solar business in Katherine this week — and not in a good way.   ""Existing clients basically straight away [saying] 'put our jobs on hold',"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Mr Fowkes said about two dozen customers had shelved plans to install rooftop solar in the wake of the sudden axing of the Northern Territory's one-to-one feed-in tariff. The generous rate at which solar system-owners were paid for excess energy sent back to the grid helped drive rooftop solar uptake in the NT from the lowest levels in the country to levels that experts warned the Top End grid had not been upgraded to manage. A 67 per cent cut to the tariff for new systems — from 24 cents for every kilowatt hour down to eight — was rolled in with the Government's announcement this week of $30 million for a large-scale battery to support the Darwin to Katherine system. Renewables Minister Dale Wakefield said the battery and $800,000 in subsidies for more rooftop solar storage were ""two huge steps forward in our plan for 50 per cent renewables by 2030."" But she refused to say why the tariff change was made without notice, when the Government had promised consultations and a draft policy to be released last year. Mr Fowkes said solar installers were not prepared for a snap announcement but knew a policy change was coming. ""We all knew how unstable the grid was and how hard it was for Power and Water to maintain the voltage et cetera,"" he said. ""But a bit of notice, and maybe even some better timing, would have been helpful."" Ms Wakefield said Labor was continuing with ""the business of government"" while dealing with the coronavirus fallout, including its renewables and energy policies.   She acknowledged recent criticism by the Utilities Commission, which commented on ""significant changes"" in the Darwin to Katherine grid, where rooftop solar had ""exceeded expectations"" and 60 megawatts of large-scale solar was due for connection in coming months. The commission said it had to approve tough new technical requirements on large-scale solar generators to head off ""serious reliability and security issues"" on the system, partly because of a lack of government progress on its promised reforms. ""That's why it's been important for us to continue this work even throughout the COVID crisis,"" Ms Wakefield said. ""We want to make sure we've got a stable and strong power system that delivers what Territorians need."" The NT Government said its large-scale battery would save government-owned Territory Generation $6.4 million and 50,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year. The author of the Government's Roadmap to Renewables report, Alan Langworthy, said Labor deserved credit for moving in the right direction, but he said there was much more reform work to be done. And he said there remained a ""very significant risk"" of a system crash on the Darwin to Katherine grid. ""It will be two years before the [large-scale] battery is up and going, and I'm not sure the current mechanisms for household use are going to change people's demand or generation model at all,"" he said. ""That still leaves the grid in quite a lot of vulnerability."" A Government spokesperson said the $800,000 set aside for battery subsidies would cover up to 130 grants. But about 12,000 households and businesses installed rooftop solar before the tariff change, according to retailer Jacana Energy. Under grandfathering arrangements, those customers will continue to receive the one-for-one rebate, surrendering it only if they move, upgrade their system capacity, or take up the battery subsidy. The Government said its tariff change was a recommendation from the roadmap report, but Mr Langworthy said the actual guidance was for the creation of a time-of-day feed-in tariff to encourage greater battery uptake. Using a time-of-day tariff, customers get paid more for their power if it is exported to the grid during a peak-demand period like the early evening. ""With net metering left in place there's no incentive for people to install a battery, so basically it's status quo,"" Mr Langworthy said. ""If the Government had in fact instituted a time-of-day tariff they could have gotten a good solid take-up of battery support delivering energy into the system when they really need it, which is in the 5:00 to 9:00 at night period."" Ms Wakefield said the Government was considering the time-of-day tariff proposal and would monitor the uptake of batteries going forward. She also said the Government would speak with small solar installers like Ms Fowkes, who were imploring the Government to allow a tariff-change grace period. ""We know that solar is still a great investment for people when people sit down and do the figures,"" she said. ""We know that solar business will continue to thrive in the Territory because Territorians have been voting with their feet because of the savings they can make on their bill.""",By Jacqueline Breen,"April 09, 2020"

The Australia Council has announced the winners and losers of its latest four-year funding process, with Restless Dance Theatre joining the likes of La Mama Theatre in Melbourne and The Blue Room Theatre in Western Australia in having its main source of revenue axed. The company, which provides paid work for dancers with disabilities, currently receives more than $300,000 per year as part of a four-year funding arrangement, and had applied to the Australia Council to increase that figure. Instead, its funding was cut entirely — a move that has left Ryan devastated. ""I was absolutely shocked,"" she said. ""I thought that our application was very strong and we have such a point of difference to everyone.""   Arts Industry Council of SA chairwoman Gail Kovatseff was critical of the decision to take funding away from an employer of artists with disabilities. ""I was profoundly shocked, and the reason why I was profoundly shocked was that they are not just a nationally regarded company, but an internationally regarded company, working in diversity,"" she said. ""Diversity is a strong criteria for the Australia Council."" She said while Australia Council funding to South Australia had ""been in decline for some time"", the loss would not only be felt this year but would have a ""cumulative impact"". Ms Kovatseff said smaller companies like Restless Dance Theatre were already disadvantaged because they did not have the staff to target alternative financial sources, such as philanthropy. A spokeswoman for the Australia Council acknowledged that Restless Dance Theatre was highly regarded within the national dance sector, a fact that had been recognised by those who assessed its funding application. However, she also said competition for the four-year funding was fierce and demand had continued to exceed the budget capacity.   Some within the dance sector are bitter that Restless Dance Theatre lost its funding while others including the Australian Dance Theatre had their funding renewed. A spokesman for the Australian Dance Theatre did not want to compare the two funding bids. However, he said the company would be supporting Restless Dance Theatre and the two troupes were in ongoing communications about how that would work. The news of the funding cut came less than two weeks after Ryan was named as the winner of the 2020 Australia Council Award for Dance. Battling multiple sclerosis, which ended her dance career, Ms Ryan has been locked in self-isolation for three weeks.   She is spending much of her time on her mobile phone and computer trying to save the company. ""I moved to Adelaide for this job and really work has been my life,"" she said. ""I've had two Zooms [online meetings] today and I ended up in tears, but I'm also quite a strong person when I get a fire in the belly. ""I just really believe in the work that we do and we need to find a way."" Almost 150 arts organisations across Australia will get money from the annual allocation of nearly $32 million. Nine of those organisations are from South Australia, a drop from 11 in the current funding period. To soften the blow, the Australia Council will provide ""transitional"" funding for one year to companies which missed out. For Restless Dance Theatre, that equates to about $217,000 — a figure which would lead to job cuts, as well as less paid work for dancers. Beyond that, Ryan fears for the future of the company that had been set to tour internationally again, before travel was restricted to halt the spread of coronavirus.",By Matthew Smith,"April 09, 2020"

There are nine schools on South Australia's Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in some of the country's most disadvantaged Indigenous communities, dotted across 105,000 square kilometres of central Australia. The area has gone into effective lockdown to try to prevent the risk of coronavirus spreading, with only essential workers allowed in. The Amata Anangu School, nearly 1,500 kilometres from Adelaide, posted on social media that ""school staff may be away for a little while at the beginning of next term"". ""We created home learning packs for all students,"" the post said. ""We can't wait to see all of the amazing work that our students have done when we get back.""    Other schools on the APY Lands have also begun distributing home learning packs. The Australian Education Union (AEU) said it had concerns about how remote schools would be managed amid the coronavirus pandemic. ""We do have a number of concerns about how term two might look and how they might be impacted by any quarantine processes,"" AEU SA president Lara Golding said. ""We've been trying to seek clarification from the Minister and from the Department about their plans and arrangements for term two.""   Ms Golding said there were also concerns about the provision of cleaners and sanitary products at remote schools. She said some teachers are also coming back from interstate, with border closures complicating matters further. ""If teachers are required to self-isolate, they must have access to paid leave to do so, and a sufficient supply of groceries,"" she said. In a statement, a spokesperson for the South Australian Department for Education said teachers would be allowed to leave remote communities, with professional development planned in preparation for term two. ""Staff on the APY Lands have been supported where they have travel plans for the term break,"" the spokesperson said.   However, quarantine requirements had not been finalised, with two weeks' isolation expected to impact term two schedules. ""The department is currently working with local and state decision makers to finalise the requirements of staff on returning to the APY Lands during the COVID-19 period and will support staff in implementing these agreements,"" the spokesperson said. The State Government last week declined to move a group of elders and vulnerable people from the APY Lands to isolate in Adelaide amid concerns of a viral outbreak. When asked why the support was extended to teachers and not elders, a State Government spokesperson said ""the advice to the Government remains that it is safer for Aboriginal people to remain in their communities"".   A statement posted on the APY Lands' official Facebook page last week indicated education staff were exempt from coronavirus border protection measures as they were essential staff.   ""These people do not need to undertake isolation as long as they show no signs of coronavirus, have not been in contact with anyone known to have the virus, and haven't been overseas in the past two weeks,"" the statement read. ""They will liaise with community contacts and follow safe practices, keeping away from communities to keep everyone safe."" However, APY Lands General Manager Richard King said teachers were allowed to come and go as an essential service, but they would still need to isolate for 14 days – preferably in their homes in communities. ""They are working with kids … they will have to isolate for 14 days, anyone returning will have to under the Biosecurity Act,"" Mr King said. ""Whether they do it on the Lands or off the Lands is being discussed — that decision sits with SA Police."" He said the towns of Coober Pedy and Marla were being considered as possible locations for staff to isolate away from communities. Schools across the country — including those on the APY Lands — are exploring online teaching options. The 12th Closing the Gap report showed Aboriginal children still trail far behind non-Indigenous children in literacy, numeracy and writing skills. University of Newcastle professor of Aboriginal Studies John Lester said these results would likely worsen in remote communities due to coronavirus.   ""I think coronavirus will heighten the gap and increase it — Aboriginal communities will end up in a double jeopardy,"" Professor Lester said. ""Where communities have ready access to technologies and they have literate parents in their households they can get the necessary support, they will learn the system and power on. ""Remote Aboriginal communities that have limited access to digital technologies, limited numeracy and literacy skills — and obviously suffering enormous amounts of overcrowding in housing, poverty and limited access to web technology — will get double jeopardy and that's a compounding process.""   Schools are often the biggest industry in remote communities and Professor Lester said having them closed, or offering reduced services, would drastically limit access to technology. ""There's been limited improvements in learning outcomes for these kids and we do not want to double the disadvantage by them not having access to online … syllabuses and technologies,"" he said. However, Professor Lester said that most Aboriginal students attend school in urban settings and results for that cohort could improve, if adequate technology and student engagement practices were in place. The Education Department confirmed all sites in the APY Lands had high-speed fibre optic internet connection, and options to help students participate in online learning were being investigated. ""While we're looking to expand access to online learning for students across South Australia, including in the APY Lands, learning materials will also be available in hard copy where appropriate, for example where an entire school or class does not have access to a computer or the internet at home,"" the spokesperson said.

The package will include about $5 million for technology and protective equipment and targeted funding will be provided to Aboriginal community-controlled organisations. The Government has also announced a plan to help Victorians experiencing homelessness who need to self-isolate. Housing Minister Richard Wynne has announced $8 million will be put towards using decommissioned aged-care homes at four Melbourne locations to house 200 people sleeping rough, and provide them with healthcare.   To be eligible for the program, people must either be waiting on test results, have a positive coronavirus diagnosis, be required to self-isolate but have nowhere to do so, or have been discharged from hospital and require accommodation to recover. ""People without secure accommodation are at greater risk of contracting coronavirus because they can't self-isolate or quarantine, this will help keep them safe and slow the spread of virus,'' Mr Wynne said.   The housing will be operated by Anglicare Victoria, Brotherhood of St Laurence, Launch Housing, Sacred Heart Mission and VincentCare Victoria with outreach staff providing 24-hour support. Mr Wynne also said public housing tenants' rent assessments would not be affected by any Federal Government financial stimulus payments over the coming months.   As the country gears up for a different kind of Easter, authorities around Australia are pleading with people to remain at home and not travel to regional or coastal areas this weekend. On Thursday, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville said police would be checking on travellers on roads and in tourist hotspots to make sure they were complying with coronavirus restrictions. State MP for South Barwon  Darren Cheeseman has called for Surf Coast Shire Council to close all beaches this weekend to deter people from travelling to the coast. ""They should be closed to all activity, including surfing, swimming, fishing, walking, and sunbathing,"" he said in a Facebook post on Thursday.   Meanwhile, Victorian emergency departments have reported a 20 per cent drop in patients with injuries as the state's stage three lockdown continues. The Department of Health said there had been a reduction from an average of 5,000 patients per day to 4,100 per day. But while there had been an overall drop in the number of people presenting to emergency departments, some areas have seen an unexpected spike during the lockdown.   Heather Cleland, director of the Victorian Adult Burns Service at The Alfred, said the hospital had received ""an influx of patients with severe burns"" from home cooking and barbecuing. ""If you are going to be cooking, please pay attention,"" she said. ""And if you're going to be barbecuing, please, please do not throw accelerants like methylated spirits or petrol onto the fire to try and get it going."" However, hospitals and medical professionals have expressed concern that emergency department numbers might be down because people were delaying vital treatment.   Stroke Foundation chief executive Sharon McGowan said some patients who were worried about being a burden on the health system or contracting COVID-19 at a hospital were not seeking help when they needed it. ""We've already heard from our clinicians on the ground of two cases where individuals with the early signs of stroke actually delayed calling triple zero,"" Ms McGowan said. Ambulance services across Victoria have also seen a 20 per cent drop in emergency calls prompting Ms McGowan to urge Australians not to play down medical emergencies during the pandemic. ""We must be looking after ourselves in Australia. Every stroke is a medical emergency, every stroke is a triple zero call.""    ",,"April 10, 2020"
26,/news/2020-04-09/victoria-coronavirus-cases-rise/12135968?section=politics,"Coronavirus cases in Victoria rise to 1,228 as police urge people to stay home for Easter","Cases of coronavirus in Victoria have risen to 1,228 after 16 more people were diagnosed with COVID-19 overnight.   Fifty people are in hospital including 13 people in intensive care, up from 12 who were in intensive care on Wednesday. The number of deaths remains at 12. Police Minister Lisa Neville urged people to stay at home this weekend and away from coastal communities, but conceded that legally people could visit holiday homes they owned.  ""You can't go to an Airbnb, you can't camp, you can't caravan, you can't boat, you can't fish. Those are very clear rules,"" she said.  ""You can't catch up with friends or family that don't currently live with you."" Ms Neville said Victoria Police would be visiting coastal and regional communities making sure people were complying with coronavirus restrictions, and would be out on the roads doing road safety checks.   Ms Neville said where there were ""blatant"" breaches of the Chief Health Officer's rules, people would be fined. ""These are really tough measures, we all understand that this will be a very different Easter and it should be,"" she said.   Ms Neville said some beaches had closed completely while some had closed but were still allowing people to surf, swim and walk for exercise if they lived locally. ""Travelling from Melbourne to Lorne to surf is inappropriate,"" she said.   Police carried out 1,065 spot checks in 24 hours and issued another 78 on-the-spot fines. Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said the main reason fines were being issued was because people continued to gather together. ""They're still doing dinner parties, Airbnb-type parties, large groups of people together. We're having people drink in the streets, drink outside with a group of mates in parks and things like that,"" he said. ""Totally unacceptable behaviour.""   Victoria Police fined a man understood to be a member of an ultra-orthodox Jewish community for holding a group prayer session in Ripponlea in Melbourne's south-east.   In a statement, police said the man was fined $1,652 for failing to adhere to directives designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. Police said they had also attended the same premises on Wednesday and issued several warnings ""to a person about organising and holding gatherings."" The other men who were at the venue were being investigated and further fines may be issued. Other examples of people who were fined included a man driving in South Melbourne who claimed he was out to buy a bottle of water, despite living in Wantirna South, and a group of six who had gathered together after previously being warned by police. The group of six told police they were ""just chilling"".   But while some breaches may be obvious, Victorian crossbenchers are calling for a review of some of the most draconian regulations, including directions prohibiting people sitting alone in public spaces and going fishing. The Reason Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens said many of the restrictions around solitary activities needed to be fine-tuned to make them sustainable for the long-term. Deputy Commissioner Patton admitted police were also fining offenders who were caught breaking criminal laws — a practice that has been criticised by lawyers. ""When we're charging them for offences such as drugs, burglary and theft they're also getting infringements issued to them,"" he said. The Deputy Commissioner said officers had been instructed to focus on breaches that were ""deliberate, blatant and obvious"" and assured people there were ""checks and balances"" in place. ""We're not perfect police officers, we will get this wrong on some occasions but when we get it wrong we'll fix it and that's what we're about,"" he said. Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson has called for roadblocks to be put in place along Victoria's Great Ocean Road to stop holiday-makers from breaching coronavirus restrictions. Under the stage three shutdown, people are legally allowed to travel to properties they own. Ms Henderson told the ABC those who were travelling illegitimately could be fined and forced to turn around.  ""There are still Airbnbs and rental homes out there on the market, which is of course prohibited,"" she said.   Ms Neville said the Chief Health Officer had not indicated there was a need for roadblocks to stop people travelling to the regions and the coast, saying she had a ""great deal of faith in Victorians"". Airbnb Australia country manager Susan Wheeldon said the company would cooperate with police on any investigations into non-essential travel. ""If you're thinking of an Easter getaway this long weekend, change your plans immediately and stay home,"" she said in a statement. ""Airbnb is extremely serious about supporting efforts to combat COVID-19."" Ms Wheeldon said the company had contacted hosts and guests to remind them to comply with local laws and had been ""actively discouraging"" hosts from inappropriately marketing listings using terms related to COVID-19, such as quarantine. ""We won't hesitate to take action, such as removal from our platform, against anyone who violates the policies we've put in place to help ensure the public's safety,"" she said.   Operation Nexus will continue this year over the Easter long weekend with an increased focus on breath testing, drug testing, and speed but booze buses will not be operating. Road Policing Assistant Commissioner Libby Murphy said rather than roadblocks, police would be focusing on enforcement and visibility. Ms Neville also said it was too early to speculate on when AFL should come back, saying it was ""way too early"" to lift restrictions. The Department of Transport has closed boat ramps, piers and jetties across Victoria in a bid to reinforce that all forms of recreational boating were not permitted under stage three restrictions. It comes after a man had to be rescued by police on Wednesday night after he crashed into rocks near Portsea while trying to reach Tasmania.   Recreational boating includes all forms of human-powered boating, including canoeing, kayaking, surf skiing, stand-up paddleboarding, rowing, all forms of powered boating such as jet skiing and all forms of wind-powered boating such as yachting, kitesurfing and windsurfing. Commercial shipping, commercial boating, land, port and waterway management functions and emergency access are exempt. Meanwhile, a significantly higher number of calls are being made to the Victoria Police assistance line. More than 600 calls are being made a day from people reporting others who breach physical-distancing rules.   Over the last two weeks, 22,500 coronavirus-related calls have been made, including 3,781 calls to report mass gatherings, 2,117 for people suspected of breaching social-isolation protocols and 1,770 for businesses breaching the restrictions. In February, the assistance line received about 61,000 calls, which was consistent with average call volumes in previous months. But in March that figure blew out to 69,000 — the highest number of calls per month since the police line launched in July last year. The line is likely to receive 80,000 calls by the end of April. Last Friday, 1,000 calls to the hotline were redirected to the DHHS website or the National Coronavirus Helpline because they were general enquiries.  ",,"April 09, 2020"
27,/news/2020-04-09/golf-keeps-aussies-on-course-during-covid19/12119570?section=politics,Golf a 'reason to get up in the morning' and keeping Aussies on course amid coronavirus,"The coronavirus outbreak has brought most sport to a standstill, but one game is giving some Australians respite from the ongoing uncertainty.   Despite increasing efforts to limit life outside the home, golf has been allowed to continue in most states — as long as clubs adopt strict conditions in keeping their courses open. The move has been praised by players and medical experts concerned about the potential health risks of social restrictions on older people.   Sydney resident John Parker has been playing at Marrickville Golf Club for 40 years and he has never experienced conditions like those under COVID-19. Players are restricted to groups of two and must keep 1.5 metres apart at all times. Carts cannot be shared, hand sanitiser is freely available, and the clubhouse is closed. Despite the extreme measures, the retiree is thrilled to be out in the fresh air. ""I just love it, it's a reason to get up early in the morning,"" he said. Golf is one of his last remaining social activities.  He is unable to visit his grandchildren and his outings to the theatre stopped weeks ago.     ""[Coronavirus restrictions] have had a big impact on my wife and I,"" he said. ""We always went out on a Tuesday night and that's no longer possible. ""Not being able to see the grandchildren has been one of the biggest impacts, but we talk to them everyday on the phone.""   He said the potential of losing golf would be a difficult blow to many people. ""The elderly and retired generation really look forward to it and it's devastating if they can't play,"" he said. For fellow golfer Peter Harrison the game has been a respite from the uncertainty of the world around him. ""It's definitely a release,"" he said. ""Once you're on the course you switch off from everything else and that just brings you back to where you used to be."" While most health experts agree that self-isolating is a top priority, researchers are also concerned about the consequences of residents remaining inactive.     Australians suffer from high rates of cardiovascular disease, with factors like being overweight or obese contributing to around 119 deaths from the chronic illness every day. Dr Erin Howden from the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute said scientists know how quickly the body can deteriorate due to inactivity thanks to the Dallas Bed Rest study. In 1966, five men young men were confined to bed for three weeks, causing their cardiovascular health to plummet.   Researchers, including Dr Howden, tracked down these participants 30 years later and found that the weeks of bed rest were more damaging to their bodies than decades of ageing. She said the research highlights the importance of keeping active during this pandemic. ""We are very concerned about the effects of COVID-19 and how this might impact individuals' cardiovascular health,"" she said. ""Golf is one of the lucky sports at the moment allowing people to get out. ""It's really important to avoid being sedentary as much as possible … so I think it's a great activity."" But keeping the courses open has been a balancing act for clubs, according to Marrickville Golf Club president Andrew Tighe. ""We're trying to do our best to be responsible to the community and to our members, however we are also keen to keep to the course open if we can,"" he said. ""We are constantly monitoring the news and we are being very diligent to comply with every directive the government gives.""     Despite some initial confusion and inconsistencies across the country, golf can go ahead in most states except for Victoria and the Northern Territory. Golf NSW spokesman Graeme Phillipson said it is a challenge every club has had to face. ""There are individual clubs that have chosen to close and that's their individual decision,"" he said. ""While the NSW Government is allowing people to play golf we are encouraging clubs to do so [stay open]."" With the coronavirus restrictions expected to last for months ahead, Mr Parker said he is determined to make the most of his favourite outdoor exercise. ""As long as I'm capable of playing and we're allowed to play I will still play,"" he said.    ",ABC Radio Sydney      By                                 Matt Bamford,"April 09, 2020"

Tough restrictions on travel in and out of Wuhan, China were only lifted in the last 24 hours, and the city's airport whirred back into action along with many other transport hubs in Hubei province. The cargo flight, operated by Chinese carrier Suparna Airlines, arrived in Sydney after 9:00pm on Wednesday, and is the first flight from Wuhan to land at Australia's busiest airport since late January. 3,213 people have died in Hubei province since the COVID-19 outbreak began, with close to 68,000 confirmed cases in the region. ""This flight will be carrying up to 90 tonnes of much needed medical supplies,"" a spokesperson for the Home Affairs Department told the ABC. ""Flights like this are crucial in ensuring the ongoing supply of these critical goods."" The arrival of the flight is likely to prompt quarantine concerns, given the special exemptions from Australia's strict coronavirus control regime for air crews.

The 52-year-old man was charged with serious assault of a public officer over the alleged incident at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital on Wednesday. He is due to appear in court on June 30. ""I was disgusted to hear that report and concerned for the wellbeing of that particular nurse, nobody should treat our health workers like that,"" Health Minister Steven Miles said. Queensland's total of known coronavirus cases now sits at 965 following the latest 13 infections.   Mr Miles said the rate was much lower than in late March, adding that in the past week, there were 93 new cases, down from the peak week, which recorded 380. He said most people who fell ill would only have a mild illness and just 5 per cent were forecast to end up in intensive care. ""Other countries have seen up to 7 per cent death rates,"" he said. ""If we can keep our death rate well below 1 per cent, that will be amongst the best in the world and that's what we're aiming for.""   Mr Miles said modelling suggested the state would need about 1,000 intensive care beds during a coronavirus peak, which was less than the current number available in the public and private health systems. ""We already have more capacity than we anticipate ever needing,"" he said. ""We've ordered extra ventilators, identified all the ones available in the state, we have anaesthetic machines that can be converted into ventilators, we have manufactures who are re-kitting to make ventilators."" There are 897 people in mandatory quarantine in Queensland, in hotels, and police have issued 289 infringement notices, up to $13,000, for breaching public health emergency orders. ""I know police had to replace the waterfilled barricades with concrete barricades,"" Mr Miles said of the border-control measures. ""Everyone should be aware the police are out there enforcing these rules, they're on the border, they're at the beaches, they're making sure everyone complies."" Mr Miles urged people not to seek out ""loopholes"" in the rules and to spend the Easter long weekend at home. He said the two-guest rule was a concession to make the current climate ""a bit more bearable"", but said if authorities found people were abusing the allowance, they might have to revisit it.   ""We really don't want to,"" he said. ""It's not about isolating people from their networks, it's about keeping them socially distant."" Mr Miles also said the Queensland chief health officer had published areas considered to be COVID-19 hot spots around the country, including local government areas largely in Greater Sydney, as well as the Central Coast of New South Wales.

One of the cases is a close contact of a previously identified case. Three of the cases are healthcare workers who have worked at the North West Regional Hospital or the North West Private Hospital, or both. The Outbreak Management Team is already identifying and contacting any person who has had close contact with any of these staff and will ensure necessary actions are taken. In addition, Public Health Services is also following up household and social contacts of all confirmed cases. The latest cases were announced after the Tasmanian Government warned there would be ""choppers in the sky"" this long weekend, ensuring people stay home for Easter. Premier Peter Gutwein said there would be a statewide police ""blitz"" and an ""effective lockdown"" in the north-west, where a COVID-19 outbreak investigation is continuing around the North West Regional Hospital (NWRH) and North West Private Hospital (NWPH) ""To be frank, today the gloves come off,"" Mr Gutwein said. ""The period of education is over. ""We still have Tasmanians that are flaunting the rules. ""I have been fair, I have been reasonable and I have taken every step and every precaution that we can to save lives. But we will only save lives if Tasmanians follow the rules. ""Today we'll be putting helicopters up. There will be eyes in the sky.""  Tasmania has 107 confirmed cases of coronavirus — 23 of which Health Minister Sarah Courtney said were linked to the outbreak in the north-west.     The Premier described the next five days as ""the most critical"". ""It is not good enough to be hearing reports of campers and trailers heading to the east coast. It's simply not good enough to think that you can blatantly break these rules,"" he said. ""People's lives are being put at risk.""   He said they would be paying special attention to the north-west coast and people should not be surprised if they were stopped by police and asked what they were doing. ""Don't be surprised if you're at a shack and you get a knock on the door,"" he said. ""If you don't have a reasonable excuse then you will be asked to leave or you will be summonsed and charged. ""Our shack communities, our seaside villages are largely retirement villages. We don't want you travelling there.""    Speaking on the outbreak in the north-west, Ms Courtney said 15 of the confirmed cases are health care workers at either the NWRH, NWPH or both and two are close contacts. Five are current patients — four received care at both the public and private hospitals, but are now inpatients at the NWRH and one is at the Mersey in Devonport. There is also one discharged patient.    Chief medical officer of the NWRH Tony Lawler said the situation in the north-west was one of containment and analysis. ""Through contact tracing and roster review, there are now approximately 60 staff members stood down in the NWRH,"" he said. ""Exact numbers are difficult to ascertain given the fact that this crosses across all professional groups, across the Mersey and the NWRH.""

Ian Pearce is blaming age, health and union harassment as he heads out the door. Mr Pearce was made acting general manager of Glamorgan Spring Bay Council at the end of March after Chris Schroeder, appointed to the top job in August 2019, tendered his resignation. At the time, the Australian Services Union (ASU) claimed Mr Schroeder was told by the council he would have been fired if he didn't quit. Mr Pearce this week told Mayor Debbie Wisby he planned to resign too. The union had put nine questions to the council for its next meeting, focused on a spate of council worker resignations, outstanding compensation claims, and Mr Pearce's ratepayer-funded stay at a bed and breakfast operation run by Cr Wisby's sister-in-law. Mr Pearce told the ABC that Cr Wisby had his backing, but that two months out from his 70th birthday he had decided continuing in the role simply was not worth it. ""The union's sending emails wanting this and that to be placed on agendas, and all these questions about me,"" Mr Pearce said. ""I'm thinking they're doing this and we've got this virus pandemic going on, and they think this is important because they've got a vendetta against the Mayor? ""It really makes me angry."" Mr Pearce, the former general manager of West Tamar Council, had planned to travel between Launceston and Triabunna during his planned six months in the job, but said past health issues made him nervous about contracting coronavirus, and that working remotely was difficult because he didn't ""really have the computer skills to work well from home"". As for the questions put to the council, Mr Pearce said he ""couldn't care less"". ""I'm quite happy to answer them,"" he said. ""I just think at this time they're irrelevant."" He said his wife had unknowingly organised the stay at Cr Wisby's relative's accommodation. ""I've got more important things to do than that, honestly.""   Aaron De La Torre from the Australian Services Union said the union was seeking transparency from the Glamorgan Spring Bay Council. ""We do have a problem with the way the council is running,"" Mr De La Torre said. ""I wouldn't call it a vendetta, I'd suggest we're calling for accountability. ""Whilst the problems remain, we'll be supporting our members 100 per cent of the way."" Cr Wisby declined to comment. In a series of letters late last year, the ASU alleged the Mayor was making staff feel bullied and harassed, which she has denied.  The council has since been ordered to develop guidelines for how the mayor, councillors and council staff should interact, and it has also been found non-compliant with the Local Government Act on several counts.  In addition, it is in financial strife after running out of money to finish a $6 million pipeline for salmon company Tassal. Minister for Local Government Mark Shelton said he was aware of reports Mr Pearce may be resigning. ""The general manager position is an operational matter for the council to manage,"" Mr Shelton said. ""The Director of Local Government and I continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that essential services are being delivered, the council is addressing the requirements of the Local Government Act 1993, and the council is meeting the expectations of the Glamorgan Spring Bay community.""",By state political reporter Emily Baker,"April 08, 2020"

Intrastate border restrictions are in place in WA, separating each of the state's nine region's from Perth, and West Australians have repeatedly been told not to travel to holiday homes or away from their primary place of residence. Fyfe drew the attention of Margaret River locals when he pulled into a beach car park at Gas Bay on Friday morning. The ABC approached the 28-year-old for comment as he walked back to a car after his surf but he declined, asking instead that his privacy be respected.   Subsequent calls were then placed to Fremantle Dockers management and Fyfe's personal manager, Jason Dover, but neither was prepared to offer comment other than to say he was driving trucks for his father, picking up a delivery of lime in Margaret River. Dockers Media manager Luke Morfesse said Fyfe was simply taking the opportunity to surf in lieu of exercise. At a media conference on Thursday afternoon, WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson confirmed police were investigating the incident. But after reviewing the matter, police released a statement on Thursday night clearing Fyfe of any wrongdoing.   ""It has been confirmed that Mr Fyfe entered the region in order to provide transport services and was waiting for a truck to be loaded when he went surfing,"" the statement said. ""As a result, Mr Fyfe had a valid exemption and was compliant with directions regarding regional travel.   ""It has further been established that Mr Fyfe did not breach social distancing requirements. ""The intent of the directions is to reduce travel in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Western Australia. ""Exemptions for regional travel do apply, but exempt travellers must only travel as required and must only stay in the region for as long as it takes to complete the essential service."" Commissioner Chris Dawson said the interpretation of the law had been examined and it had been determined that Fyfe did not commit any breaches.   ""The spirit of the law is that people apply common sense and only move to another region for the purposes of performing an essential service,"" Mr Dawson said. ""I will change my directions if I learn of people's behaviours putting others at risk. Fyfe was photographed with the captain of the Australian hockey team Aran Zalewski. Hockey Australia released a brief statement in response to enquiries from the ABC. ""When Aran is not required at Hockey Australia's High Performance Program as part of the Kookaburras, his primary place of residence is in Margaret River,"" the statement said.

The latest Halls Creek cases mean there are now 17 confirmed coronavirus cases in the Kimberley, a situation that has been a substantial concern for health authorities given the vulnerability of the population in this region. The Government has been desperate to avoid COVID-19 transmission through Aboriginal communities, fearing the Indigenous population is particularly vulnerable to the virus. But WA's increase in overall case numbers remains low, with another 14 confirmed infections overnight taking the state's tally to 495. WA's COVID-19 death toll remains at six.   Health Minister Roger Cook said the continued slow pace of infections was encouraging. ""We are now seeing some wonderful numbers over a number of days,"" Mr Cook said. But Mr Cook played down the prospect of the low case numbers resulting in an easing of social restrictions leading into the Easter long weekend. ""Let's just see a sustained period of low numbers,"" he said. ""Then we can look at what the opportunities and challenges that presents us are.""   The latest Halls Creek infections mean four healthcare workers in that community have been confirmed as coronavirus cases. The two new cases were already in self-isolation and were close contacts of those previously infected, Mr Cook said. ""We are very confident we have no Aboriginal patients or members of the community exposed to those workers,"" he said. ""We are keeping a very close eye on that."" A nursing team was flown to the Kimberley last week to provide extra support, with significant numbers of healthcare workers in the region being required to isolate. The initial outbreak there saw even more drastic travel restrictions enacted for the Kimberley compared to those enforced in the rest of WA, with non-essential movement between local government areas prohibited. Four of WA's new cases come from the Artania cruise ship, which has been responsible for dozens of infected patients being treated in Perth hotels or hospitals. Another 13 crew members were taken off that vessel yesterday, but more than 400 foreign citizens remain on board.   Overall, cruise ships are responsible for 37 per cent of WA's COVID-19 infections. Six cruise ships are currently in or near WA waters and Premier Mark McGowan repeated his message to them to not attempt to dock at any of the state's ports. The Radiance of the Seas is close to Cape Leeuwin and five other cruise ships are tracking across the Great Australian Bight. Mr McGowan said the ships had a total of 6,000 crew on board and he said they should not try to dock at Fremantle, Bunbury or Geraldton ports. Another cruise ship, The World, which had previously been anchored off Fremantle and has no passengers on board, is now off Geraldton. The World is believed to be the largest private residential ship on the planet.   Mr McGowan said it was ""doing laps"" in open waters but ""we don't know why"". ""We essentially have a very strong message to all of the cruise ships. They should keep going,"" Mr McGowan said. ""That is the Commonwealth's message. We are at one with the Commonwealth. There's no requirement for them to come into Fremantle or Western Australia, and frankly they're not wanted."" Testing criteria in WA have been substantially broadened from this morning, with anyone who has had a fever within the past few days or who currently has respiratory symptoms urged to be checked. That includes anyone with a cough, shortness of breath or sore throat.   Previously, strict criteria governed whether someone was eligible to be tested — with hundreds turned away from the state's COVID clinics in the past few weeks. Mr Cook said between 30 and 40 people attended the Fiona Stanley Hospital clinic by 10:00am today, compared to 45 for all of yesterday. ""We expected a rush this morning,"" he said. ""Expanding the testing criteria ensures we will have a good line of sight and will provide us with extra confidence."" The state has also launched a new $450,000 mental health campaign, encouraging people to remain connected and active while social restrictions continue.    ",By Jacob Kagi,"April 09, 2020"

Scott Morrison's brand has been damaged, as he wings his way back to Australia from Hawaii, a trifle shop-soiled and humiliated. And all because Morrison and his office thought they could engineer silence on a family holiday. As so often in politics, it's the cover-up that gets you. No-one begrudges the fellow going on holiday with his wife and lovely girls who have probably seen less of their dad this year than any in their short lives.  And he's undoubtedly knackered from a hectic year in which he pulled off a miracle election win.   But it's highly inadvisable to fudge on your whereabouts or when you're going to return within radar. This is not about preserving the PM's privacy, the privacy of his young family or questions of their security. Where he goes for a family holiday isn't particularly important but confirming he's clocked off, when he's coming back on duty and who's taken his place is important.   When it was briefed out on Monday that the PM was on holidays, it was explained he'd be on a ""couple of quick days of leave"". But as the PM revealed to 2GB on Friday morning, he texted Labor leader Anthony Albanese that day to inform him he'd be on a week's holiday. There was no official public note issued of his absence and when one Press Gallery journalist inquired with the Deputy Prime Minister's office as to whether Michael McCormack was Acting PM, the journalist was referred back to the PM's Office. And when a couple of journos asked the PMO to confirm the boss was in Hawaii, they were told this was incorrect.  Here's a tip for the PM's minders: don't compound a fudge with a fib. Of course, any Morrison family holiday was going to attract his critics, because the haters are going to hate, just as a holiday taken by Julia Gillard or Kevin Rudd at a time of community difficulty would have been the subject of haranguing commentary by those in the conservative media. But what started as a social media storm, whipped up by the predictable hashtag army, morphed into a question of leadership and judgment when the calamity of the bushfires mounted. If Gladys Berejiklian's declaration of a state of emergency in NSW hadn't already made Morrison sweat a little more in his Hawaiian shirt, the tragedy at Buxton made the continuation of his holiday untenable. The deaths of two volunteer firies, who themselves have young families, only served to further embarrass Morrison, despite the fact that the PM is as helpless as most of us are in the face of these terrible blazes. ""I don't hold a hose, mate, and I don't sit in a control room,"" Morrison told 2GB radio host John Stanley from Hawaii. ""That's the brave people who … are doing that job. But I know that Australians would want me back at this time … of these fatalities. ""So I'll happily come back and do that."" Morrison can be grateful that Anthony Albanese has been very measured this week. Imagine if it had been Rudd or Gillard who'd gone on holiday in similar circumstances? The contrast with their opponent, volunteer firefighter Tony Abbott, would have been devastating. Abbott would have been seen daily, doing as he's done for years, fighting the flames in fluoro, ash stained on his face.   Albanese has visited members of the Rural Fire Service, making breakfast for volunteers, but has constrained his commentary. Morrison will return to Sydney on Saturday, his office says, two days before the scheduled end of his holiday. His job will not be to hold a hose, but to empathise, to thank emergency staff and to offer any practical help required.   But a restoration of his public image, complete with an on-camera expression of his ""deep regret"" for not being in Australia at a time of tragedy, will not be his only challenge. It is now very clear that the Coalition must recalibrate its climate and energy policies. Amid the smoke haze, the community horror and angst, this is a point of real clarity. Morrison's attempt last week to reassure Sydneysiders concerned by the incessant bushfire haze, by asserting he'd seen it all before, didn't cut it. Nor does it now. The Morrison Government has reached a point in the cycle of climate policy very similar to the point reached by John Howard in 2006-7 during the millennium drought.   Howard found himself on the wrong side of the public mood on climate change. And he did something that still seems remarkable: he announced support for an emissions trading scheme. Similarly, Morrison and the Coalition have been left stranded by a rapidly shifting public sentiment. The tide's gone out. And even worse, the PM's Hawaiian holiday may have punctured itself into the conscience of the very people who he claims landed him political salvation on May 18, the so-called Quiet Australians. Indeed, it might be the only political barney they've taken any notice of since the election. And it's not flattering.",By political editor Andrew Probyn,"December 22, 2019"
36,/news/2019-12-07/scott-morrison-australian-public-sector-sidelined-for-ministers/11775144?section=politics,Inside the public service shakeup: what it really says about Morrison's Government,"Shortly after the federal election, I had a conversation with a figure at the very centre of the Government.  As we raked over where the election had left the political conversation, I noted the Prime Minister's repeated emphasis on getting on with delivering services to Australians in his public statements. Did this suggest that a politician so driven by marketing memes had detected a weariness with the ideological wars of politics among disconnected voters, and recognised political self-interest in shaping both the Government's message, and its agenda, around the basics of government service delivery? Did this mean the Government might abandon some of its ideological warfare against institutions? ""Don't be ridiculous,"" this person snorted. ""If anything, this Government is more ideologically driven than Abbott. They want to win the culture wars they see in education, in the public service, in all of our institutions, and they'll come for the ABC too, of course. There will be a big cleanout at the top of the public service, but Morrison will wait for a while to do that. They believe the Left has been winning the war for the last 20 years and are determined to turn the tables. Morrison will just be craftier about the way he goes about it."" There have been many occasions to remember this conversation — and its rather extraordinary reflection on who seems to have been winning the ideological battle — over the intervening six months.    No more so than amid the anger expressed about the Government's move on Thursday to slash the number of government departments and sack five departmental secretaries. The arts community, in particular, are angry and alarmed that there won't be a department with ""arts"" in the title. But it is important to go beyond just the symbolism of what the Prime Minister announced this week, and also to put it in the context of the contempt for accountability that he and his ministers have shown since their re-election, particularly in the Angus Taylor affair. First, a bit of boring old process. The Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the public service last year, headed by former Telstra boss David Thodey. The Government received the review's final report in September. It hasn't yet gone to Cabinet. Yet, this week, the Government embarked on a major overhaul of the structure, personnel and purpose of the public service which it says ""hits the theme"" of the review. No, no-one mentioned the vibe of the thing.   So having spent a great deal of experts' time, and taxpayer money, the Government announces huge changes in the public service without linking them directly to recommendations from the body it established itself. Oh, except, sorry, it was the same Government that started the review but, you guessed it, a different prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Among the many contributions made to, and by, the Thodey review was a paper on the relationship between the public service and ministers and their advisers. And while people have talked about the growing role of ministerial offices and advisers for decades, this week's announcement really crystallises a trend to the sidelining of the public service as a frontline provider of policy advice. Listen to the language of Scott Morrison from Thursday's press conference. The Prime Minister reflected on how he had told public servants soon after the election ""about having a very strong focus on the delivery of services because that's what Government is there to do"". ""I want a public service that's very much focussed on implementation....Whether... they're preparing research, the policy they're developing, services they're delivering on the ground and ensuring that could be done efficiently and keep Australians connected to them in the work they do each day.""   Now, there are references to the development of policy in his words. But the clear message was really about improving the way services are delivered to the public. This is an admirable goal. And, of itself, merging different parts of the bureaucracy isn't a bad idea. But it is really unclear that ""silos"" in the ""Canberra bubble"" are necessarily the real issue here. And the fact that the number of departments was slashed from 18 to 14, with five department heads losing their jobs while the number of ministers remains unchanged is very telling, and not just because of the bad optics. The underlying message from the Prime Minister is really a reflection of the fact that policy is largely driven by ministers and their offices these days, rather than a clear line of process that involves public servants, and/or the people who have been commissioned by the Government itself to advise it. The Thodey Review itself is a stunning example of this.   Once things are decided in a minister's office, the scope for even the parliament to find out what has happened is immediately constrained, particularly in an administration that thinks it is okay for one minister to decline to be interviewed by the police, or for another minister to retain his job while unable to explain how he appears to have spectacularly misled parliament, and is subject to a police investigation into forged documents.  Or for the role of ministerial advisers in various scandals to remain unclear, while they hold on to their jobs. If these new changes mean even less policy flows out of the public service, what hope have we of knowing who is making the decisions, and on what rationale, in areas that the Government doesn't feel like talking about or prioritising, like the arts? It is hard to see any discussion coming up in Estimates, for starters. Public servants are now supposed to be the facilitators of policy rather than its authors, but, in fact, particularly under Coalition governments, they have often become little more than post boxes for the outsourcing of contracts to the private sector. But think of all the bad contractual arrangements that have been exposed just this year — from the Paladin contracts in Papua New Guinea to (yet another) case of a minister distributing regional grants out of their office, outside the guidelines of the grants program — and how little transparency there is about what goes on. A telling remark from an unnamed ""senior government source"" in The Australian on Friday was that ""there is also a big wake-up call coming for the IT and tech public servants who have spent 20 years making contractors and IT companies rich by signing up for fragmented, sub-scale tech systems"".   For those of us with any memory, it's hard not to laugh out loud here. It was the Howard government who oversaw the disastrous outsourcing of the government's IT program — which was scathingly reviewed by the Auditor-General. The institutional memory of how systems had previously been set up to try to do exactly what the Prime Minister says he wants the public service to do has never recovered. Thank goodness there is the public service to blame for this, rather than actually considering what impact slogan-driven policy, lacking in any real idea or interest in how to run a government, may be playing.

37,/news/2019-12-06/parliament-2019-scott-morrison-year-in-review/11770312?section=politics,"For Scott Morrison, electoral triumph has brought a weirdly shrunken field of vision","And so ends Scomovia's first full political calendar year. A year that began with the discreet departures of Coalition megafauna convinced the jig was up, and closes with a resurgent Prime Minister kicking away the last remaining crutch of Labor's parliamentary dominance — the medevac legislation. It's been a year made remarkable by the frequency with which obstacles have disappeared from the Prime Minister's path. In recent weeks, both Mr Morrison's Lodge predecessors bade farewell to their political careers: Malcolm Turnbull with a cocktail party at Point Piper's Cruising Yacht Club (hello, sailor!) and Tony Abbott with a thousand fans at the grand ballroom of the Miramare Gardens, where MC Alan Jones (who else?) sorrowed for the ""hundreds"" turned away, not including Margie Abbott who — Mr Jones gallantly explained — was at St Vincent's hospital ""recovering comfortably"" from a lumpectomy.   The Liberal Party, too, has had a double lumpectomy with the excision of both Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull from its parliamentary ranks. One was performed by the voters of Warringah on May 18, the second a DIY day procedure performed by Mr Turnbull's own hand — and the party is left resting comfortably for the first time in a decade. Indeed, the Prime Minister is the first Liberal leader in all that time who is not obliged to sleep with one eye open. Since approximately 7:25pm on May 18 this year, when ABC election druid Antony Green turned to camera and remarked that the returns from the voting booths were looking weirdly inconsistent with what the polls were predicting, Scott Morrison has been in the historically unusual position, as leader of the Liberal Party, of being able to confidently order his stationery in bulk. The Liberal Party may be the only workplace in Australia where job security is in a purple patch right now. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that redundancies in Australia have risen by nearly half over the past two years, but within the Liberal Party, you really have to work at losing a job these days.   Being — for example — the Energy Minister really seems to bring a remarkable robustness of tenure. Twenty-eight years ago, Angus Taylor was one of Australia's Rhodes Scholars. Born and raised in Nimmitabel, NSW, Mr Taylor crossed the ocean to seek intellectual adventure and to not quite meet Naomi Wolf, an encounter he would later relate in in-Nimmitabel style in his maiden speech, from which the listener might gently infer that a young Taylor had gone to war with Oxford's Wolfian hordes of New York-raised PC warriors to defend the common room's Christmas tree. Now, everyone needs a foundation myth, and this is especially true of the crusading conservative. Oxford is the place where Tony Abbott arranged a pro-Thatcher rally during the Falklands War, after all, so it's more or less incumbent on an aspiring PM like Angus Taylor to have struck a few blows for freedom. Tragically, fresh reportage of Mr Taylor's first speech seems to have coincided this week with an unusually fallow patch in Dr Wolf's diary. The writer — who insists that she ""loves Christmas"" — has robustly sought a correction, including by means of a direct telephone call to Mr Taylor's parliamentary office, where — coincidentally enough — the phone was picked up by a staffer defiantly carrying on his boss's legacy of honouring Christmas, quite possibly with a few glasses of shiraz. Dr Wolf, who thoughtfully filmed herself making the call over Skype, subsequently posted the footage on YouTube, where it remains as a lesson to political staffers of all persuasions that sometimes it's best just to let the phone ring out. It's not like being a Rhodes scholar guarantees one the prime ministership, exactly, but it certainly doesn't hurt, as Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull could attest. Mr Abbott described his time at Oxford as ""golden"", and borrowed the British poet Frances Cornford's lovely, elegiac line to aver that the place had left him ""magnificently unprepared for the long littleness of life"".   By contrast, however, Oxford seems to have left Mr Taylor perfectly reconciled to the long littleness of life. How else would you explain a Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction whose two most widely-recorded achievements in office relate to the weed-wanding of a 30 hectare block of land near Cooma, and the apparent forgery of some local council documents? I mean — fine. Fight the fight. Make the point about the eradication of Serrated Tussock, or preoccupy yourself with taunting the failure of various City of Sydney officials to observe an absolute zero emissions policy, in a political tactic that owes more to Student Politics 101 than it does to the dreaming spires. But really — and the question needs to be asked — is that all there is? The Prime Minister has clung defiantly to his minister, even making — in the presence of his Attorney General, Christian Porter — a phone call to the NSW Police Commissioner to suss out just how strike-forcey the Strike Force into Mr Taylor was actually going to be, ballpark.   A surprising move, you might think — especially given the supervision of Mr Porter, an Attorney with established expertise in governmental telephone etiquette, having one year earlier taken the rather extraordinary step of writing to the Solicitor General and directing him not to answer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's phone calls. Whatever the ethics of Call-The-Cops-Gate, the fact remains that the Prime Minister concludes the year wreathed in bushfire smoke, besieged by parched farmers, contemplating a summer of power outages and country towns running dry, all the while lashed to an energy and climate minister who seems — to put it ultra-mildly — to have a problem with detail, not to mention appearing in public without facing shouted questions about Naomi Wolf.   For the Prime Minister, too, electoral triumph has brought a weirdly shrunken field of vision. Scott Morrison's mandate was one of the most straightforward in living political history. No Tony-Abbott-style policy creatures from the deep for this guy; Scott Morrison is a man who explicitly promised to cut personal income taxes, definitely implied that he would continue to wear a peaked cap for casual occasions, and firmly assured us that he wouldn't do any of the stuff Bill Shorten wanted. PROMISES KEPT! Aside from tax cuts, this man was essentially elected NOT to do stuff. And to be fair, he's delivered in spades. Viewed through the rear-vision mirror of history, the 2019 election tactic reveals itself as seriously brilliant; possibly the most diabolically ingenious piece of political strategy since Barnaby Joyce hit upon the idea of enhancing his family values appeal by the simple expedient of having more families. But it's created — as the sun sets on the parliamentary year of 2019, crimsoned with bushfire haze — a political equation of unbearable poignancy.   The Prime Minister with the biggest stash of political capital in a decade turns out also to be the one with the narrowest field of ambition. What are the odds, hey? On the Liberal Party's website, the Government crisply enumerates its headline achievements for the year, viz: The inclusion in the list of the introduction of an anti-union bill that history records was brought down at the last minute by a one-night stand featuring Pauline Hanson and the Australian Labor Party (imagine the morning after — heavens!) gives you a feel for what the drafting process of the list itself might have been like. ""What about religious freedom — shall we bung that in?"" ""Nope, better not. We've delayed that bill. Turns out it's really hard."" ""What about the Commonwealth Integrity Commission we announced a year ago? That done yet?"" ""Ah, nope. Also hard."" ""What about the thing we did banning the vegan farm trespassers?"" ""Hmmm. Bit niche. Also they were already banned under state laws, so."" ""What about delaying the scheduled increase to the superannuation guarantee?"" ""SHUT UP!!! We haven't even SAID that yet you IDIOT! Right. I'm shifting this to Confide."" For Labor, it is fair to say that 2019 has not gone as intended.  Rather than gloriously deploying all the money Chris Bowen had planned to recoup from franking credits and negative gearing, the party has spent the year essentially packing away the policy Christmas tree, and gloomily retraining journalists not to ask them any more what Labor would do, seeing as they're not likely to be in a position to do anything any time soon.   So deep are the wounds that they've not even had the heart for the traditional post-election-loss orgy of recrimination. Even when things have gone well, it's been in circumstances of unthinkable horror, such as this week's vote on the Ensuring Integrity Bill, which on one hand was a victory for Labor and the union movement, but on the other was the person Anthony Albanese loathes most in Australia (Pauline Hanson) teaming up with Anthony Albanese to save the hide of the dude at number 2 on the Albanese Most Loathed List — John Setka. I mean — in politics you take the win, especially if you've had a ropey year. But it's not always fun. The end of the political year always brings a few surprise Kris Kringles. For the Government, it was Pauline Hanson executing a Senate-floor reverse ferret on the Ensuring Integrity Bill and voting to defeat it, a development gently suggestive of the possibility that Senate leader Mathias Cormann may have paid more attention to ensuring the integrity of the union movement than he did to ensuring the integrity of his Senate numbers.   For the Opposition, it was Jacqui Lambie voting with the Government to upend the Medevac legislation, a shocking reversal of the Labor-backed scheme to rescue unwell refugees from the offshore detention centres opened six years ago by … who was it? Oh yeah: Labor. But who can stay angry with anyone, in a world which this week saw the reconciliation of Israel Folau and Rugby Australia? Truly, it was a Christmas miracle. From their respective trenches, which have blazed all year with gunfire, rhetoric and GoFundMe requests, the two parties emerged, shyly unfurling the snowy flag of surrender; the football star who declared that gays and drunks were going to hell, and the rugby code that sacked him. ""While it was not Rugby Australia's intention, Rugby Australia acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused to the Folaus,"" the code declared, in a written statement that coyly avoided mention of the presumably colossal sum of money it had just agreed to shovel Mr Folau's way, but whose phrasing silently confirmed that none of the loot was spent on copy editors.   Mr Folau (who a fortnight ago ventured the opinion that bushfires were God's way of getting back at humanity for gay marriage), was anxious to clear up any lingering suggestions of homophobia. ""Mr Folau wants all Australians to know that he does not condone discrimination of any kind against any person on the grounds of their sexuality and that he shares Rugby Australia's commitment to inclusiveness and diversity."" Awlrighty then. All that remains is for the Attorney-General, Mr Porter, to employ his renowned legislative needlepoint skills to fashion this mess into a workable piece of legislation. How hard can it be? After all, free speech is free speech.    And individuals should be able to express their views or live their lives according to their beliefs without other people getting all triggered and making a gigantic fuss, right? I mean, people should be more robust. The fact that this freedom ride is captained by a man who is triggered by toilet signs  is a complication — sure.

38,/news/2018-11-16/the-best-way-to-vote-in-the-victorian-legislative-council-elect/10503884,How to Vote for the Victorian Legislative Council,"It is always the case that good government and good democracy are best served by a well-informed electorate. And in the interest of Victoria's good government for the next four years, it is important that electors understand how the state's Upper House, the Legislative Council, will be elected on November 24. For if 93.9 per cent of Victorians vote in the Council as they did in 2014, using a single '1' above the line for a party ticket, then the Upper House's balance of power will be delivered to a collection of parties and candidates barely known to most Victorians. The good news is that there is an easy option for well-informed voters to control what happens to their ballot paper and influence who gets elected. That is by voting 'below the line' using optional preferential voting. As shown below, instructions on the ballot paper state you only need to number preferences from 1 to 5 below the line for a formal vote. Preferences beyond five are also formal and will be counted. The more numbered preferences you mark, the more control you have over who gets elected.   The more Victorians that use the below the line option, directing preferences to candidates of their own choice, the better the chances that voters can unpick the complex preference deals stitched together by political parties big and small It is important that Victorians understand that the electoral system used to elect the Council IS NOT the reformed Senate system introduced by the Turnbull government in 2016. The Turnbull government's reforms abolished group voting tickets, the system that allowed parties to control preferences.  The reformed Senate system put sole control over preferences in the hands of the voters, ending the ability of parties big and small to trade preferences and determine election outcomes. The new Senate system instructs voters to number 1 to 6 for parties above the line, or 1 to 12 for candidates below. Similar reforms abolishing group voting tickets have been introduced in New South Wales and South Australia. But Victoria still uses the Senate's unreformed electoral system where voters have the choice of voting above the line for only a single party square, that vote immediately allocated with the chosen party's ticket of preferences. The Senate's new system of numbering boxes above the line does not apply in Victoria. A numbered vote above the line will count only for the first preference and the first chosen party's preference ticket will be applied to the vote. The preference tickets for the Council released on the weekend reveal that all the old rorts, subterfuges and manipulations through opaque and labyrinthine preference deals are back and haunting the Legislative Council election. Any vote cast above the line by unsuspecting Victorians will be transported on a magical mystery tour across the ballot paper to help elect parties and candidates that most Victorians will never previously have heard of, and almost certainly would never have voted for. I have published all the preference tickets on the ABC's election website which you can find here. I have also prepared Legislative Council calculators that allow you to model who gets elected for different combinations of party vote. You can find them here. On my experiments with the calculators, it appears that Stuart O'Neill of the Aussie Battlers Party looks certain of election from Western Metropolitan Region. Rodney Barton of the Transport Matters Party looks almost as certain of election from Eastern Metropolitan Region. So convoluted are the preference deals that Mr O'Neill and Mr Barton will be elected as long as they can poll 0.3 per cent of the vote. Equally unknown candidates could be elected to the final seats in all eight regions.   That is unless well-informed voters break with habit and pick their own candidates by voting at least 1 to 5 below the line. There's no need to pour over the preference tickets listed above. There is no need to spend hours playing with my Legislative Council calculators to work out how the preferences flows. The quickest and easiest way to vote is pick the parties and/or candidates that you know or like, and give preferences to at least five of their candidates below the line. Then keep going for as many candidates as you know or want to give preferences to. Voting below the line in this way is quick, easy and takes less time than trying to understand the preference tickets. And it allows you determine how your preferences flow. The more voters that venture below the line and give their own preferences, the more that the endless chains of preferences handed from party to party across the ballot paper will be broken. The choice in the Legislative Council on November 24 is over who controls the house that holds the new government to account.  Better that balance of responsibility be determined by well-informed voters than unknown figures doing preference deals in the shadows.",by Antony Green - ABC Election Analyst,"November 16, 2018"
39,/news/2018-11-09/summary-of-candidates-and-parties-contesting-the-2018-victorian/10483188,Summary of Candidates and Parties Contesting the 2018 Victorian Election,"A total of 887 candidates have nominated to contest the 2018 Victorian election, nine fewer than the record 896 candidates in 2014. The numbers in the lower house, the Legislative Assembly, are down from the record 545 candidates in 2014 to the second highest on record at 507. That is an average of 5.5 candidate per seat, down from 6.2 in 2014. The numbers of candidates contesting the Legislative Council has reached a new record, rising from 351 candidates in 2014 to 380 in 2018. That's a rise from 8.8 candidates per vacancy to 9.5 candidates per vacancy. The table below summarises by party the number of candidates that have contested the lower house at elections since 1992.   Note that Fiona Patten's Reason Party was formerly known as the Australian Sex Party, and the Australian Christians as the Christian Democrats. The Victorian Socialists have contested election under different party labels over the years. The overall fall from 545 to 507 candidates masks a significant shift to the left in the party composition of nominations. Three small moral conservative parties that contested the 2014 election are no longer registered, Family First, Rise Up Australia, and the Australian Christians. Family First contested all 88 electorates in 2006, 69 in 2010 and 39 in 2014. The Australian Christian contested 30 electorates in 2014 and Rise Up Australia 32. In total this means there are 101 fewer candidates representing small parties of the right. The Australian Country Party (formerly Country Alliance) has also nominated fewer lower house candidates, just two candidates in 2018 compared to 38 in 2014 and 29 in 2010. Some of these small parties have disappeared due to amalgamations triggered by the changes to the Senate's electoral system in 2016, and similar changes to the South Australian Legislative Council's electoral system in 2018. Family First and parts of the Australian Christians have been absorbed by Corey Bernardi's Australian Conservatives, hoping to improve conservative prospects of winning Senate seats at the next federal election. The absorption of Family First into the Australian Conservatives was also a consequence of former Senator Bob Day's departure from politics. Despite having registered for the 2018 election, neither the Australian Conservatives nor Pauline Hanson's One Nation have nominated candidates for the election. This leaves a hole on the right of Victorian politics that may boost the Coalition primary vote but will have little other impact on the overall result. In several key seats, the disappearance of  moral conservative candidates leaves their support free to migrate elsewhere. Key electorates with significant support for the de-registered parties in 2014 include Cranbourne (6.3%), Narre Warren South (5.7%), Bendigo West (5.1%), Narre Warren North (5.1%), Carrum (5.0%), Ripon (4.2%), Monbulk (3.2%) and Bass (3.0%). It may also matter in Legislative Council regions where the three parties together polled the following percentages in 2014 - Eastern Metropolitan (3.3%), Eastern Victoria (3.3%), Northern Metropolitan (3.6%), Northern Victoria (3.5%), South-Eastern Metropolitan (5.3%), Southern metropolitan (1.6%), Western metropolitan (3.2%) and Western Victoria (3.1%). Most of the increase in candidate numbers has come from parties on the left of politics, with the Animal Justice party nominating 43 candidates, up from nine in 2014, and the Victorian Socialists 18 candidates, up from two Socialist Alliance candidates in 2014. The next table summarises the number of candidates per electorate at elections since 1992.   The electorate of Melton has attracted the most candidates with 12. There are 11 candidates in Morwell and 10 in Bentleigh, Mordialloc and Ripon. There are nine electorates with only three candidates, Liberal, Labor and the Greens. These electorates are Box Hill, Bulleen, Evelyn, Ferntree Gully, Gembrook, Gippsland South, Mount Waverley, Ringwood and Sunbury. Seven of these electorates are Liberal held seats in Melbourne's east. There is no Liberal candidate in the inner-Melbourne seat of Richmond, leaving Labor and the Greens to battle each other without the influence of Liberal preferences mattering. There are three three-cornered contests where both the Liberal and National Party's have nominated candidates, Bendigo East, Morwell and Shepparton. The Liberal Party have not nominated candidates in the seven seats with a sitting National MP. Victoria continues to use the group voting ticket system that was abolished for the Senate ahead of the 2016 Federal election. As a result, it has attracted a host of small parties that will spend the next two days haggling over preference deals.   Ballot draw can have a significant impact on the success of a party. Some of the more significant ballot draws are - In 2014 the Liberal Democrats drew to the right of Liberals/Nationals in five regions and polled 1.3%, 1.5%, 2.4%, 1.7% and 2.6%. They polled twice as high in the three regions where they drew to the left of the Liberal/Nationals, polling 4.7%, 4.6% and 5.5%. In 2018 the Liberal Democrats are left of the Liberal/Nationals in Eastern Metropolitan, Eastern Victoria, Northern Metropolitan and Northern Victoria. The Labor Party may strike the same problem in 2018 with the DLP appearing on ballot papers as Labour DLP. The DLP appear to the left of the Australian Labor Party in Northern Metropolitan and Western Metropolitan.","Antony Green, ABC Election Analyst","November 09, 2018"
40,/news/2018-11-05/why-the-results-in-wentworth-narrowed/10446090,Why the Results in Wentworth Narrowed,"Despite Kerryn Phelps appearing the clear winner of the Wentworth by-election on election night, victory looked less certain twelve hours later after a dramatic narrowing of her lead. On election night I called a victory for Kerryn Phelps at 7:18pm. Before 9pm Phelps herself claimed victory, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Liberal candidate Dave Sharma conceded defeat. The predicted swing at 7:18 was little changed by 10:30pm. The result for every polling place had been reported and the predicted win for Phelps looked secure. By all past postal and pre-poll vote trends in Wentworth, Phelps' lead was unassailable. Yet by lunchtime on Sunday Phelps' lead was only 884 votes and her two-candidate preferred (2CP) result only 50.6%. Liberal Party hopes of victory rose. By 6pm on Sunday Phelps was clearly back on track to win as the cause of the narrowing became apparent. So what happened? Had I called the result to early. Had the Liberal Party with its own data made the same mistake? Had we all forgotten about the ""Jewish vote"" in Wentworth? In this post I'll explore what caused the post-election day narrowing. In short, everyone underestimated how the Phelps campaign peaked on polling day and that it was less organised than the Liberal Party when postal voting began. The government's late campaign wobbles may have boosted Phelps' polling day performance. There are also oddities with the postal and pre-poll votes, and the result is a warning on how to deal with absent votes, a missing category of votes at by-elections. The graph below charts two measures of two-candidate preferred percentage for Kerryn Phelps against the percentage vote counted. The blue line is the actual 2CP% and includes counting on subsequent days. The black line is a projected 2CP% for Phelps calculated from the progressive count on election night. The projection has been calculated by the matched swing method used by most election analysts and parties to accurately predict results. The gold line is the final result, Phelps winning with 51.2% after preferences. Dashed vertical lines in the graph highlight three important turning points in the 15 hours after the last polling place reported. The first line marks when the result for the large and strongly Liberal voting Rose Bay pre-poll voting centre was entered. The second marks the entry of the first batch of strongly Liberal postal votes. The third dashed line marks when election preference count errors from the night before were corrected during the check count on Sunday. The check count correction doubled Phelps' lead and removed the doubt over her victory that had emerged on Sunday morning.   The matched swing prediction method works by first calculating a swing comparing percentage votes by party at the current election with the percentage vote by party at the previous election in the same polling places. This matched swing is then applied to the overall result of the last election to produce a relatively stable predicted result. The reason for using swing rather than 2CP% is that the swing is less variable by polling place than the 2CP%. In Wentworth the polling place Liberal 2CP% rose from a low of 27.2% to a high 68.6%, a range of 41% and a standard deviation of 11.3. The swing was between -15.0 and -30.9 per polling place, a much smaller range of 15.9% and standard deviation of 3.9. As the swing has a much smaller standard deviation, the progressive swing figure used to make the prediction stabilises more quickly than the 2CP%. That is shown clearly in the above graph, the blue line of 2CP% bouncing around much more than the black prediction line based on swing. With all polling places counted, representing 50.5% of enrolled votes from a likely final turnout of under 80%, Phelp's 2CP% was 54.4%. Using the matched swing that takes account of the trend in postal, pre-poll and absent votes at the last election, Phelps' predicted 2CP% was 53.3%. With 54.4% of the two candidate preferred vote with all polling places reporting and half the vote counted, and with an expected turnout of 80%, the Liberal Party needed to poll 57.7% on pre-polls and postals to overcome Phelps' lead. The predicted Phelps figure of 53.3% assumed Phelps would poll 51.1% of the votes to come. In fact she polled only 45.5%, which is why her victory margin was a narrower 51.2%. When you call an election result, you are saying that the candidate has a large enough two-candidate preferred lead to be certain they cannot lose from that point. The call of victory for Phelps on election night proved correct as her lead was large enough to withstand even the unexpectedly large narrowing that occurred. Every electorate has a particular trend in postal, pre-poll and absent votes that you factor in when making a prediction. It is true that the high ""Jewish"" vote in  Wentworth gives a particular trend to postal and pre-poll trends. That particular trend in Wentworth was factored into the by-election night prediction. As I will describe below, the post-election night counting trend at the Wentworth by-election was very different to the trend seen in Wentworth at elections over the past two decades. Compared to all previous elections in Wentworth, the surge in support for the Liberal Party in pre-poll and postal voting was much greater than seen before. The graph below plots the percentage point difference in Liberal 2CP% for Absent, Postal and Pre-poll votes compared to votes cast on polling day in Wentworth at elections since 1996. The dashed line shows the difference between polling day votes and the overall result for Wentworth.   The graph shows clearly that Liberal support is much higher for Postal votes than for votes cast on polling day. Liberal 2CP% support has consistently been 10-13 percentage points higher than polling day votes. At the by-election the final postal vote difference was 14.8%, though the figure was 19% compared to the first batches of postal votes reported. Pre-Poll votes have also been stronger for the Liberal Party, usually 2-5 percentage points higher, but at the Wentworth by-election double this figure at 10 percentage points higher. The Absent vote trend has been very different, the Liberal 2CP% consistently 6-8 percentage points lower than on polling day. There were no Absent votes at the by-election. An Absent vote is one cast outside of a voter's home division on election day. Absent votes measure the propensity for voters to be outside of their electorate on polling day. Absent voters are more likely to live nearer the edge of the electorate. In the case of Wentworth, geography means that a voter who lives in Elizabeth Bay, Clovelly or Randwick, is more likely  to vote Absent in a neighbouring electorate than a voter from Liberal heartland in of Vaucluse and Rose Bay. For that reason, Absent voting in Wentworth tends to be less favourable for the Liberal Party than polling day votes. The inclusion of Absent Votes usually knocks around 0.5 percentage points off the Liberal Party 2CP% in Wentworth. Had Absent votes been excluded from the last election totals at the Wentworth by-election, the predicted result for Phelps on election night would have been reduced from 53.3% to 52.8%. Something similar happened at the 2012 by-election in the Victorian state seat of Melbourne, when including Absent votes from the previous election resulted in an over-prediction of the Green vote. It may be best to exclude Absent votes from an electorate's history when analysing by-elections.   Focussing on the dashed line comparing polling day results with final results, between 1996 and 2016, the largest post-election night shift in Liberal 2CP% seen previously was 1.5% in 2013 and 1.2% in 2016. At the by-election the gap more than  doubled to 4%. The narrowing from Phelps' by-election night margin wasn't because I hadn't factored in the Postal and Pre-poll votes. It was because I hadn't predicted that the difference between votes cast on polling day and votes cast would be so much greater than seen previously in Wentworth. That the gap was larger is a reflection of the swing being larger on polling day compared to votes cast before polling day. The two-candidate preferred swing against the Liberal Party was 21.8% on polling day, 15.2% in Pre-poll votes, and 17.0% with Postal votes. If the swing on polling day had been the same as that recorded amongst votes cast before polling day, the Liberal Party would have won the Wentworth by-election. More than 12,800 postal vote applications were received, processed and ballot papers dispatched. 9,003 postal votes were returned and admitted to the count. Once you include postal votes returned but rejected from the count for a variety of reasons, the return rate is around 75%, normal for a by-election. Of the postal vote applications received, 3,713 were via the AEC's on-line postal vote application. 5,913 were received via paper application forms, almost all of which were prompted by a Liberal Party mail-out. Another 3,234 were for registered general postal voters. Voters who are old, ill or otherwise infirm, are registered as silent voters, or who have religious objections to voting on a Saturday, can choose to be registered as general postal voters. General postal voters are sent postal vote packs as soon as nominations are closed without the need for an application. (You can find out who is entitled to be a general postal voter at the AEC website.) Voters can apply for a postal vote as soon as the date of the election is known. Postal votes packs are dispatched on the Monday after the close of nominations, and Pre-poll voting starts on the Tuesday after the close of nominations. Applications for Postal votes close the Wednesday before polling day. The graph below plots the total Postal vote applications by day and the total Pre-poll votes cast.    The huge increase in postal vote applications a few days before the close of nominations corresponds to general postal voters being added to the mail-out list. The graph shows that by the close of nominations, around 7,000 postal vote packs were ready for mail-out. These votes were overwhelmingly general postal voters and early responders to the Liberal Party's postal vote application. Of Pre-poll voters, roughly 8,000 were cast in the two weeks after the close of nominations, and 10,000 were cast in the last week of the campaign, the numbers peaking on the Thursday and Friday before polling day. Presumably the early postal votes were a large proportion of the roughly 5,000 postal votes received, processed and counted on election night for inclusion on the Sunday morning. These votes were overwhelmingly in favour of the Liberal Party. The graph below plots the Liberal 2CP% in the Postal vote count with each day's counting. As the plot shows, the Liberal 2CP% slipped every day. On first preferences, the first batch of postal votes split Liberal; 57.3%, Phelps 17.2%, Labor 12.4% and Greens 4.8%. By the last batch, the first preferences were Liberal 35.4%, Phelps 31.8%, Labor 14.4% and the Greens 11.9%.   Assuming the postal vote receipts by the AEC reflect when votes were completed and returned, there are two possible explanations for the postal vote trend. The first is logistical, that the Phelps campaign was disorganised at the start of the campaign and did not have a well organised postal vote strategy. The Liberal advantage in the general postal votes and early applications was reflected in the early returned postal votes being stronger for the Liberal Party. A second may reflect the campaign itself, with the Phelps campaign peaking on election day. The Liberal Party spent the last 10 days of the campaign either trying to stamp out political bushfires, or trying to contain their own political backburns that had got out of control. But that doesn't explain why the Pre-polls were so solid for the Liberal Party. If it was the last 10 days of the campaign that lost Wentworth for the government, why wasn't this reflected in the Pre-poll votes given how many were cast in the last days? The answer may be in the positioning of the Pre-poll Voting Centres. At the 2016 Federal election there were four Pre-Poll Voting centres, Haymarket (720 votes, Liberal 2CP 58.9%), Waverley (10,509, 73.2%), Randwick (1,820, 62.1%) and Sydney Town Hall (2,174, 66.1%). There were also 3,830 pre-polls taken outside of the electorate with Liberal 2CP of 62.9%. Only the Waverley Pre-Poll Voting Centres was within the boundaries of Wentworth. At the by-election, two new centres within the electorate were used. The four pre-poll centres were Haymarket (1,142 votes, Liberal 2CP 39.4%), Paddington (3,424, 43.1%), Rose Bay (6,781, 69.7%) and Waverley (7,106, 49.5%). There were only 306 external pre-polls recording a Liberal 2CP of 37.2%. It may be that the smaller swing on pre-polls reflects a change in where pre-poll voting centres were located. In 2016 7,800 pre-poll votes were recorded at pre-poll centres outside of the electorate where the Liberal vote was lower than within the electorate. At the by-election, 6,781 pre-polls taken in the Liberal heart of the electorate at Rose Bay where the Liberal Party vote was stronger than recorded in any polling place on election day. There was a drop in votes cast at nearby polling places on the day. The Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre was on New South Head Road in the Rose Bay shopping centre, the main transport route through to the strongest Liberal voting parts of the electorate. The Rose Bay Pre-Poll centre may have re-arranged when and where people voted in Liberal parts of the electorates, which explains why the Pre-Poll trend was so different. A final note to make about Postal and Pre-Poll votes is the rise in their use. In 1996 82.7% of all votes were cast in polling places in Wentworth on polling day. Postal Votes comprised 3.9% of votes and Pre-Poll Votes 6.0%. At the 2016 election polling day votes were 61.6% of all votes, Postal Votes 11.2% and Pre-Poll Votess 23.4%. The numbers for the by-election were not significantly different, 65.3% on the day votes, Postals 10.8% and Pre-Polls 23.4% While the numbers of Postal and Pre-poll votes has increased over the last two decades, the change between the 2016 election and the by-election was not significant enough to have an impact on election night predictions. There are several trends that resulted in the overnight narrowing of the election result. There may also be an issue with the composition of the final two candidates. If the by-election had been a contest between Labor and Liberal, I suspect the swing would have been more uniform. With Kerryn Phelps being the Liberal Party's opponent, there were cross cutting issues that allowed Liberal voters to switch to Phelps that were different for Labor or Green voters switching to Phelps. There was always the chance that the swing across the electorate would vary more than normal. That didn't happen as the polling day swing was very uniform. Instead, the difference in swing between polling day votes and votes cast before polling day was much greater than expected and much larger than previously recorded in Wentworth.","Antony Green, ABC Election Analyst","November 05, 2018"
